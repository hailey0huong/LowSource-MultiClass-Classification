 Round table had a pretty decent lunch buffet reasonably priced at 6 bucks the only down fall was they would lag on keeping fresh pizza available. Went there again last week and they raised the price and now it doesn't include a drink. For about $ 10 now I think I'll pass. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Not impressed. Name of restaurant does not live up to what they serve.I don't think it's even Korean bbq .They marinate the meat in some simple way, a bit tasteless actually, that is not typically Korean I find. Korean bbq marinated meat.... It's usually a bit sweet and packs a lot more flavor. The fried dumplings were actually quite terrible, the filling was mushy inside and had a bad texture. And the kimchi, well...I'm no kimchi expert, but it didn't taste very appetizing. It was not sour enough for my liking. Service was inconsistent. I was served by 6 or 7 different people. Dinner cost was overpriced. $21.99 for all you can eat. Plus was, meat seemed fresh, came in nice small portions. Service was also generally pleasant. Atmosphere was close to high-end, the walls changed colors....reminded me a bit of a club, Anyway I would not pay 21.99$ for this kind of food. I'd prefer to pay the lunch price which is 13.99$.

 Visiting from the San Franciso Bay Area, very impressed to have this veg oasis not far from our hotel. We arrived only 10 minutes before they stopped serving lunch, and they had everything ready really quickly - about 10 minutes: rice paper rolls, lemongrass faux chicken, a vegetable curry chow mein, and brown rice to go. The lemongrass dish, while a bit meager -- 13 bite-sized pieces of deep-fried yumminess on a piece of lettuce -- was really tasty. The rice paper rolls were uninspiring. The chow mein was okay. The brown rice was exceptionally good. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I spend a lot of time in bars (maybe I shouldn't say that..) but one of the best times I've ever had in a bar was, hands down, my trip to Quark's. While I'm not a huge Trekkie, I did love Deep Space Nine and enjoyed Voyager quite a bit. I even watched Enterprise when it came out, though mostly because Scott Bakula was in it. We happened to be in Vegas the weekend of the Star Trek convention, so coming to Quark's was even more of an experience since, in addition to the people that worked there being dressed in Trekkie outfits, most of the patrons were too. We ordered the Holy Rings of Betazed to split amongst the table and they were delicious. After that, the trip is a little bit fuzzy since I started drinking their yummy Acturian Fizzes (Lemon Rum, 151 Rum, lemonade and strawberry puree) and drank them steadily for the next five or six hours. Being pretty geeky myself, a large part of the reason I came here was for my Hot Nerd Quest. I remember telling one of the actors that came to our table dressed as a Romulan about this. When she asked if I was armed for my quest, I pointed to my substantial cleavage in a low cut shirt, and she cocked her eyebrow and said, ""Indeed."" A friend that was with me and well past the tipsy point, was fascinated with the Borg and kept asking him if he was anatomically correct, to which he replied, ""Interface would be successful."" It's also a plus that this place is located on the monorail, making it easy to get to, especially if you've been drinking steadily. Between the characters in costume, the bar that looked just like Quark's in Deep Space Nine, and the tasty onion rings and even tastier drinks, I will definitely be coming here every time that I'm in Vegas, especially if the Star Trek convention is in town. Honestly, I wish there was one of these in my own town. I'd be there a lot. Probably too much. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We bought an Aspen Home Downing Street partners desk from Jason and we are so pleased with both the piece and the customer service we have received. Jason was very helpful, informative and patient with us when we were deciding on what we wanted. He was also available via email to finalize the purchase which made the transaction very convenient on our behalf. We have also dealt with Joe and Marcus from Salt Creek Office Furniture who were both just as great! Our study is the first room you see when you walk into our home so we wanted something that would be elegant and make a statement. We couldn't have chosen a better office set! We receive many compliments on the desk and have referred all of our friends and family to Salt Creek Office Furniture. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Located inside Aria, this is a fancy looking cocktail lounge with great music. I liked how everything was so nicely set up. Someone would come by every now and then to clean up your table and to reorganize things nicely as they were each time. The reason why I gave them 2 stars however is because of the cocktail. I tried 2 of their signature cocktails, but I felt like they really weren't that good especially considering the price. Perhaps it was supposed to be a savory cocktail or something, but it all just tasted to funky for me. I requested for something really sweet, and that was the recommendation I got. If you are looking for somewhere ""nice"" atmosphere wise, this is the place to go to, but otherwise don't go. ",0,1,0,0,0

 First, qdoba is delicious. Second, this particular location has free parking which is odd for a place in the city. So it gets half the stars just for that. The qdoba in Oakland has zero parking. Third, it's right next to a chipotle in case you change your mind between parking and ordering. Finally qdoba has quesso, it's delicious and the only reason I go. We can all agree that both chipotle and qdoba are magnificent and we don't need all this hate and vitriol in the burrito eating community. Burritos come from a place of love. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I love this restaurant so much. If you're a relatively light eater, the stone crab claws are a good portion and very delicious. Otherwise, there are larger orders of steak or seafood as well as the typical upscale sides such as creamed corn and spinach.

 I actually like this place: Only because of the attentive staff and the dishes were quite tasty! The ambiance is Terrible. If you Love to eat...knowledgeable and particular about your Foods, and looking for that exclusive dining service- you will probably like it here. The shaboo is an 11 course meal. You have a server all to yourself, cleaning up after you and bringing out each dish. Each dish is very small: There are different sashimi dishes, caviar, Kobe beef, and my Favorite- Foie Gras...! Tasty little dishes that melt right in your mouth! This restaurant is not very romantic or Fun because it is lacks warmth and people. It IS expensive as you are paying for the experience and the grade A fish and meats... But, when in Vegas- once is enough. =) ",0,0,0,1,0

 Atelier d'Argentine is a relatively new restaurant on the Montreal dining scene set in the space previously occupied by Derek Dammann's DNA. Previously, the incredibly modern setting made sense - DNA was known for its experimental but always delicious haute cuisine. Upon entering Atelier d'Argentine, I was surprised to see that not much has changed - not even to suit the style and feel of an Argentinean steakhouse. Same glass partitions, same industrial lighting, same steel d \ u00e9cor. Hmmm. In any case, I heard so much about this restaurant through social media and was excited to finally try it. A delicious piece of red meat is always welcome in my carnivorous diet! We started with the fennel, watercress, citrus and sugar-roasted almond salad. It was delicious! So fresh, with great contrasting textures and just the right amount of dressing. Good start. Next, we both chose the grilled hanger steak with chimichurri & criolla sauce. A medium-rare, properly prepared hanger steak can be an amazing-tasting piece of meat. It also doesn't need much fuss around it - usually salt and pepper are just enough to enhance the taste. Unfortunately, this hanger steak wasn't so great. The cut was sub-par and the taste was... Seriously MIA. Here, the lack of spice really brought out the bland and somewhat stringy piece of meat. The chimichurri wasn't bad but the dish, on the whole, was unfortunate. Finally, we split the caramel stuffed crepes with honey roasted walnuts, saut \ u00e9ed bananas and milk semifreddo. Like the hanger steak, the dessert was unimpressive and lacked finesse. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. It seems that Atelier d""Argentine is going through a bit of an identity crisis. It's trying to be a serious restaurant - occupying DNA's space leaves them with large shoes to fill - but it's also trying to be ""fly"" and ""happening"". On Thusday night, the restaurant hosts its ""Besame"" event: after 10pm, their menu becomes less expensive and the party atmosphere heats up. I'm not saying Atelier d'Argentine is attempting the impossible, but it's trying to do too much too fast. Before earning a positive reputation as a restaurant, it's trying to enter the Old Port party scene. I've never seen that end well...

 The ""Chances Are"" that you don't have much time left if you are caught in this place. Look, I have nothing against the aged - I am getting there myself... But really, this is a 100% geriatric establishment. There should be a social security card machine to make sure you were born before Ronald Regan to get in here. The decor is beat-up 80's - something like a thrift store. The bar is large and mostly deserted. I assume the food is as flavorful as an inner tube - I didn't stay long enough to find out. Sometimes places need to die (just like we all do someday). I'll likely end up in here in about 25-years. LOL ",0,1,0,0,0

 Easy in and out, love that part! TSA security is the worst. No help, no smiles, to slow, don't care. No preferred line. Generally a dirty airport (delta terminal). All the food courts are at one end of the terminal, so you have to walk from one end to the other just to get a cup of coffee or bite to eat!

 In short - Terrible wait staff. Water that tasted like watered down sprite. Overpriced what is essence fried rice with a little protein. Disgusting bathrooms. We sat at a tepan table and was immediately moved to another in the corner of the restaurant. There was a family of 4 sitting there. 2 adults - 2 kids both under 2yrs old. We saw that the other family had already ordered sushi and it looked decent, so we decided to order 2 rolls our self to nosh on while we waited for our tepan food. WELL....we were informed that if we wanted sushi before our meal, we'd have to move to yet another table since that family had been waiting for a while. I inform the server that we'll stay at the table and still order sushi. The miso that is brought out is broth with 2 slices of mushroom. The salad was terrible. We order our tepan food and wait 30minutes before a chef comes to our table. The family said they were waiting 20minutes before their order was taken and had been without a chef for an hour. The restaurant was not that busy. Though the main course was decent....it's overpriced. Oh and that sushi we ordered...didnt come until AFTER we were ready for the check. Apparently there's another tepan restaurant further west according to my brother. Next time we're having my mom babysit and are in the mood for tepan, we'll keep driving. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have to say that the place is new, pretty nice inside, the bartender was good. And started to get busy while we were there.... All we ordered food wise was the pretzels which came out slow, but hit and they tasted great. We had 3 beers and a Bloody Mary between the two of us and our bill was as $51. I know this is Vegas and things may cost a little more. However, $11 for Angry Orchard is ridiculous. I know how much they pay for their legs and they are purposely gouging you on the cost of their draft beer. $51 for 2 pretzels and some beers. Lame. I wouldn't suggest or come back based on how expensive it is. I should add I have visited a Tilted Kilt in Arizona and it was not nearly as expensive. Vegas prices will keep me from ever coming back.

 This is a great place to grab a quick sandwich. The quality is FAR superior to Subway and it's just slightly more expensive. I've never had to wait long either.

 I have been to this restaurant now on 3 occasions. The first time was EXCELLENT! Wonderful service, great food and very enjoyable. The second time was also very good, but my friend did not enjoy her meal as much. And then there was this last time I went which prompted this review. Here are the details: I was with a Party of 8 We were ordering lots of wine, appetizers, salads and food - we had money to spend. Service was terrible! They never brought us any bread. We had to pour our own wine the whole evening and would have ordered more if they checked on us. They didn't change our plates out between appetizers and salad - we had to ask them to do it - and the servers barely checked in on us. The last time I came the service was excellent. This time it was appalling for a restaurant of this caliber. I've had better service at Denny's! The food was just okay and some of it, like the lobster we ordered as an appetizer for the table, was tough, chewy and just not good! Extremely disappointing! The steaks were pretty tasty and for the most part pretty good but no better or distinguished than any other steaks from a high end steak house. I was embarrassed. I had such a good experience before and recommended this place to my friends who all have serving experience and dining experience and this place was such a disappointment this time around. All I kept thinking was that if Tom Colicchio knew the low quality of service and the quality of some of the product coming out, he would be very disappointed and not want his name on this. I will not be recommending this place again, nor will I be going back. With all the fine dining experiences I could have in Vegas, I'm not wasting any more money on this place. Too bad. My first experience was so good. Look elsewhere if you want a fine dining experience. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I first tasted their food at Taste of Charlotte. Its dam good. The problem is the next two times I called them they said they ran out of food (both times were about an hour before close). I went the other day on a Saturday around 6 pm and they had food. Now for the bad... Service is VERY slow Parking is AWFUL Location is AWFUL and SMALL Layout is BAD - register is in the middle of the floor and dining area is split in two. Running out of food is UNACCEPTABLE Hours are not the greatest either No loyalty program was presented to me, even though they did have one. The food is the best BBQ in the city (its better than Midwood IMO) but Id be very concerned that all of the negatives above are going to end up being their downfall. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I had an opportunity to stay at this fine establishment this week and I was very impressed considering this is a Holiday Inn. I generally stay away from the standard lower budget business hotels after more than a few bad experiences. I was however very impressed by this location. It appears that the owners had recently gut out an older hotel and remodeled the entire place. The end result is modern, clean, comfortable and quite appealing to the eye. I ate in the breakfast cafe three mornings and the service was wonderful, friendly and prompt. The neighborhood is quiet and you are convenient to everything and anything. Scottsdale is just down the road 5 minutes and there is easy access to the expressways. Each room is an actual suite with a separate bedroom area, refrigerator, microwave and small bar sink. Two TVs, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. large closet and plenty of drawers for clothes. There is a large desk if you need to work and a pullout sofa for extra sleeping. As I was working in the gazebo one morning on my laptop I thought what a wonderful stay cation spot this would be if I lived in the Phoenix area. The price is right and if you stay in the courtyard you wouldn't guess for a minute that you were in Phoenix. There is also a lovely full bar in the lobby and a restaurant as well. So grab a bottle of wine and some microwave popcorn and settle in. This is the place to stay! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Honey Bear's BBQ has a few great BBQ options. For a Phoenix BBQ joint, it is top of line in quality. I can not say as much for the service or atmosphere. As far as basic BBQ menu options go, Honey Bear's is where it is at in Phoenix. I love their pulled pork sandwich and their sauce is fantastic. They have a great variety of sides to go along with it as well. I found their ribs meat to be delicious, however, it was pretty fatty at some parts. I have definitely had better elsewhere in the country. Honey Bear's would be a four star restaurant with a few steps in the right direction towards improving costumer service and the costumer's dining experience. First, get wait staff the goes around and ask costumers about how they are enjoying their meal and if they could get them anything else to make their meal more enjoyable. Then, remove the ads from the table and reinvest profits into the business. Pro-tip: Watch where you park so your car does not get towed. And be sure to check in on yelp to redeem your offer.

 We were visiting family in AZ and it seems that this is everybody's favorite meeting spot for dinner and drinks in the area. Sure enough, the place looks super busy, with friendly service and a solicitous hostess. We sat on the patio and admired the world going by, had good conversation going and ordered some drinks. The margarita special was served in tall water glasses, filled to the brim with ice and very light on the tequila - at least to my East Coast palate (I've had drinks in TX, CA and Mexico that put everything else to shame, so...). Chips and salsa appeared quickly and they are nothing special, but okay. Now to the food. It is in one word terrible! This is not Southwestern Mex, Tex or any kind of Mex, it is just awful! The Shrimp Tequila Ceviche had canned Thai mini-shrimp in it, and was watered down a lot. I had no time to finish it since the main dishes came out practically 2 minutes later. On the advice of several family members I ordered the Chile Rellenos and another of us visitors ordered one of Kelli's combos, I think it had the green corn something or other. Okay, those chiles were flat, flat, flat, were swimming in grease, had a thick blanket of cheese on them and had probably spent some time in the microwave and under the lamps. The refried beans looked like they had been diluted with water and whizzed in a blender and the rice was close to inedible. The green corn tamales were nothing to write home about. Only the steak fajitas were somewhat palatable. Our local family appeared to be faithful patrons, so we kept mum, but I doubt that this restaurant would warrant a return visit unless they get their act together in terms of expediting the food properly, not watering down drinks and definitely in the food quality sector.

 Beautiful cafe with fresh crepes, gelato, sandwiches, pastries and delicious Illy coffee drinks. The ""Amore"" which is their version of an Irish Coffee (non-alcoholic) sent me into a sugar coma. Imagine amaretto at the bottom of the glass, then a shot of espresso and fresh whipped cream on top. Sip the espresso through the cream and you'll be so full that you won't want anything else. But save room for some gelato too... or have an Affagato to satisfy your craving for both. It's 2 scoops of gelato with espresso poured over. Yummm... It's a beautifully bright and cheery place.

 This is only a destination because of the prime restaurants that bring me downtown. The fountain show is neat to see at night, but other than that there isn't much to walk around a see while you're waiting for your dinner reservation. The indoor shops are very pieced together and not as trendy and interesting as they could be for the venue. Beware the open parking lot. The best thing I can find in me to say about them is that they are blatantly indifferent crooks. I've never been more insulted in my life and will never park in that lot again. The short story: as I was looking at the total due on-screen, the attendant was telling me a higher price. Self-tipping, theft, call it what you will - it's wrong.

 Not a big fan of Vegas, but was on the way back from picking up a car in Salt Lake City and tried Hotel Tonight and got a deal on the room... I ignored my friends that recommended different hotels. Not being a regular at Vegas, I trusted Hotel Tonight's categorization that said it was on the Strip (It's well off the Strip I found) Check in was convoluted, had to walk through the casino from parking lot to check in, Atmosphere was like a frat house. Room- no coffee maker, everything cost $, the safe wasn't cleared, so I couldn't use it, the ironing board was missing, so I ironed my shirt on the floor, the TV was an OLD LCD that had jacked up aspect ratios that didn't auto sync, so the picture was horrible...

 We were there for Thanksgiving weekend. We booked through last minute through Expedia. Just grateful to get a room I was surprised when we checked in that we were assigned a suite in the Rush Tower at no extra charge. The four stars are for the room which was beautiful. The bathroom was huge with a walk in closet. The minus one star is for the very loud air conditioner, so loud you couldn't hear the TV. The other negative was the parking. On Friday night we arrived at the valet at 9:00 pm and told there were no openings and to go to the other valet. That valet also had no openings and were directed to the parking garage where there was a long line of cars all seeking an open parking space that didn't exist. After spending 30 minutes in the lot we were directed to the Plaza lot and told we would be reimbursed the $5.00 fee. After hearing our plight the nice attendant at the Plaza didn't charge us the fee. After spending another 30 min in this lot with no luck I finally found a group leaving and slowly followed them to their car. When I checked out the next morning the desk clerk asked if I needed help with my luggage. I told her sure if she had someone available to trek to the back of the building then across the street and through a construction zone to get to my car. She declined. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I didn't pay for this, it was comp'd. I'm a baller like that. I walked up to the cashier and she said, quite rudely ""you're Katie??????"" I answered with a confident ""I AM."" I guess when you see a 29 yr old girl alone in a buffet line at 9am with a free voucher, it's questionable but I didn't let that deter me. Even the beverages are self serve here. I guess you tip the wait staff for taking away your plates. They at least do that adequately. I wasn't offered champagne and wasn't sure it was an option until the table across from me got a bottle. I would've at least appreciated the choice. Speaking of choice, I really should discuss the food. I had 3 plates and finished with soft serve ice cream. After taking a small bite out of each item, I managed to lose my appetite. My plate-taker-awayer must've been confused at the plates he was taking away as they were all barely touched. There were even ""crab legs"" that weren't memorable. As a fat girl who jumps at the chance for free food, this is not acceptable. I filled up on Diet Pepsi (why is it impossible to get a Diet Coke in Vegas??) coffee, ginger from the sushi bar and melted soft serve. I understand when you put cobbler in the bottom of the bowl, or if the bowl is warm, the ice cream will melt. My bowl was cold and the ice cream was soup by the time I returned to my table. I remember going to the Excalibur buffet as a youngster and my family getting out of line because it was so repulsive looking. It was like that scene in ""Vegas Vacation"" where Cousin Eddie takes them to the buffet. That being said, The Big Belly Buffet is leaps and bounds above that status... but in a city of Wicked Spoons and Bacchanals, your money is best spent elsewhere. Again, it was free. C'est la vie.

 What a cool name! And what a cool place! I went into this shop when I first moved to Bruntsfield and agreed with Schwartzenegger - I would indeed be back. They have a lovely selection of shoes and the whole place was decorated really tastefully. However, the shop is small and space is limited, ... shoes are therefore limited. I would be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed that there were only a few pairs of shoes out. They were lovely shoes too - heels, flats, boots - I bought a gorgeous pair of brown patent ankle boots. I also bought a really nice, unusual purple belt which I always get compliments on. It was a nice shop and has a great deal of potential, I just wish there was a greater selection. I've not been back since that first visit - partly because I had a feeling it would be the same stock and partly because I know I would spend more money if I did, but I peer in the window now and again to keep an eye out. It;s definitely worth a visit if you happen to be in the area, but don't go to any trouble. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The Eiffel Tower Restaurant sits on the 11th floor of the Paris' Eiffel Tower replica in Las Vegas; it provides a decor, atmosphere and dining experience that is fitting with its name (which you may either enjoy or find cheesy depending on your likes/dislikes). A private glass elevator takes guests up to the restaurant (kind of an interesting view of floors and activity on the way up and the way back down). The elevators opens up to the kitchen where the chefs plate the food. The restaurant utilizes an old-fashioned dining room--plush red seating and white tablecloth--but the stodginess of it is cut dramatically by the view and utilization of the Eiffel Tower's metal legs within the restaurant. The tables are strategically placed so that many tables have a great view of The Strip (with the primary attraction being the Bellagio Fountains). Lots of big floor-to-ceiling windows create the great view. The metal framework cuts into the restaurant and it gives it kind of an art deco feel. The art deco feel with the old-fashioned decor really make this place feel like a restaurant from another era. They started us off with a cream soup amuse bouche that was okay but not great. The complimentary bread was also okay but not memorable. We had some appetizers. The lobster Pain Perdu was kind of like a lobster bread souffle. It was okay though not great. We also had some sea scallops that were served in a wine sauce with onions. The scallops dish was also just okay. The scallops were tender and seasoned right. I've had much better though in terms of scallops (both in outside sear and moistness) as well as the accompanying sauces and sides. We also had a little bit of their cold seafood platter, which included lobster, shrimp, crab, oysters, and clams. This is not my favorite type of starter (I would rather have hot seafood where the chefs get a little more creative in how they garnish/sauce/cook the seafood). Everything was okay, but nothing really stood out here. I had the venison chop as my entree. The venison chop had a nice red color, but it was not that juicy. The meat was tender enough and had a decent though not spectacular flavor. The huckleberry reduction sounded good, but it did not really do much here (not a particularly prominent flavor on the plate). The main side to the venison chop was an oatmeal cake. This is the second time I've had oatmeal with dinner (the other time was Bistro LQ). This would not be my favorite side--not bad (definitely tastes like oatmeal). The plate also featured black trumpet mushrooms and these were pretty good. They had a nice crunch to them. I also tried one of the a la carte slides--classic potato gratin. It was kind of lukewarm. The potatoes were tender but a little bland (and lacked a creamy cheesy flavor). While almost all of the food was average, the dessert was a real winner. I had the chocolate souffle and it was probably one of the best chocolate souffles I've had. It had a great chocolate flavor (they served it with a chocolate ganache, which was also good). What separated the chocolate souffle was the texture. Very nicely baked. Great texture and great lift. Chocolate souffles are hard to get right. They are typically dry, spongy or liquidy. This one though was pretty close to perfect. I also had some vanilla ice cream, which was creamy but pretty standard stuff. Service was good in terms of getting the food out at a good pace even though the restaurant was incredibly busy (which also caused the restaurant to be quite warm and loud). I felt though that the waiter was not as good as some of the other waiters I've had recently. He did a good enough job, but I felt he was a little stuffy. I think he could have been a little more personable and relaxed. Las Vegas restaurants are typically overpriced and Eiffel Tower Restaurant is a pretty good example of that. The food here would be in the same price range as some of the most expensive and best restaurants in L.A. Even when comparing Eiffel Tower Restaurant to other pricey Vegas restaurants, Eiffel Tower Restaurant still feels very overpriced. The prices here are similar to Mesa Grill, but the flavors at Mesa Grill are much better (Mesa Grill uses better ingredients too). Eiffel Tower Restaurant makes a great souffle and I would come back for that. The food, however, is overpriced and average (despite having the backing of prominent chef Jean Joho, who also operates the Michelin starred Everest in Chicago). Even though I am not a big fan of Las Vegas restaurants, I think you could do much better on The Strip than Eiffel Tower Restaurant. I walked here, but I imagine they have complimentary valet parking or self-parking like the other big Vegas casinos. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My quest for delicious authentic italian food has hit another brick wall. Definitely no ""gourmet"" at Annies gourmet Italian. I will say I liked the atmosphere and decor inside, but that's about it. We were the only ones in the restaurant for dinner which should probably be a clue. The waitress took a while to come over to us. We both ordered the rigatoni Which came with Caesar salad. We also received a basket of bread but we did not care for it. It seemed stale and just warmed up, not actually baked at the restaurant. The Caesar was pretty good with shaved Parmesan cheese and a couple croutons but nothing special. As far as the rigatoni it was a huge disappointment. It was served In a bowl with just some cheese and sauce on top. The majority was dry rigatoni shells. Both of ours were also cold in the middle. Even after trying to mix the small amount of sauce and cheese all together it was still very dry with hardly any flavor. Annies is also way over priced for the quality of the food. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Mr. M & I had tickets to go see Ron White at The Mirage on 9/2 and since I snagged a coupon from one of those timeshare slickmeisters for a free app at BB King's we thought we'd have dinner here before the show. Now, based on the reviews I didn't have high expectations, but I saw a couple of items on the menu that looked ok so what the heck. We were also slapped with the $5 cover charge by the snotty little hostess. I tell ya what....I know she probably deals with a lot of crap from the public, but she was NOT NICE. I saw on her fancy computer that they also have a $15 cover charge button. For $15 cover the Black Crowes better be on stage and there better be some good secondhand hemp smoke for me to enjoy. Anyway....she said there would be live music. Yeah, 40 minutes later there was a good band that came on stage. A REALLY good band. But seriously we got to hear 4 songs then had to go. My theory started then that the owners of this particular BB King's Club are moneygrubbers. It will be proven as fact later that night. I was really glad the app was free because it was two beef tamales just like the ones you can find in the freezer at Trader Joe's. I like the Trader Joe's grub ok, but one of the tamales had sat too long on one side or something in the steam table and it was hard and would have been better used as a shim under our wobbly table leg. We shared the entree and I'm glad we did because it was a huge amount of food. The pork chop dinner was good all around. Two moist pork chops, perfectly cooked and seasoned with fresh green beans, real mashed potatoes with the red skins still on, and those baked cinnamon apples were all the dessert we needed. We both agreed that meal was really good, but the app was terrible. The steak knife was completely dull. When I first cut into a chop I thought, ""Oh no, this thing is all dried out and tough"", but it was the knife. They need some new ones. Terribly dull. Thank God we didn't really need it. Our server was really nice, but like others have said the service is painfully slow. As I was looking around it seems like the servers have a lot of ground to cover in that joint. It's pretty big, so maybe that adds to the slowness. OK. Take an intermission now. We went to Ron's show which was hysterical. Then Ron invited everyone with a ticket back over to BB King's to listen to his wife sing. Awesome. We got our table and the server was there lickety split to take our drink order. For $8 I got a urine sample sized plastic cup with some mediocre red wine and for $9 my husband got a plastic cup full of ice, water, & a splash of Dewars. I felt like those overpriced drinks were an insult and therefore proved my theory that the owners of this place are moneygrubbers. Those drinks were like someone wasn't even trying. Awful waste of money. The pork chop dinner is 3 stars, and the rest of the evening is a 1. So they get two. I will probably never go back to this joint unless the Black Crowes are there. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Local friends took us here and given the location we were skeptical. As others have commented the service was a bit disorganized. But as an east coast sushi snob the food did not disappoint. We ordered a range of rolls and sashimi offerings (standard stuff, california, spicy maki, tuna) and a noodle dish and all were above average. The bill with beers for 4 was around $100. No one left hungry. Do not be put off by the strip mall location. This is the real deal. By the way I have to wonder about the ""Panda Express"" review. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I never knew green chilies were more valuable than gold. We ordered a dozen red tamales and a dozen green chilies. The person taking our order was not happy that we did not give them a 24 hour notice that their ""gourmet tamales"" require for such a large order. The red tamales were as dry as sawdust and the green chilies came with one small sliver of chili. The ""hot Sauce"" they have is nothing more than enchilada sauce with red chili flake added. Next time I'll just go to Del Taco where two dozen .40 cent tacos do not require a 24 hr notice from a family of 6. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I end up going here when a bunch of people band together for lunch and someone invariably says (without much enthusiasm), ""I guess we could go to Sunroom."" Then we all sigh and sulk upstairs. Every time I hope that something will surprise me, but every time I leave with the same impression. The menu looks like a halfway decent home cook thought he'd start a restaurant and serve the ten things he makes for himself on a Tuesday night or late Sunday morning. Breakfast burrito? Sandwich? Hummus platter? Chili? Nothing that even attempts to raise eyebrows. Beyond that, the preparation, service, and dining room are all rather lackluster. And you're pressed up against a table full of either undergraduate students, grad students, or professors, with no music to drown out their conversations and allow you to have a private conversation of your own. Chipotle is more appealing at this rate (and not much different price-wise). Or just make a sandwich at home, for Pete's sake! I might rate eating a homemade sandwich alone at my desk higher than Sunroom. ",0,1,0,0,0

 First off, had my boyfriend not told me that every topping on the pizza was cold (including the cheese!), I would have never known. They should really have an illuminated sign that advises the customers. I'm sure you have gathered that this pizza is kind of presented exactly like frozen pizza from the store except the bread is cooked. I think the appeal to this place is that it is different - Some people go to restaurants where you can cook your own food because it's different but the fact of the matter is that when I go out to eat, I don't expect to cook it myself and I don't expect it to come half cooked. Had this pizza been cooked, I feel like it would be subpar. The crust was very crispy and the sauce was a standard tomato (no extra hints of basil or pepper). The peperoni reminded me of the peperoni that comes in Lunchables - actually the whole pizza reminded me of a Lunchable (except a pie made of 28 cuts is $35.28 with $.50 per topping a CUT!) To be fair, each cut is $1.30 and you only need 3-4 to really, really be full. They really lay on the toppings - about an inch of cheese, 20 slices of peperoni and a handful of banana peppers for just two cuts with toppings . I feel that you really need to be in the mood for Betos before you go there. When I am in the mood for pizza, I am heading for the flowing, stringy cheese and the flavors melting together before it hits my mouth. I would eat here again if I get the craving - some people in the restaurant had ordered other menu items that looked to be pretty good. I wouldn't take somewhere here as a Pittsburgh Destination though. There is about 10 tables in the restaurant (booths/tables) ... clean/reputable. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We came to BJs this evening for happy hour and we unfortunately had to sit next to an inebriated man. We asked the bartender Scott at what point they stop serving him and the bartender said ""when he's drunk"" and I said ""you don't think he's drunk?"" We got the manager involved as this guy was touching me and making a scene and i felt it was handled very poorly. The manager just made him slide down and kept saying ""I have to slide down for the fat and ugly girl."" This guy was clearly over served and they let him remain at the bar and continued to make a scene. I absolutely will not be back to this location due to the way this situation has been handled.

 I love this place. I have had only a couple poor experiences with food here. One was a veggie burrito, What the hell was I thinking? It blew. Everything else I have had here has been amazing. My personal favorite is the Chicken Quesadilla it is a taste de force. The tacos are all the bomb diggity. They are exactly like street tacos you would get in Mexico or from a taco stand on the streets in Phoenix. Another good thing about this place, unlike other taco stand type places I have patronized, this one has never turned my GI tract into a Wal-Mart the day after thanksgiving. You know, lot's of traffic and little to show for it when the day is done. Another Yelper said that a ""good looking family"" owns Mi Casita. I will translate this for you. He really meant to say ""The family that owns this place has a smoking hot daughter."" I have stared into her eyes many time trying to remember what in the world I came in for.

 We go to Oregano's for two things- Pizza and salads. Tonight, we went for a giant salad and a piece or two of pizza. When our waitress took our order, she said that they were low on romaine lettuce- (the main ingredient of most of their salads) and asked if they could add some spinach. There were 5 of us, and most did not like spinach, so we were very disappointed, and wanted the manager to know. He told us that he made 3 trips to the grocery store that day, and bought them out of romaine lettuce. Then we found out they were not low on romaine, they were out. I don't know how that happens, but it doesn't seem like that's a way to run a restaurant.

 This hotel is getting very dated. Great location and that's about it. Parking in the garage is horrendous. All the way up to the top and no spaces. Plenty reserved for the valet and Hilton Vacation Club though. Once inside you will most likely be accosted every time you walk through the lobby by very aggressive sales people trying to sell you time share rooms. The rooms need a major upgrade. The walls are thin and anything going on in the hallway or 2 or 3 doors down, you can hear every word. Not the best at 2 in the morning. The paint is peeling and the night table and desk drawers are too narrow to hold anything Check in/check out - do the express otherwise you could be waiting on line for 45 minutes. Then of course it's about another 10 minute wait for a very crowded elevator. As with many other reviews, there are plenty of other hotels to select and that would be my recommendation. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I don't mean to be Debbie Downer, because it seems that a lot of people like this place, but I went on Saturday morning while attending the Fire Department's Pancake Breakfast. I stood at the counter (with my 2 1/2 year-old frustratingly fidgeting in his stroller) for a good 15 minutes before someone finally came over-to take the order of the man that had just walked up to the counter right next to me. I almost walked away, but I didn't. A few minutes later the man came back and said, ""Have you been helped?"" ""Nope"" I said, obviously perturbed that he'd waited on the man right next to me first. He took my order and I continued to wait. And wait. Finally, my Iced Latte was ready. You'd think for the length of time I waited that I had ordered some huge complicated drink, but no. I am not sure if they were just understaffed and not expecting the turnout at the breakfast to be so big, but I witnessed no less than two people walk away without being waited on (one woman said, ""I give up"" as she walked away)-or even acknowledged which was the most annoying part. Again, maybe it was stress and being understaffed, but a simple, ""I'll be right with you!"" or ""Sorry for the wait,"" would have been nice. I think that I will get my caffeine fix elsewhere next time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Well this is my first review, so here we go. My wife and I had the chance to try the food from The Tin Kitchen when we stopped by the Noda Brewery on 4/28/12. Apparently, they regularly park at the brewery every other Saturday, and since the brewery offers no food, it makes for a good relationship. They had some special tacos, which included soft shell crab and a steak option along with their standard choices. We both decided to go with the soft shel crab tacos, and I took the red rice as my side while my wife took the pickled veggies. Everything was very fresh tasting and the tacos were made to order, as we saw them preparing the soft shell crabs on the spot. The price was a little more than their regular fare at 13$ for the tacos, but it was well worth it. We will certainly be tracking The Tin Kitchen down again in the future. While they do offer drinks, we were also there for the beer inside the Noda Brewery, but that is for another review. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I am giving the Sheep Camp 3 stars based on the fact that it was a true authentic Buckeye experience. A hole-in-the-wall establishment, looking outdated and forlorn, it was exactly what i would expect (and hoped) to find in downtown Buckeye. Food was very average, but about what i expected. Just wanted to grab some greasy breakfast, and i achieved that. Service was friendly, and i would definitely go back again if i'm in the area and need a cheap place to grab a bite. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Don't go here on a busy day, which is whenever the dbacks or suns play. You will be waiting forever for your food and it will be cold. Then when you complain they blame it on being busy and make you feel like an idiot. The owner sits drinking instead of helping out and basically tells customers to shut up and stop whining! ***Reply to ""owners"" comment**** Jason, Maybe you should get YOUR facts straight before posting a reply. We waited for over 45 minutes for our COLD food to arrive, only after we asked the bartender where our food was. Your manager walked over with our ticket and said "" I see you've been waiting for over 45 minutes for your food"" When we responded that we had never waited that long, she replied "" well we're busy and short-handed"" There was no upfront apology to the fact that our food was late, making us in turn late for the game. Your bartender is not a pleasant person as she would ask what we wanted and not wait for the answer before turning and getting another customer a drink. Unfortunately, we were seated behind one of the beer taps to begin the afternoon and seemed to be forgotten as we sat with empty glasses. We did NOT demand to speak to the owner. He had said hello about 20 min earlier and when the manager came over, my mom asked to speak to the owner. She said he's not working today, and my mom replied,"" I just saw him"", your manager then said "" I'll go get the owner for you."" There was no demanding there. Also please learn to read before posting replies as I stated the owner BASICALLY said to shut up and stop whining. The way he spoke to us is the reason why we would never come back. Also you posted in my mom's review that our food and drinks were comped. We sent the food back as it was cold, so it wasn't comped, and we only had 3 beers between the two of us, the last two were just poured and left undranken. Get your facts straight before coming on here and calling people LIARS.... Maybe if your bartender would have been a little more personable and offered an apology or something in the first place this whole situation would have been remedied. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Was pretty disappointed in the cupcakes and staff. My husband and I went in and bought six different types of their cupcakes. The staff seemed annoyed and burdened by us being in the shop. Even went as far to roll their eyes at us as we ""made"" them wait while we decided which six we wanted. When we got home and tried the cupcakes, we were both very let down. Their buttercream is extremely/sickly sweet. They used the exact same buttercream on all six of the cupcakes and had no identifiable flavors on any of the cupcakes. The cakes themselves were okay, though. A couple were fairly dry. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I feel as though I'm going against the grain here, looking at all the other Yelper's 4 star reviews. And in fact, when I first settled in here for an evening of hardcore tea drinking and Scrabble playing, I had in my mind that it was a pretty nice pub. Well, for a start they have Scrabble. I have already decided I will create a new Yelp list of pubs that have board games. Although not all pubs that have board games have Scrabble it turns out. Anyway, I digress. The fact that The Last Drop has many, many boardgames is a big plus. It's a Wednesday evening, you fancy staying out and maybe having one cheeky drink but also working the grey matter. Perfect. It's also central, in the Grassmarket, and had a nice mix of locals and tourists. I once heard someone comment that only tourists walk down the Royal Mile. I was thinking 'eh? How on earth do you get from A to B then if the Royal Mile is 'tween the two?' And sometimes it can be the same at the Grassmarket. But the Last Drop balances the tourist appeal (have a look for the many, many different currency notes pinned to the ceiling) with still being a good traditional boozer. The food looked quite decent too. Giant pies. That's about all I could see. They've also got loads of hot toddys, irish coffees, hot port and the like. I went for the hot port. It was more like hot ribena, super sweet and didn't really get me buzzed at all. But nice all the same. So, COMPLIMENT SANDWICH TIME. Why only three stars? I hate to say it, I really don't like it when its the service that lets a place down. But here it was. One particular incident of a pot of hot tea being spilled on an arm, and not so much as an apology given. When the customer visibly jumps back, yells (or yelps?!) out in pain and all you say is ""oh, did I spill it on you?"" and then smiles in a dopey manner.... Not cool. Accidents happen, I get that. Usually its me accidentally bumping into other people. But it was the manner of apology, or lack thereof, that riled me up quite a bit. The staff seemed ok, friendly enough, but that particular staff member looked really dopey the whole night and his lack of apology was so rude it kind of put me off a little. I would probably come back here, to play scrabble, and maybe try an Irish Coffee this time. But just wear long sleeves. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I will admit that I am fairly new to sushi so my frame of reference for ""good sushi"" is somewhat limited; however, I do understand freshness and quality and Sushi Creek nails it, consistently. My absolute favorite is the tuna nigiri. Melt-in-your-mouth tender and delicious, a must-try with the snapper a close second. If your a fan of rolls then the Spicy Scallop Roll is a good one to try here. There are plenty of choices for those who don't eat sushi too. Decent burgers, flavorful teriyaki as well as a selection from the daily specials board. Service on weekend days can be a tad slow at times, but the atmosphere is casual and comfortable and you never feel rushed. ",0,0,0,1,0

 So I broke my rule about eating at a restaurant that's totally empty on a Friday night, and shouldn't have. This place is the obligatory 'I guess we have to have a restaurant in our timeshare pitch resort' restaurant. The resort has mouth watering pictures of yummy looking pulled pork sliders all over the place but for some reason they aren't actually on their menu. The place is called Tahiti Joes, Tahiti decor, but only generic food. No coconut shrimp, not even a burger with grilled pineapple on it. Total disconnect between concept and food. The potato skins were clearly freezer stock, overcooked and barely edible. There's a reason why the Denny's below them was packed and Tahiti Joes was empty. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The two stars are for the times that I found something incredible at an incredible price. This place is pretty dumpy and always very crowded. It is pretty far out of my way, so I am usually disappointed when I come home empty handed. Personally, my favorite finds aren't the clothes, but rather, the home goods type things. My favorite finds: A mighty wallet (look it up - so cool) for $1.97, a stand up cardboard cutout of Jacob from Twilight for $1.97, and a ton of brand new (super cute) picture books for $0.44 each. I have gotten plenty of clothes, but it seems like even if there are no holes when I buy it, most of them are made of poor material and fall apart in the wash. If I lived closer, I'd probably go a lot to increase my odds of finding something, but lately it hasn't been worth the drive for me, plus you have to put up with kids and crazy ladies who want that Coach bag in you cart even if it kills them. Dirty, cluttered, unorganized, and a lot of poor quality clothing. Employees are surprisingly friendly. Go if you're in the area, but don't make a special trip. You will most likely come home disappointed. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It pains me to say this.....but I hate this Target. In Happy Gilmore, Chubbs tells Happy to envision his happy place which is a midget on a unicycle and chicks with beer right? Well my happy place is Target. With their addition of Starbucks to the roster, fashionable, wallet friendly clothes and clearance racks galore, Target makes my heart smile. I can go in looking for paper towels yet come out $150 worth of stuff that is too good to pass up. However, anytime I go to this Target, I just get mad and I don't like that. I don't know if it is the skewed parking set up they have (tip park on the first or second level then use the stairs to go to the main level), picked over clothing or the occasional cashier who acts like they are being bothered when you need to check out but I just don't dig it. I would rather drive 15-20 minutes to a Target on the other side of town that go to this one. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This morning, a co-worker and I visited Cupz N' Crepes for a working breakfast. We frequently use the Enterprise Rent-a-Car located a few doors down, and had noticed the cute signage for the new shop. Instead of hitting a Starbucks or Einstein's, we decided to take a peek at this new place. What a treat! I enjoyed a sweet crepe filled with Nutella and bananas and topped with fresh whipped cream. It was delicious! My co-worker had the Nutella, bananas and strawberries - also fabulous. In addition, we had drinks. I had a white mocha and my co-worker had a chai tea. Besides sweet crepes, they also offer savory crepes, salads and bagels. The entire place was comfy and cozy with great seating and free Wi-Fi. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I went to Sportsman's for a networking event last wk & really liked it. We were able to use a section near the door that had cushy seating and oversize chairs. It was a good spot for our group of around 20-30. It's difficult to comment on cost b/c the event was complimentary and we ordered a few plates with fruit, cheeses, meats and olives that were perfect with the wines. They even had a wine tasting area in the rear of the store that was a nice feature I haven't seen at the other local wine bars. Service was great and I had no complaints there. ",0,0,0,1,0

 It is pretty rare that an overall Yelp rating is actually spot on for a restaurant but this place is a definite rarity in itself. The ordering system is a bit confusing for a Which Wich virgin but once you get the hang out it it all makes sense. Sadly, the customer service aspect has been taken out of the equation because of the ordering which makes it seem a bit robotic. The option to have combos with a milkshake is a pretty cool touch and my buddy said his banana/chocolate milkshake was delicious. Any place where you can customize your options to your exact specifications makes me happy in the pants. 3.5 stars for you Which Wich. Your name on the other hand.....10 stars! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Review of theatre only. We were there to see comedian Ron White. Will call worked good I will say, I was able to pick up my tickets at the MGM Grand. I did like that we were easily able to find the theatre watching posted signage on the 1/2 mile traipse from the lot thru the clubs, the lobby, the casino, the restaraunts, the shops, the clubs, more shops..... Lobby experience - meh. Concessions - soft drinks are ridiculous, served in a little plastic cup, no lid, $5. Popcorn had a ton o salt dumped on it. We were seated front far left. These were not good seats (even tho premium priced), since the rows are not staggered in height down there. Hard to see Ron. The seats themselves were barely ok, not up to par with modern movie theatres. Most shocking, the sound was dreadful, could barely hear Ron. I missed several jokes straining to hear. So - ya, one star, theatre sucked (I was going to go 2 star, then realized there wasnt a thing I liked about it) ",1,0,0,0,0

 I had really high hopes for this place. The menu looked very good. However I must admit charging for chips and salsa is such a no-no. I have never been to a Mexican restaurant that charges for chips and salsa!!! This would be the first of many complaints for the meal. Bryan ordered a beer I ordered my standard water. For our app we ordered pazole to share and they were out on it so we went with the xochitl soup. It was ok. Nothing spectacular. Then we waited for food and drinks. I asked if they had horchata and they do!! It was ok. It had a weird aftertaste though. I ordered the Chiles Tehuacan which was sweeter then I thought it was going to be but not to bad. The rice was a bit Under cooked as well. Bryan got fajitas and he liked the fresh tortillas. The staff here just seamed like they had no idea what they were doing. It took forever for drinks and food and for empty plates to be taken away. It was just bad. For dessert we had fried ice cream which was actually the stand out for me. It was perfect. Also the prices were really high. When it was time to pay the check our waiter charged Bryans card to someone else's bill. We noticed it and he fixes it but service just seamed a mess. Alas I was let down. I won't be returning. The prices are to high the service was unorganized and the food was just average. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Probably my mother's favorite place for siu laap! Since she lives in Glendale, I'm often asked to be the delivery gal to bring her roasted duck, boiled chicken with the head still on, and roasted pork whenever she needs to do some Chinese ceremonial tradition. If it's not me she's forcing to do the grunt work, it's one of her co-workers. Regardless, even if it's on the east side, it will always show up to Mommy W. fresh! I first came across this place when my friend invited us out for dinner. It seemed to have all your Americanized and authentic foods. Service can be a bit of a wait but it's definitely worth your time. Kudos to the chef for making such amazing flavorful food. Prices are reasonable and the place is clean. I haven't tried any of their lunch specials but my friend says they're pretty decent. They make a delicious Mussels with Black Bean Sauce and their Salt & Pepper Shrimp is pretty amazing as well. And there's nothing like some rice soup [aka porridge] when you want something warm. It's the Asian chicken noodle soup [comfort food]. I stick with either the pork with the century egg or the fish fillet porridge. Momma W. makes it best but Best Hong Kong Dining is a close second. The only reason why I don't frequent here as often as I should is because parking is always a pain. There are some other eateries and a grocery store in this strip plaza so parking can be pretty sketchy. You know us Asian drivers. Look out! :P ",0,0,0,1,0

 Stopped here the other day for lunch. Parked in the covered parking area that is available for retail (131 Main, East Blvd Grill, Yn, etc). There's a entrance from the garage, so I walked in through there. First impression was that is lacked ambiance and the colors (gray) were a little off. Seemed like they were trying to go modern, but missed. Anyway, sat at the bar and grabbed a menu. Bartender was very nice. I noticed a person sitting next to me had a huge sandwich on his plate, so I politely asked what it was...he said it was the Chicken Philly. Not in the mood for chicken, but on the menu underneath the Chicken Philly was the regular Philly Cheesesteak that came with slices of ribeye, onions and provolone cheese...all on a hoagie roll...sold. It was also advertised as the ""Big Guy"", so based on the plate of the person next to me, I was pumped. Waited 5 minutes and the fun imagination was turned into disappointing reality. The sliced ribeye was more like little chucks of grizzle that gave the impression of being re-heated. It didn't even fill up the hoagie roll...must have been the saddest looking ribeye pre-sammy. Very little cheese was melted underneath the steak and the hoagie wasn't even toasted (can't remember if it was suppose to be, but it would have helped). This is the first time I've eaten a philly cheesesteak and been able to turn the sandwich into a roll because of the lack of meat (picture a wrap). Flavor was ok, but I've tasted better. On a positive note, the home fires were good and I enjoyed them. I recommend they beef up their cheesesteak or else change the menu description, as it was not a ""big guy"". ",0,1,0,0,0

 As a Louisiana native, I love crawfish. So when I wanted to try out this place, I wasn't expecting some awesome crawfish in Las Vegas. When we got there, the place was packed and a crazy line out the door, so I thought it may have decent crawfish so I decided to wait 45 mins to get seated. Anyway, once we got in there, the menu confused me because there were a million different flavors of crawfish to choose from, which is unlike anything I've ever seen; the most flavor you usually choose from in the south is if you want them extra spicy or not. There were 3 of us, so we got a few pounds of crawfish to try out, of different flavors to start, we also got fried catfish, and an order of crab legs. The crawfish were surprisingly pretty tasty! But the catfish didn't taste very good at all, and the crab legs were okay, but extremely overpriced and not for a good reason. Anyway, if I'm craving crawfish again in Vegas, and have time to wait for a seat, I'd go back but I'd only order the crawfish and nothing else. ",0,0,1,0,0

I ordered the steak & brat sandwich with an order of Wisconsin Cheese Curds -$27!!! Absurd.

 Lidia, you should be ashamed! This spot wouldn't have lasted a year in NYC. Citizens of Pittsburgh, don't be fooled. Lidia's is average at best. I ate here when it opened,a and again 4 years later. Nothing has changed. We did have some great bar nibbles, quality cocktails, and a good bottle of wine off of a pretty good list, but the food and service lacked. For starters we were served ice cold meatballs and limp soggy salads. The took away everything and only brought back fresh salads (mind you, we were one of about 10 tables being served that evening!). The entrees were dull and lacked seasoning. The servers were confused (how many times does it take to ask fro fresh pepper?) and our waiter seemed to hand off our table to another server. It's tough to find anything good here.

 A fitting embodiment of It Is What It Is. I've been twice, in 1991 and again in 2005. From what I can remember, it hadn't changed at all between then. Smoky in the bar area, though another review tells me that's old news now. I wasn't 21 for either of those visits, but I can imagine sitting at the bar for a couple of hours around lunch would give me the full experience were I to do it now. Food-wise, nothing spectacular with the enchiladas I ordered the last time. But the beauty of El Charro is that it doesn't advertise itself as the best of the best, just a fixture at that location and a reputable spot to grab a drink or some acceptable Mexican food if you're in the area. I'm sure if I find myself near that part of town again some afternoon I'll stop in again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 First, of course Ulta is a chain. That being said, you really have to know what you are doing. I have their ""club card"" and I will only shop if I have a coupon. You also have to know how their prices compare to others or you get totally screwed. Browsing is the worst for me. I have a weakness in my cynical armor when it comes to beauty supplies. I BELIEVE the box. I really think that this or that will make me fun, flirty, sexy or thinner. I spend copious amounts of money on a whim, or preparation for a date, only to fail at the last minute and end up doing the same thing I do every day. My failings aside, you really do need to know what you want when you go in. Apparently every Ulta is short staffed, but this location seems to really suffer. I don't think I've ever been offered help, except at the checkout counter. I know they do makeovers there, and make up tryouts, but I've never seen anyone actually doing it, or been consulted about any product. It's hard to even find someone to answer a question. However, they do have products I can't find most places, just price check against Sallys and other stores. ",0,0,1,0,0

 How is the food here? Couldn't tell you. How are the drinks? Wouldn't have the slightest clue. The ladies? Didn't really pay attention, they have places called Gentlemen's clubs for that. So why the one star? Well, I reached out to this establishment about a week ahead of time to see if they would be playing a boxing match. Not a PPV match by the way, but just a match on ShowTime. They replied yes and bring your friends. So I did and I came, luckily I arrived first, and as we were being seated I specified we were there for the fight, to get a good view. They stated they would not be playing the fight. I explained my confusion because of my interaction on Facebook. I don't know what made more upset my embarrassment from having to redirect my friends or the nonchalant attitude of the manager about the whole situation. She simply could have cared less. I posted a screenshot from the interaction on facebook in the pics section in case there was any doubt (the manager on duty seemed to doubt me for whatever reason). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twin-peaks-phoenix-2?select=qHhaQGOx05ClrIYB3y0pVA#qHhaQGOx05ClrIYB3y0pVA With all that said, I did not eat there, but I did look at the menu online and if you are in this area I would suggest going around the corner to Half Moon.

 My husband and I travel to Vegas once a year to see family, enjoy the sites and gorge on some really great food. My mother-in-law heard about Pasta Mia, located across from the Palms Hotel, and wanted to check it out. We were all game. Man - was that a great decision. There's a huge sign that states that a free bottle of house wine will be offered for parties of 4 or more. Sweet! And we were attended to by Liz and some of her colleages and they were attentive without being over bearing. We didn't have appetizers to start because given that we were visiting, we all were expecting to eat our entire dinner portion (no where to take leftovers). So I don't have any comments to share on the appetizers but the garlic bread was SO GOOD. Again, so good. Salad with the homemade dressing was a hit and I was the only one that opted for soup with my meal and that was nice and tasy as well. When the portions come out, you'll be blown away. Huge portions - definitely enough to share. My husband had the chicken pesto fettucine, I had the chicken and mushroom pasta (yum) and I can't remember what everyone else had. But everyone was happy as a clam at the end of the meal. The sauces are very creamy and rich but extremely delicious. Definitely not diet fare. For all that Vegas has to offer in terms of food and restaurant options, I feel like we found a gem located in a strip mall. Will be dining there again for sure. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I love Forever 21 just not their stores. Service: 1/5 The service is okay here no ones stands out that are helpful.The dressing rooms are over packed, unorganized and slow. Once I had a bag of items I DID want but since your only allowed to bring 6 items with you in the dressing room I had to leave the items I DID WANT outside. There must've been miscommunication or a misplacement because my bag with the items I DID WANT miraculously DISAPPEARED & I was super annoyed I had to go look for those same items again. Store: 2/5 The store is huge like a department store and I hate department stores. There's so much clothes the selection is way too huge. You'll just end up walking in circles. I never thought I could say this.. too much can be a bad thing. Clothing: 2/5 You get what you pay for. Their clothing is cheaply made and the quality sticks. Shrunk cloths is a given, I always shop for a size bigger than myself in tops because my tops always end up shrinking SO ANNOYING. I'm a small but I always buy mediums. ONLINE: 5/5 BUT like I said I LOVE FOREVER 21...so if your looking for an organized selection check out their website. Its a lot better than their stores. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Dish specializes in Southern \ \ comfort foods with a ""quirky"" twist. Unfortunately, the quality of the food varies widely. My theory is that if the owner is there, the food's top-notch. But if she's not there, the kitchen slacks off in a really bad way. I've had the chicken & dumplings and thought it was great. I've had it other times and it was borderline awful. The Cajun meatloaf & mashed potatoes can be sublime; or the meatloaf can be greasy and the potatoes lumpy. The shrimp & grits can be absolutely delicious... but it can be nearly tasteless, too. The staff is usually pretty good, and are especially patient with our table (usually tables of 8 or 10), but they can have bad days, too. It's gotten to where I don't want to gamble on Dish when Midwood Smokehouse and The DIamond are in the same neighborhood, and are far more consistent. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Food is alright, nothing I would crave and be inspired to go back for. The home made chips are pretty good- fried, salty potatoes. I don't mind an eclectic environment in a restaurant but it was all a little too cheesy for me. It seems like they printed out scanned copies of magazine covers from the 60's all on the same sized paper. Its like its supposed to be erratic, but all the papers are pale and pretty much lined up. I don't know, I feel like they could have actually posted old memorabilia if they were trying to create that 60's feel. Instead, it feels like a restaurant in 2013 trying to tape up pictures they printed at home about the 60's. The games and books on the table are fun, but it wasn't enough to make it become a regular place for me. The servers were really sweet though, great attitudes. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Normally, I love Casa Don Juan. The pollo endiablo (spelling definitely wrong there) is delish, and homemade tortillas? To die for. Did I mention the make fried ice cream with Fruity Pebbles? SO GOOD! I've been here twice before and had a wonderful experience each time with great service - today was almost bad enough to make me not want to return. The waiter was exceptionally bad. First, my friend tried to order a side of soup; apparently the sides of soup aren't sold on Sundays, okay, that's weird but whatever, she adjusted. Her salad came a good 15 minutes before my chicken, so she was nearly finished by the time I barely started. We went to order our favorite, the fried ice cream. We were kept waiting for about 10 minutes after ordering and then the waiter came back to tell us that there was no fried ice cream today because the ice cream was too soft. Um, you can't stick that in the freezer? His reply was chilling (even if the ice cream wasn't) : ""The freezers aren't strong enough to freeze ice cream."" WHAT? While I was screaming to get out of there and questioning where my meat was kept, if not in this subpar freezer, my friend asked him to recommend an alternate dessert. His response: ""I don't really like the food here. I like Puerto Rican food better so I don't really eat here. The sopapillas look kinda good."" We ended up giving up on getting anything sweet from there and just flat out left. The waiter didn't charge us for my friend's salad, which was appreciated considering 2/3 of our orders were rejected, but my advice to that waiter - if you don't like the food at the restaurant, at least have one or two recommendations that you can somewhat stomach! Sometimes honesty isn't the best policy. Still deciding if we'll be back... that fried ice cream is pretty magical. But I think I want proof the freezer works, first. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This place doesn't make any promises about being glamorous. What it does promise is a clean room at a low price. They have rates as low as $30 a night during the week and $50 on the weekends. I wouldn't quite call it a Casino, I think the title Gambling Hall fits it well. There are probably 3-4 dozen slot machines. They had one of two roulette tables running and two of three blackjack tables going. There was also this mini craps table that made me chuckle. One half of the bar is a sports book of sorts. The table limits were pretty low. I think they had $5 and $3 black jack, and the roulette was $2. Since the craps wasn't being played, they didn't have a placard, so I'm not sure what limit that was. Some of the 'nice' casinos cover up the smoke smell with scents that are sometimes more nauseating than stale cigarettes, but not at the Triple W. They don't try to hide the smoke smell. The hotel is used a lot by truckers since there's a truck lot right next door. So it'll be truckers and chain smoking locals pushing the Max-Bet button on the slots when you check in. I wasn't coughing when I walked in, they kept the air clean, but it definitely smelled like my mother's home-office in the basement after she finished working on the months payroll. So when you check in, don't wear the clothes you plan to have on when you go out that night. Speaking of going out, it's a very short drive to the Strip (about half of a mile) or a brisk walk, if that's your thing. The parking at the Excalibur is free which is something I'm sure you're looking for if you're the type who plans on staying at the WWW. The location of this place is great. It's right off the Interstate and is less than a mile from the corner of Trop. Ave and the Strip (Where MGM Grand, Excalibur, NY/NY, and the Tropicana are). For as sketchy as the Casino err.. I mean 'Gambling Hall' was, I didn't feel unsafe, and the room was quite nice. I've been in plenty of nicer hotels in my day that had musty ash-tray smelling non-smoking rooms. Not only did our room not even have a hint of cigarette stink, it was clean, the bathroom had hot water (My friends staying at the Excalibur didn't) and it had all the towels and hotel shampoo we needed. There was even a pool, but it was too cold for us to use it. All in all, we were quite pleased with the place. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This was a disaster. About the toughest, worst steak I've had. Ever. When we made reservations, they tried to lure us with a fixed price menu of: salad, filet, and dessert for $55. This was their idea, not ours. When we arrived, they said that was not available. After our waiter conferences with the chef, the manager, and several other people who met in hushed tones in the back and then asked us who exactly was it that told us that a fixed price was available, they offered us a salad, a strip steak, and two pieces of ravioli each. Given that this is a steakhouse, I was very underwhelmed. I think they justified our ""special accomodation"" by giving us the oldest, chewiest piece of steak they had. Neither myself or my dining parter could finish the steak. Frankly, it hurt my jaw. It was unacceptable steak at any price. ",1,0,0,0,0

 A friend made reservations here for his birthday - for four of us. We were driving into Vegas from LA and were going to be a little tight on time for getting in, getting ready, etc. We called the restaurant, and they very nicely bumped our reservation back an hour for us. The Blue Ribbon is located in the new Cosmopolitan, which is GORGEOUS... The sights walking up to the restaurant were phenomenal. It did take us a little bit to find it, so give yourself at least 10 minutes to get from the front door to the restaurant. The restaurant is large. There is a bar in the front for cocktails, then tables and the sushi bar in the center, booths along one side. We were led all of the way to a back room in the back corner. It made for a very private feeling which was great in a bustling restaurant. Bonus points for us actually being able to hold a conversation. Had we not been seated in the corner, it would have been frustrating to talk to each other. We decided to go with the Chef's Tasting. I don't believe it is on the menu, but we paid $100 per person. Two large plates came out. The first held only sashimi, four of each kind, and the second came with nigiri. This is clearly the type of place that prefers quality over quantity. While they appeared to be two large plates, I was still a little hungry at the end. Not everyone eats everything, so I was a little bummerface. I wouldn't say that I'm entirely picky, but had I known then what I know now, I probably would have ordered something separate in addition for myself. The quality was on point. The fish was fresh, and the flavors dazzled. The seaweed salad is certainly a must. We ordered two for the four of us. I'd absolutely recommend it for special occasions, at least once. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I visited in August 2011, and enjoyed it, although it's fairly limited in scope. The dolphins were active, although it was obviously a fairly small space for them compared to dedicated marine parks. They seemed healthy and active, and the underwater viewing port was great. There was a baby dolphin swimming in circles with its mother. There are no tricks or shows, just the animals behaving in a fairly natural way. The cats were all quite lazy and sleeping (it was mid-day and very hot, so this was to be expected), but seemed to be healthy and doing ok. They also had fairly small enclosures -- not small cages, but certainly not enough space to run or exhibit full range of feline behavior. I really don't think this exhibit would have existed on its own as it is, but it's a good way to continue to maintain the animals after the shows have ended. The best deal is to get the 3 attractions (out of 8) for ~$50 pass. Some of the other tickets are $28 each. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Teppanyaki is not really my favorite style of cooking. I always feel it's a little over priced because the food itself is pretty boring but you are paying more money since the chef puts on a show for you. It can be a fun experience if you are with the right people and in the mood for it but I have never really been wowed by a meal at one of these places. Our last experience at a teppanyaki place up in Flagstaff was so awful that I was not really looking forward to our dinner at Benihana but we had received a gift card for Christmas so we decided to go ahead and give them a try. Style wise, the place is on par with the other restaurants around Chandler mall. Nice looking but somewhat trite Asian decor. Not surprisingly, they were quite busy on a Saturday night and we had to wait at the bar a little while for a table. While we were sitting there, I observed that there were a surprisingly amount of families there. I would have thought that this was not type of place you would bring kids, partially because of the hibachi grill and also the price. But there were a ton of kids of all ages. Most of the families were on their way out, though, and the late night crowd was arriving. This seems to be a popular date spot for college age couples. There was a good lively crowd in the bar area so we didn't really get a whole lot of attention from the bartender... they definitely need to staff up behind the bar. Since I found the wine and beer list very lacking, I decided to try a couple of their specialty cocktails. These were mediocre at best. The Cucumber Collins had a good, fresh flavor to it and was pretty enjoyable but it could have done with a little more lemon and less club soda. I decided to switch to something stronger and so made the mistake of ordering a Beni-Tini. This drink was overly sweet and not enjoyable at all. I could not detect any hibiscus flavor so I have to assume that they use a syrup rather than brewed tea. If you like sweet drinks this may work for you but I guess I should have just ordered a regular martini. I did notice they had some top shelf (well, mid-shelf anyway) liquor bottles so next time I'll just stick to the basics. Once we were finally seated, my hubby and I had no complaints about our chef or the food. The mushroom soup was tasty, though it took me by surprise since most restaurants like this serve Miso Soup as a starter. I also really enjoyed the salad; it had plenty of other vegetables, not just lettuce, and the dressing was really good. The hubby got a surf and turf thing with steak and jumbo shrimp. I tried one of his shrimp and they were very sweet and delicious, much better than the smaller ones we all got included with our meals. (Those were cooked well, but just inferior quality shrimp). For my entree, I ordered a noodle dish, Seafood Diablo. This was not as spicy as I was hoping and the sauce was a bit too greasy for me (lots of oil on my plate when I was done) but overall it was good. The seafood all tasted delicious and I was actually amazed that chef managed to make sure that the squid, shrimp, etc in my dish didn't get overcooked while at the same time tending to everyone else's chicken and steak. We ended the meal with the fried banana dessert with vanilla ice cream and a scoop of chocolate on the side for me. We were both pretty happy with that! Overall, this is not the best teppanyaki place I've been to but it is far from the worst. I would probably eat here again if I was with a group who picked it but I wouldn't necessarily suggest it myself. ",0,0,1,0,0

 First, on a personal note, I can't eat a lot in one sitting, so all-you-can-eat places generally aren't for people like me. $65 to eat an amount of food I could get for a third of the price doesn't make sense to me. If you can eat $65 worth of meat, by all means, come here. I was pleased with the meats. All were prepared well, and the flavor was amazing. I got to have leg of lamb, lamb chops, various steaks, and some pork loin. All were satisfying and tasty. My problem is with two things: value for the dollar, and soft drinks. The website for the establishment says all beverages and desserts are extra. Fine. But for $65 a head, I think I should be able to have a bottomless beverage, not $4 for each 12 oz can of ginger ale. This is America. Get with the program. Bottomless beverages are expected in this country. Install a fountain. I got to try a bite of the key lime pie, and it was no better than a slice of Edward's frozen key lime pie that you can get in any grocery store. Why do I mention this? Because a single slice of key lime pie here is $8.50. I can get the whole pie and a can of whipped cream for that and still have change left over. I am a frugal person, and I believe this place lacks a few amenities that its price tag would usually indicate. I probably won't be back any time soon. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Went during a weekday and the food was mediocre. The two stars are only due to its presentation, which was excellent. Our waitress was one of the best - took care of us, explained the divisions of buffet areas, and she took the initiative to bring us water WITH our regular drinks. Our table was never cluttered with plates because as soon as we left and came back, they were gone. The food came preportioned already, which is a great idea to limit waste at a buffet and the shrimp was already peeled and placed in a small plate for us with a dollop of cocktail sauce. So cute! The lack of three stars is due to the actual food :( Unfortunately the food was not good. It was bland and dry. The desserts weren't even that great except for the ice cream/gelato. The pasta, though it was preportioned, was left out in little bits only to dry because of the heat lamps :( Most of the food tasted burnt and overcooked. The cosmo was definitely a place to visit and sight see but not to eat. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was lured in by a sample of youngberry tea, so refreshing and I wanted some more. The sales woman gave me a sample of all the teas they had brewed and a tour around the shop. She was friendly and knowledgeable about the products in the store - a pleasure to speak with. When it came time to buy she did her very best to sell me every tea product in the store. I stayed the course though and insisted I only wanted some tea. She grabbed a large canister and started filling it up with tea and I had to stop her and explain there was no way I needed that much tea. She then grabbed a smaller canister and started filling it up, even the small canister seemed like it would last me a year. She put it on the scale and it rang up to $50.... for Tea. Again, I stopped her and told her that was way too much to spend on tea and she removed the tea from the canister and put some into paper bag. It really bothered me that she had taken the liberty to fill up that first large canister of tea, who knows what that would have cost. The Teavana staff must know their products are expensive and I would have preferred it if she would have asked me beforehand how much tea I needed or how much I wanted to spend, seeing as how there weren't prices on tea, or at least none that I could see. I understand that they are trying to make money and up sell but ASK, don't take liberties. ",0,0,1,0,0

 My husband and I love new restaurants that focus on local ingredients so we were super excited for a month to try this place for our anniversary. What a let down. It was so noisy we could not relax and enjoy our drinks or hear the specials from our server. Our salads were okay. Our main courses were very salty; I at least was able to scrape the skin off my fish to enjoy the flavor, only to discover the overpowering butter underneath. My husband's steak was cooked well but again was very salty. My husband thought his green beans were drowning in schezuan sauce but felt too embarrassed to send them back. We asked for our meals to be boxed up halfway through, hoping dessert would show more potential. It didn't. But just when we were about to leave and go somewhere else for dessert we were served a delicious brownie and coffee. That's the reason I gave it two stars. Overall if you are looking for an interesting place for drinks, apps, and a view this might be good. But if you are looking for an intimate dinner I would go somewhere else. ",0,1,0,0,0

 What a joke. I ordered a Groupon for two night with upgraded room option INCLUDED. Two days after check out my credit card was charged a $89 dollar upgrade fee. I called to inquire about the fee and they said they would reverse the charge. Never happened. I had to call my credit card company and contest the charges.

 We have used Bob's K9 Convenience twice now. The big news here is that Bob and his team have come BACK the second time! You see, we have FOUR dogs. They are a handful! Bob took meticulous notes in our first meeting prior to the visit. He asked great questions and anticipated our requests and the dogs' needs. We even have one dog who doesn't easily warm up to strangers but he did fine. We've never experienced a service coming into our home while we were gone but this service was very trustworthy. The extra touch of giving us regular reports (emails) was especially reassuring. We added one other request. We feed a feral cat who lives in the neighborhood and Bob's service did not hesitate to tend to the cat's feeding and watering as well. Bob's friendly demeanor is especially appreciated. Well done, Bob! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Service was outstanding. My waiter, Stew, was super attentive and friendly too. Whenever an employee went by me, they would check on me. I had the chicken fajitas that were on special. Hot, fresh and tasted great. I asked for them to be extra spicy, and I received a small side dish with a fresh jalape \ u00f1o sliced for me. No stinky pickled peppers here. I sat on their ""outside patio"", which overlooks the rainforest, waterfall area. I enjoyed my experience. I'll be back. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This used to be in Tivoli but has been moved over to Sunset Park. I did not attend the previous location, just this year but I've been to other Motley Brews organized events. The park has one lane in and out into the parking lots. The closest parking lot was a clusterfuck to get into and had a long queue causing traffic so we parked elsewhere and walked around the park to get down to the area. The usual suspects are the line up. I usually go purely to those pouring out of taps and not bottles then narrow down to mostly seasonals or specialty brews like Joseph James does exclusively for festivals. Since this was a Spring/Summer fest, there is a strong show of lighter, fresher styles and IPA heavy. I'm glad craft beer and events are gaining popularity. Events I go to annually are much busier now than they ever been. With that though, I feel they should make sure the space is far more than adequate. Sunset Park is a large park and they used part of the lake as a barrier, and then put up fencing around the festival space. We were not encroaching on the regular park goers space at all, so I feel that could have made the space bigger. If this was held maybe a month ago, it would have been perfect weather. It was a hot sunny day and that with drinking is crappy enough. Trying to distinguish where long lines ended and where crowds hanging out begins sucked. Trying to squeeze through people to get places sucked. One big thing for me is that I like to be able to throw away remnants of my brew, wash it out well before getting a new beer. I noticed some vendors had their own thing behind the bar to do that, some didn't and just dumped the beer in the grass. This is not well prepared at all and was a complaint before in a review 2 years ago, so not a newcomers mistake. I would use my own water bottle to rinse except you know, I actually need to have a lot of water because it is hot and I always hydrate so I don't end up as a sick and sorry as the day progresses. This fest did not provide free waters I could fine (maybe there was and I'm wrong) , there were food vendors with beverages though. I found sporadically a table with a cooler and a dump bucket, but really it was so hard to jump through the crowd to get to the next area, I can't keep going back and forth to the 2 tables I've found in the park grounds to rinse and then push through again. The combination of being hot, having to touch and get really near people when I'm already feeling sticky and icky, cant find a rinse station, can't find shade, no water made us over it pretty fast. I'm very thankful I got free tickets, but I'm also highly relieved I didn't waste money for this. With it growing in popularity and is in the 3rd annual state, I feel it should have been more thought out and improved each year. I hate leaving bad reviews, I love supporting craft beer things, but this simply was not pleasant. I didn't know if I should put A-OK 3 stars or a 2 star... but after 2 hours I was done and left to get ice cream in frustration. Maybe A-OK for you, but was not for me. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My girlfriend and I decided to check out Squash Blossom for breakfast because its within walking distance of her apartment. When first approaching, we couldn't really tell where the entrance was. We entered through what looked like the back patio and were immediately confused because no one greeted us right away. There was no hostess stand. Only what looked like a refill station where servers get glasses, and had a bucket and rag just sitting there. The service was ok. Our waitress was fine, but I found myself distracted by the conversations of servers who weren't busy, just hanging out sitting at the bar (there was only one other couple in the entire place). As far as the food goes, there was nothing special about it. I got the veggie scramble which came with hashed browns and wheat toast and my girlfriend got the biscuits and gravy with sausage and hashed browns. First off, nothing tasted like it was seasoned, and both of our hashed browns were really mushy. My veggie scramble was ok, but there was no crunch or texture with the potatoes or other veggies. My toast just seemed like normal, store packaged bread. The biscuits and gravy was probably the best thing we were served, but it looked as though they out that all on the plate right away and let it sit while all the other food was being cooked. The sausage that came with the biscuits was interesting, but the presence of, I believe, fennel was pretty strong. Both dishes came with a tiny pumpkin flavored muffin that was pretty good. I noticed that pumpkin pancakes are the first thing on their menu, which leads me to believe that's probably their specialty. If I go back, I'll probably try the pancakes. I give Squash Blossom two stars because I've had worse experiences. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Worst Discount Tire Experience!!! My wife and I went to this location as our local Discount Tire shop did not have the tires in stock. We were assisted (if you want to call it that) by Kenny who had the most dry sense of humor ever. I explained to him my situation and why I was there and he appeared to be annoyed as he couldn't find my info and if I was sure that I bought them at Discount. I clearly had my paperwork and finally when he was able to retrieve my info, we got to why I was at this location. I then proceeded to ask if there were any tire deals that he was aware of and he said in a condescending way that he wasn't aware of any and I mentioned to him that my local store said there were some available. Once he looked up and found the rebate, we got down to the numbers. I asked him if they still had the 0 interest deals and again at this point he was more annoyed and looked up my info and made a call and did nothing to help. I finally had enough and advised that his attitude was inappropriate and that customers should not be treated that way. I also advised that I am in sales and that I was surprise he was in a position where he had to interact with customers and he then made a comment that if it was about money that he couldn't do anything about it. I felt humiliated and shocked that someone would say that. I asked to get his manager and he said he was one of them which shocked me even more. All in all, this was not the way I planned on spending my birthday present from my wife and hope that others that read this review will reconsider going to this location. If Kenny is a manager then I must be a doctor with zero experience!!!!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 This was a big disappointment. Of course we had heard and read about all the hoopla and fan-fare. Finally, got to try it. While things started well enough with the two starters we ordered, the mains were big disappointments, Style over substance, both figuratively (it looked better than it tasted) and literally (there were only *3* scallops for a $29 plate... that's almost $10/scallop!). Even more disconcerting, as there is an open kitchen, we had observed our scallops-order sitting for abut 7-8 minutes while they caught up with our steak order. When they delivered it, the scallops were cold. We told the waitress. The waitress said, ""Let me take care of this - they will cook you a new one."" We saw her tell the chef, and he looked angry. Then, as we observed, the chef only warmed up the two scallops in an oven and then slapped it back on the plate! That's not re-cooking, that's re-heating--Applebee's style! Not what you would expect from a restaurant that is this hyped... the pretentiousness, observed when you watch the kitchen, unfortunately shows up in ugly ways on the plate. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Oh, San Felipe's you sure did luck out by being right next to the stage at Tempe Marketplace. Showed up at 7 on a Sat. Yep, I just missed their happy hour. They weren't very crowded. Short line at the door for checking ID's. Have to wear a bracelet for 21+. ""Wait to be seated"". So we wait, & then wait some more. The 2 girls lackadaisically wiping down menus don't say anything. We finally ask about the lack of a server & they finally want to put our name on a list. Gee thanks! We sit at the bar & order drinks. Bam! The table we wanted on the patio is available. Yay! We sit & wait. Wait. Wait. Server! Oh, this is the same girl who served us last time we were here. Ok, basically you do a lot of waiting at this place. *sigh* Pathetic. It took FOREVER for my quesadilla to come. $4.95 for a small. Add $2 for chicken or steak & $3 for shrimp. It was decent. They didn't skimp on the chicken at least. The heaters came on a little too soon. Got a little warm. Temp dropped & it became perfect. Heaters go off & stay off. Umm OK :( There was no guy holding the men's restroom door open this time. I was so relieved, you have no idea. So, why 3 stars this time? Free chips & bomb ass salsa. It's chunky & perfectly spicy with black eyed peas & corn. I want some in a bottle for my house please!

 I am going to defer to the review of Melissa Y, who says it all: What is the big fuss? And Why is this place still open? As many who have read my reviews know, my wife is Korean, and we are picky about our Korean BBQ. This place is not worth the time and trouble to cross the street and park here. The quality is really poor, the place is dirty, and they seem to have an attitude. I could say more negetive things, but it would be pointless. Drive further down Spring Mountain, and give Korean Garden BBQ a try. Much better quality, better service, and oh, it's very clean. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Honestly i had more fun at the Playboy Club next door. For some reason, it's the same idea - putting a club on the top floors of a tower - but doesn't execute the same way. I danced more when i was at the Playboy Club - but maybe that's because i prepartied at Ghostbar. Who knows.

 greetings fellow lovers of food. it was balmy Wednesday evening. it had been raining for 4 days, but it was a warm rain thank god. the misses and I both had a rare evening free from responsibility, that cruel mistress. I was wearing a one of a kind brewery sweatshirt that fit me a little too snugly. she, heaven. I had been staying up too late for a few nights on my projects. needed a shave and I needed a good drink like Sammy makes, only at the sardine. a local hideaway with a dependable kitchen, fostering much of the criminal element in this Gothic sprawl i call home. Madison. writing the word is like an old lovers name on parched lips; it leaves a sting, but sweetly. the food was excellent, the company more than. the drinks made me feel young again, and the staff treated us like kings and queens and family all around.

 I used to think Rachel's Kitchen was more like Sandy's Dining Room and would often bring out-of-towners here for a casual lunch when they asked for a little ""local flavor."" I've always had a pleasant experience here until recently when I brought my mom, and ended up leaving with my tail between my legs because I was so embarrassed I'd hyped it up for her and then let her down! My mom decided to order for us - she wanted the Ultimate Grilled Cheese with a mixed green salad, and I wanted 1/2 440 Sandwich with soup. While ordering mine, the cashier asked what side she wanted, so she said sweet potato fries. The cashier handed my mom a number and we sat at our table, chatting and waiting. And waiting. And waiting. Friends, couples, and colleagues came, ate, and went while we sat at our table, with my mom commenting that this was probably not a good place for a work lunch. While we sat there, one of the runners came out and told us the 440 does not come on ciabatta bread like I'd wanted, so I opted for wheat - couldn't they have told us this while we were ordering and not 10-15 minutes later? The food finally came out and instead of sweet potato fries, we had limp French fries on my plate with no soup. We called a runner to explain and he promptly brought out an extra serving of sweet potato fries without taking my plate back - kudos for not having to make us wait even longer. When we inquired about the soup, however, another employee kept asking us for our number that we no longer remembered. She was finally able to pull up our check and said that I had ordered the 1/2 sandwich with a side - I didn't even know that was an option on the menu, especially since my mom had only asked for the sweet potato fries because she'd been prompted. It was like Seinfeld's ""No soup for you!"" except with less yelling :( I'd be willing to go back again because I think the food in my other experiences had been fresh and simple without feeling overtly expensive, but Mama K probably won't be coming along because she wasn't too impressed.

 Palm used to rock 5 star food & service years ago, but on a recent visit the service was just awful. Our waiter was constantly MIA and when we did see him and we would ask for things that would never come (drink refills, missing order, fresh cracked pepper, dipping sauce). We were so disparate that we had to flag down other waiters to get anything, including refills on water. I ordered a glass of wine, which took a half hour to arrive and I had to ask about the status 3 times before receiving it. It was a Saturday early afternoon and the lunch traffic was moderate, so I really can't understand why the service was so off. We ordered a side dish for the table of cottage fries that never came, but we were still charged for it when our check arrived. I'm totally bummed because I used to dine here often with fantastic experiences. ",0,1,0,0,0

 If you're going onto the dog side of this vet then I suggest you find another veterinarian in the valley. I came here because of the prices of vaccines (when I should've looked more harder because there is a BETTER place I found).. and that is ALL. My first visit with my new chi puppy was an okay experience. Paper work and the waiting was quick and we were taken care of as soon as possible. **Our first doctor, Dr. Renee Lewis, was very thorough and gave Eva her first shots in front of us. She even explained that Eva would have to come in SEVERAL times for her other shots due to her small size, Eva wouldn't get them all together like regular pups. I kept that in mind and was also sent a reminder of the next TWO vaccines for our next visit. Now our second visit was terrible, terrible, terrible. I brought my boyfriends 2 year old male Bichon, specifically asking for just his rabies shot since he had the others up to date. Apparently, the lady in the front added more vaccines that weren't needed along with giving my chi pup to get the same shots with several others(without informing me of the add ons). The lady nor did our new doctor, Dr. Sharon Lewis, explain what the dogs would be getting before they took our dogs behind closed doors for their vaccines. I didn't know until I saw it all on the receipt because the price was a bit higher than what I expected. When I went back in to explain that I never asked for these shots another lady had to take care of my concern. The original one from the beginning was very rude by telling the other one to pass along that she explained what my dogs were getting. She even told her to tell me that she would go up to talk to me, but instead she walked right passed me. It is very cowardly of her to have her fellow employee take care of me when she was the one to check my two dogs in. I will not be returning due to the fact they said a manager would call me the day after to talk to me about the situation and their employee, who is the first person everyone sees when they walk in, was horrible with customer service.

Months later my head is still spinning from course after course after course which stuffed us til we were barely able to walk! The owner came by and told us that The House is one of the oldest homes in Old Town and I loved all the wonderful stories he told us about the property.

 If you are comparing standard rooms at all the top Vegas hotels I'm not sure if can get better than THEhotel, you can only hope to tie. I enjoyed it equally with Bellagio and Palms when I stayed there in past years. It is tough to pick clear cut winners with the hotels because they offer so much. You can look at the gambling floor, shops, restaurants, clubs, the pool and the list goes on. I really enjoyed the wave pool and the sand beach at Mandalay but did have beef that you couldn't rent tubes for the lazy river. Why would I want to purchase a tube? You think I'm going to deflate it and pack it in my suitcase to take home? I will say my interactions with some of the dealers were the best I've had. I played craps, pai gow, black jack, and roulette and didn't have a complaint about a single person. In fact, most of the people I would rate above average in friendliness and helpfulness. Same goes for the pit boss's. I will say the drink service was a little better than average but not outstanding. There was one time where it seemed like the wait was a bit long, but I give them credit back because the pit boss admitted we had the worst waitress in the casino (she was a bit rotund which prohibited her from moving at a normal rate of speed). The room was on par or better with other MGM Casino I've stayed at (Mirage, Bellagio, New York New York). Overall, if I HAD to come back here next year I wouldn't complain, but would prefer to keep up my tradition of not staying anywhere twice. One day if that becomes impossible, THEhotel will be on the top of my list for the second go around. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Well it was ok. We (2 persons) went in on a Sunday evening for some dinner, at about 8:00. Between us we ordered: Pad Thai; Green Curry; some chicken/cashew thing; 6 appetizer chicken skewers; and rice. Everything tasted good. There were more than enough prawns between the curry and the pad thai, which was nice. Curry was well spiced, and came with a hefty amount of bamboo shoots. The pad thai could have been more zesty, but it wasn't bad. Total came to about 40 \ u00a3, which is definitely on the pricey side. The appetizer chicken skewers were delicious. They came with a really lovely sauce. SUPER slow. The restaurant wasn't very busy (there were about 3 other occupied tables), so food probably should have been much faster. We left after about 1.5 hr, which is a long dining experience here in Scotland. ",0,0,1,0,0

 There's currently a groupon deal so I recommend purchasing it on groupon before going it's $21 for two person entry fee for one time. This spa is a hidden treasure grant it the exterior isn't as nice as the Mandarin but the amenities nonetheless are comparable for this price!!!! It's tucked away on the east side of the strip on Sahara. Their amenities include 6 rooms in which 4 are hot rooms made of stone jade, red clay, and Himalayan salt. These rooms are meant to regenerate your core and relieve any type of muscle pressure or pain in the joints. There is also a room designated specifically for yoga and it'll have a large screen where they show yoga videos. The last room I visit is the ice box room because you will sweat ur nuts off in all of them except for this one, it's literally an ice box. The spa also includes infinity pools and dry sauna and 2 steam rooms: herbal & sea salt. I love coming here with my girlfriends and spending a day just relaxing doing yoga in the hot rooms. We feel great after we leave. Did I mention the spa also has a small fitness room in which you can work out. It's a MUST GO!!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I have celiac disease, so I alerted the hostess and she sent a chef to give me a tour of the buffet. I was dining with my family, one of my children also has celiac and is allergic to dairy. The chef was very knowledgeable, I wish I had written down his name so we could thank him personally. He made us gluten free french toast, brought regular toast, hashbrowns, an eggs bene for me, and pork belly fried rice. He also gave us several items from the back to avoid cross contamination. We were completely thrilled with our brunch, best meal of our trip to Vegas. We really appreciated that he was so knowledgeable, took our food intolerance seriously and didn't seem irritated by going out of his way. Best part- no one got sick!!!!

 I hear about the ""trinity"" of best buffets along the Las Vegas Strip - the Wynn, Bellagio, and Paris. I've had the Wynn twice - the first was incredible, the second time was alright. I've had the Paris once, which I remember being very nice. There was something about the Bellagio buffet, even for lunch, that really made me take note. Everything was so delicious, not to mention beautiful and with such a diverse selection. That's the beauty of a fancy buffet - that there are SO many choices, but places like the Bellagio and Wynn take diversity to new heights with raw-bar offerings (sushi, smoked salmon), multiple pasta dishes, a carving station of perfectly prepared roasts - and this description hardly does a buffet of this caliber justice. This is the farthest thing from your Golden Corral experience!! Back to the Bellagio.. I just can't recommend it enough, and I may go as far as to say it's my favorite buffet experience in Las Vegas to date. I tried everything. I mean... EVERYTHING. And it was all good. (Sushi selection was alright, but I can imagine it's hard to keep really fresh sushi continuously available throughout the day.) And I haven't even mentioned desserts, which I actually felt weren't even the highlight of the meal. Sure they were beautiful and good - mini servings of everything including cr \ u00e8me brul \ u00e9e, key lime pie, carrot cake, etcetera etcetera. I would have been satisfied by the rest of the buffet if the desserts had merely been ice cream! By the way, I arrived for lunch around 12pm and and walked right in. No line folks. However, when we were walking out around 2p, the line to eat was out the door. If you can manage to keep ""normal"" meal hours in Vegas, it seems the lines will be kind to you... ",0,0,0,0,1

 For some strange reason, I've been the duke of this place for the past few months. It's been sitting there begging for me to write a review. And since I still haven't been toppled, I guess I'll cave. I had to go to MW back in August to get a tuxedo fitting. Everything went smoothly. I returned two days before the wedding to pick everything up. Outside of what I consider to be a high price tag, the experience was positive. I've since returned a few times to take advantage of a 50% off coupon we get through work. I've always considered MW to be expensive, but that coupon definitely made things more reasonable. I've been able to pick up some necessary and not-so-necessary items to sharpen up my wardrobe. So despite my cheapness, I'm giving them four stars. The staff are always friendly and helpful and I think I've turned into a fan. ",0,0,0,1,0

 If your looking for something off the dollar menu...sorry, you came to the wrong spot! If your looking for an AWESOME, mouth-watering, big as yo' face, gourmet burger...then this is the place for you!!!! The burgers are fit for a King... or a Queen, like myself :D Indulge has a great menu from fried pickles, fresh salmon salad, onion strings or sweet potato fries, and of course the burgers! They have some pre-combination burgers for you to choose from or if you want to get crafty with your burger you can build your own! I feel the best part of the build your own burger is the unique sauces, from my boyfriends favorite rajun cajun sauce and my go-to spicy sour cream sauce. I love to mix up my burger combination choices whenever I'm at Indulge and I can never go wrong, its always delish!! Besides the food, the staff is very friendly and attentive. Not to mention the owner is always in the restaurant, making sure everyones experience is nothing but the best!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Yum yum yum. Never had a bad meal here - food always delicious and comes out fast. Love the Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao, Panang, and of course the Tom Yung Goong. The service has always been good. Great for dine in or take out. Still my favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place reminds me of the Mexican pavillion at Epcot, a little. As in overdone, but awesome. Hello, 2 story waterfall. The menu is exactly the same as Azteca's, so that's a plus, since Azteca is decent, veg-friendly tex-mex. Pretty sure they're all part of the same local chain. Service is always over the top terrific and we end up leaving a 40% tip often since the bill is always so low - the most expensive thing I've ever ordered here was 9.50. Chips are good and plentiful. Nothing here is blow you away, but most of it is passable, sometimes even good. Don't order the huevos rancheros - probably the least impressive thing on the menu. My favs, at both Pedro's and Azteca, are the Enchiladas de Espinaca - rice, beans, and fresh spinach-stuffed flour tortillas smothered in queso sauce. Yeah, there's veggies in there, but this is heart attack land. Another fav - machos burrito. I guess eating cactus puts hair on your chest. Its a pickle burrito. It is awesome. Have them add some fresh jalapenos for a kick. Its as big as your head, so you'll take some home - fry an egg, stick it on top, you got yourself 3 dollar brekkie. And hey, since Skandalos is right next store, you could stuff your face AND see mexican heavy metal, all in one night. Hell yeah. ",0,0,1,0,0

 To start off I am a loyal Pita Jungle customer! However, I was very disappointed in my visit this weekend (Saturday Night) to the Pita Jungle in the Arcadia area. I waited forever for a table, which I do not mind waiting but this was a little long for my taste. Also the restaurant looked chaotic, employees running around with no direction and very unorganized. Once I ordered, I once again waiting abnormally long for my food. On a positive note the food was very tasty. I usually enjoy my meals here but this time not so much. Hopefully they get it together because I would like to come back, well maybe to a different location. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Some people enjoy wine and cheese. Some people like chips and salsa. Some people favor chocolate and strawberries. But give me some sweets, ice cream and coffee and I'll jump in joy and throw a party! Well that's how if felt when I dined at Serendipity3- I wanted to order all the dessert options on the menu. The Mochaccino is fabulous. Rich hot chocolate with espresso- genius! I wouldn't had wanted to start my sleepless morning any other way. The Frozen Hot Chocolate is scrumptious. I had to control myself in preventing a brain freeze but I couldn't help it. It was oozing and spilling. Haah. The Audrey Sundae- MmmmMmmm. Humble Pie, Vanilla Ice Cream, Coffee Ice Cream, Bananas, Hot Fudge and topped with Whipped Cream, Peanuts and a cherry. If you like coffee ice cream ask for it to be scooped and layered on top of the vanilla or else you're going to have to dig to the bottom of the cup for it. If your giving, definitely share this sundae. But I wouldn't blame you if you rather have it all to yourself ;) The ABC Burger is hefty. The meat patty is cooked to your liking- ours was nice and juicy. With avocados, grilled onions and tomatoes with a slice of pickle on the side. Topping it off with sweet potatoes fries just screams perfect match. The foot long hot dog absolutely calls out food coma. But who can resist a FOOT long hot dog topped with chili, onions, cheddar cheese and a side of steak fries. The breakfast options is also a great start to one's day: x-large sausages, fluffy pancakes and eggs scrambled nicely. Service is alright. The place is so busy, not much attention is given. There are several seating options- inside, outside patio by the entrance for Caesars Palace or outside next to The Strip. Oh, this place is decorated with lots of pink. But your surrounds will be the last of your worries because you will be so concentrated on your food! The stretch to my pants is all well worth it! Serendipity 3, I'll be back =) ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place is pretty casual and especially unique if you like seafood. I walk in with a friend and am immediately directed to the back where i am instructed to pick fish and seafood from the display. There is a pretty large selection of fish on offer. We ended up choosing and entire sea bass which they grilled for us with vegetables, calamari, tiger shrimp and a small bowl of rice. There was a bit of a discrepancy with the cost advertised and the actual cost $/lb but i thought u would let it slide. Chef in the back was not very helpful if you have a question which leaves you a bit clueless. He also seemed to be rushing for no particular reason, there was no line behind us? The food came and it was great the fish was fresh and the calamari was crunchy with just the right amount of batter. Our waitress was ok but overall i was more impressed with the food than the service. For a bill over 75$ for 2 i would expect both. ",0,0,1,0,0

 READ THIS IF YOU ARE A COLLEGE STUDENT - AVOID AT ALL COSTS I am a college student. I was moving in to my new apartment and a man nonchalantly offered me water and promised more free if I signed up for sparkletts. Being a college student I was suckered in at the promise of free stuff and someone being nice, not knowing the pain and countless hours on the phone with the ""people"" in the customer service department. This place can't do one thing right - they could fu** up a cup of coffee - from delivering too many water juggs, charging fees for ENERGY( I already pay a power bill, why do I have to pay sparkletts????!!!!!!!) but foolishly I kept the service, having hope in the human race. Unfortunately my hope has been destroyed, and my wallet has suffered, due to the incompetence of this company and its services. Every day I get water out of this stupid cooler, I kick myself for not buying a Britta. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Worst experience I have ever had at a comedy club. (and I have been to many, in multiple states) There is absolutely zero thought into how they process the people coming in. They take your tickets at the bottom of a staircase in which there are 3 other entries not blocked off. Pretty much anyone can walk in without paying if they felt like it. We get to the hostess stand and they weren't even marking where they sat anyone. Just sending people in 5-6 at a time and leaving the waiters to figure out where to seat anyone. When you get inside, it's not the typical 4 person table at every other comedy club in the country. They have these enormous 6 person monstrosities they take up way too much space, and are roughly 6 inches from the next table. No room to move whatsoever, and half the seat are faced away from the table, so don't bother trying to order food or beverages unless you want to turn 180 degrees around, away from the stage, every time you want a sip or a bite. Ever eat backwards? That's what they expect out of 50% of the people in the room. Room is elbow to elbow with everyone around you, and little to no room to make your way to the bathroom. Literally every inch of floor space is packed with people. My date ordered the mini burgers, which came to the table raw. Sure, cooked on the ouside, but the inside wasn't even cooked enough to be considered ""medium"", it was just raw hamburger. It was 20-30 minutes before our server returned and by then she was too pissed off to even bother asking for COOKED food. She just told him to remove it from the table. Drinks were expensive and hardly poured strong enough to make them worth it. Especially considering the server only came to our table in 20-30 minute incriments. And no lights on the table to turn on when you need service? Have the owners of StandUpLive never been to another comedy club before? I have been to dive clubs in tiny markets with more class than this place. It's all looks, and a total failure in execution. I am going to make every attempt possible to never visit this place ever again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The only thing giving this place 2 stars in my book instead of 1 is that the service was actually pretty good - we were seated promptly, were well attended to, and our server was friendly. The food was god-awful! A friend and I weren't all that hungry, but figured we should eat something before heading to the strip for the night. I had to try the chili con queso since it is one of my weaknesses. This was one of the worst I've had. Not only was it velveeta-esque, it really didn't have any kick to it at all. I added healthy amounts of a couple of different hot sauces on the table and it still was barely edible. I also had the chicken tortilla soup. Weirdest tortilla soup I've ever had. Once again not very spicy, and the ""broth"" was like a thick barbeque-sauce. And, the most plentiful ingredient in my soup - corn! What little chicken was in there was tasty. I hunted it out and left the rest. My friend got a couple of the street tacos and wasn't thrilled. He actually commented that we should have gone to Roberto's (which I guess is a fast food Mexican place - I'm not from the area). To top it all off, it's supposed to be a sports bar and the TV we were sat next to was on the fritz, with the color and picture going out at regular intervals. My advice, skip this place and find somewhere else. Maybe Roberto's? ",0,1,0,0,0

 May 23, 2014.. well that was interesting.I'm a big believer in redemption stories.. I know I always want a chance to make it right if I've screwed up with new or existing customers. To that end, I just visited this dry cleaners again. As I said earlier while I don't trust them to get my business shirts right after two tries, they do repair and alterations work well. So I took them a pair of Levi's with a torn belt loop and two casual shirts that don't need special attention, just cleaning. So I went in..then it got weird..I put my stuff on the counter... so as the owner put my name in the register, he got all hurt look. Ask me why I was putting bad reviews on his business and why I came back. I told him the reviews weren't 'bad', they were my initial two experiences with his business. I changed the second one to update it to say they did do alterations and repairs real well. Again he ask why I'm making him look bad with my reviews. I ask him if he wanted me to lie about my experiences just so he wouldn't look bad. He then blamed me, again, that I must not have told them to fold the shirts. He said we got it right the second time so why was I making him look bad. I reminded him the first time it was two shirts. When I got them back on hangers after giving clear instructions, I just took them home and folded them myself. The second time it was one shirt, again brought out on a hanger. When I reminded her of my order, she quickly took it in the back and did a pretty poor job of folding it and wrapping it in plastic for travel. (John's folds the shirts with precision, wraps them with precision then put them in a box). After hearing him blame me again for not telling them, I ask him if he thoughtI would drop off two 90 business shirts to a new cleaners without giving them clear instructions of how I wanted my shirts? I told him I've been doing business travel for 15+ year and would never not mentioned how I needed shirts that I knew had to come immediately into a suitcase for my next trip. He then said I was making him look bad again. I said I left the first time thinking maybe they just didn't have a register that could make a note to medium starch, fold for travel? He says they do, I probably didn't tell them. That his employee has been their 9 years or something and they don't make mistakes..they pride themselves on the details.. I said well that didn't happen. Twice. Again with the why do keep coming back and putting reviews that make them look bad. In frustrating, I said ""Jesus!"". Grab my stuff off the counter and left completely bewildered. Maybe next time, rather than defend his reputation or employee or never admit that a mistake is even possible he should try ""Jim, I'm really sorry about that. We screwed up. Twice. I'd love a chance to make this right and get your business. I'm committed to doing right by you""....just a thought. I'm done with them. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Looks like it's been about a year and a half since I did my St. Francis review. Good timing - as I was asked to suggest dinner ideas for my cousins visiting from New York. And ideas for Sunday brunch with a dear friend and her daughter. So happy we decided to come here! (Yes - two visits in one weekend - score for me!) For dinner - we arrived close to 6:30, a party of 4 with no reservations. No problem - we were seated in under 20 minutes (we got lucky!) We ordered way too much food - the four of us shared 2 apps, 3 salads and 2 entrees - as well as a few cocktails. It was all SO GOOD! Our server Barry was perfectly on point through the night - my NYC cousins were sufficiently impressed - and St. Francis retains its placement as one of my favorite Valley restaurants. Fingerling potatoes, baked goat cheese, romaine hearts, kale ceasar, beets, roasted salmon superfood and the special that night of half a roasted chicken. All prepared and plated beautifully. None of us had room for dessert - so that will be a goal for next time! For brunch Sunday - we arrived at 10:15 - I had made reservations and we were seated immediately. Cocktails and coffee for the grownups, mocktail for the daughter. We shared a baker's board and ordered the kid's pancake, smoked salmon flatbread and tomato baked eggs. There was no room for dessert - but with the lemon and pear muffin, carrot cake and cinnamon roll from the baker's board - we didn't really need it. Once again - and proving the consistency in service and food from my first review - St. Francis does it right! So happy to have it nearby - and need to keep it on my heavy rotation list! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Three Amigos is the best Mexican food ever! It is so authentic and tastes so fresh. The queso is my favorite and the guacamole is to die for. Made so fresh and so yummy!

 I'd rate this 3.5 if half stars were an option. The food is solid and it's certainly better than most burrito options in Charlotte but it's not as good as I was expecting based on the reviews. You get a lot of food for your money here and for the most part, I enjoyed my burrito. However, I wasn't crazy about a lot of the sauce and salsa options and that's an important part of a burrito. They have several different hot sauces so I was initially pretty excited when I saw the salsa bar but I had trouble finding one I really liked. They all had a strange creamy taste to them and none of them were really spicy. The habanero one is the best (you have to ask for this one) but I've had better habanero sauces before. The spicy chicken on my burrito was fresh tasting and tender but it also was over salted. In summary, it's a good place to go if you're craving a burrito but I'm not sure it lives up to the five star ratings I keep seeing. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Moved here unknowingly from out of state upon my honorable discharge from the army. It could have been better. 1 - I was robbed from this location because security is a joke. Don't let them fool you with ""we have nighttime roving security"". I lost track of how many times I've seen security sitting down with earphones in. 2 - Unless you live directly around the clubhouse, there's no camera coverage for you in case something occurs...like a burglary! 3 - Management is ok. The junior employees are helpful and nice. Can't say much for anybody above them... 4 - Again; security - I don't know if they're tenants waiting to get in but everyone and their mother waits for a tenant with a gate opener to enter the property. Or waits for someone exiting to enter the property. How about get some one-way spike strips? The gate to tenant calling operation is crap. You MUST have a 702 number to operate it to open the gate for yourself. 5 - Can't speak for anybody else but if you're on the first floor, bugs central. 6 - I cleaned the hell out of these apartments when I left, and still owed some on my deposit. I over-cleaned personally having moved into a less than stellar apartment. 7 - The property is nice. Very green and well groomed. Outside of the apartments is good too. Very close to the Galleria Mall and Costco. If you're a Costco shopper. Overall, keep looking but it's not the worst place to move into. Good luck on your search! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm not sure if I caught them on one of those days, but my first(and only) experience here was less than memorable. I decided to give these guys a shot after my first choice was closed(it was a Sunday). I found them on Yelp, and it said that they were open. I tried the phone number that was listed several times, but all I got was a busy signal. Since I was leaving work, I didn't have time to try and find another place, and this place was on the way, so I figured I'd see if they were in fact open like Yelp said. The place was easy to find, on Chandler just west of Dobson. I saw they had a drive-thru for call-ahead orders. That'd be great if you could actually get through on the phone. They were definitely open, so I walked in to place my order for take-out. The inside was actually pretty nice looking. It was nicely decorated. Not overly done, the lighting was down a little, and it made for a comfortable atmosphere. Not very noisy either. Seemed like a nice little place to come and sit for a meal. They were very quick to greet me and to take my order. It was a simple order, as I ordered chicken paht thai, medium spiciness, and a couple egg rolls. If you can get through on the phone, I highly recommend ordering ahead. I felt a bit awkward standing around, with no place for those waiting on take-out to sit. I ended up leaning against a small counter in the corner of the restaurant because there was no place to wait. I guess you could have sat at one of their dining tables, but that's not my style. The food was fairly quick. Less than ten minutes and I was out the door. Smelled great too. When I got home, I quickly sat down with my wife, dished up a plate, and dug in. The egg rolls were actually really good. They were a bit smaller than what I expect egg rolls to be, but they still had good flavor. The paht thai is where things went south pretty quick. My wife and I love paht thai, and this is what we get all the time. We just moved to Arizona, so we are trying to find a place that nails it down. This wasn't it. Let me start by saying the spiciness was right on. It wasn't too spicy, but it still gave a slight burn. Pretty right on for ""medium"". That's all it had going though. Overall it was very flavorless. I was very disappointed with each bite I took, as I expected it to get better. Unfortunately it never did. Even at the very end, I grabbed a piece of chicken and ate it. It too was absolutely flavorless and dry. I would never order paht thai from here again. Seeing a lot of positive reviews on here makes me think I ordered the wrong thing, however paht thai seems to be a pretty easy and common dish at Thai restaurants. If they can't nail that down, it leaves me with little or no hope for the rest of the menu. Plus, at $14 something for that and 3 tiny egg rolls, I expect a hell of a lot more. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Always come early on the weekend if you don't want to wait a long time in their small entryway where you always feel like you are in someone's way.

 Standard Fox concept: great atmosphere with overpriced basic food. The Yard is a really cool spot to take a large group and have cocktails and average quality food while playing games. Had somewhat of a ""hipster"" vibe to it like most joints in Central Phoenix do. The back is a giant indoor patio with lounge seating near tvs to watch sports and the end is full of games like shuffle board, corn hole, ping pong and fooseball. Real cool vibe in central Phoenix.

 I like the Brass Ring. Even though the ceilings are a ba-jillion feet tall, it feels cozy inside. The pool tables are challenging (they're HUGE) and the service is just attentive enough. On top of that they have decent food and really well crafted drinks. Hendrick's press with freshly muddled cucumber? Don't mind if I do.

 Attention TAO Management: Your hostess was one of the worst I've encountered, period. I walked in looking to make dinner reservations and waited several minutes for the hostess to look up at me from her computer station. She was (apparently) doing something on her computer at the host stand and not once looked up, even though I was standing literally two feet in front of her. After several minutes, she looked up at me and said, ""Yes?"" as if I was an inconvenience. Having worked in the service industry for years, I expect the hostess to represent the establishment and treat guests accordingly. Seeing as I was looking to have a special dinner on a Friday night at the Las Vegas strip, I walked away after her lack of consideration and class. I have heard rave reviews about this place, so I will try again at a later date. Hopefully the restaurant and club will be better represented by it's staff. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This restaurant is a small place but didnt need to wait for seats. I went w a friend and We both ordered the beef noodle soup and an order of shrimp dumplings. The waiter misunderstood us and thought we ordered one soup and one dumplings. I started the noodles, which were good in itself but the entire noodle soup was unappetizing and not very tasty. The meat was fatty and looked like scrap. I don't like food, and esp meat, to go to waste but I could not get myself to finish this. The shrimp dumplings weren't that great either.

 We had a restaurant.com gift certificate that needed using, so we headed down there. When we walked in the door we were greeted with smiles and shown to our table in a very nicely decorated restaurant with good atmosphere. To start with, we both had Thai iced teas that were fantastic and refilled before they were halfway empty. We shared a bowl of Tom Kha Gha, which was the best I've ever had. For entrees, we had the Red Curry with Chicken and Sweety Duck, both of which were fantastic. The duck was moist with a nice crispy skin and honey glaze, served with steamed broccoli. The curry had a generous amount of meat and the veggies were fresh and not overcooked. Dessert was the house specialty: Mango with Sticky Rice. Excellent, though it's seasonal, subject to ripe mangos, so take advantage in the springtime! Homemade Coconut Ice Cream is also on the menu, though we didn't get to try it because we were stuffed. As mentioned in other reviews, the portion size is generous. Neither my wife nor I were able to finish our entrees and it was packed up with extra rice to take home. Excellent, friendly service, good quality food at a reasonable price in a nice environment. Adds up to 5 stars to me! Oh, and they deliver. ",0,0,0,0,1

 When I go to Vegas, I am there to visit family and enjoy some gambling and food. I stay and play like a local, so I prefer to spend my time and money Downtown. The Strip is great for tourists, people who like to party and families with kids, but I am none of those, so I don't miss the glitz and glamour of The Strip. My favorite upscale restaurant to eat at (and I eat there at least once every visit) is Second Street Grill inside The Fremont Hotel. It is a Pan-Asian steakhouse with lots of great seafood and steak. It is a little hard for wheelchairs to get in and out, but they will work with you to make sure everyone is comfortable. The ambience is classy with low-lighting and the casino noise is pretty much nil (until someone opens the door and even then it's not bad). The service is usually great (They have occasional slammed-busy nights) and the busboys, waitstaff and hostesses do a great job. I love the food here - not only is the presentation nice, but the choices are varied and quality is excellent. There are a few dishes that I have not liked as much as others, but that happens and it's subjective. Appetizers are big and can be shared between 2 people - I highly suggest the caprese salad ((Fresh tomato slices, chopped basil, balsamic vinegar and beautiful fresh mozzarella cheese) , the soft-shell crabs (Crispy and tender and so flavorful!), the Peking duck tacos (A little messy, but so yummy!) or the sashimi (Super fresh and delicious). The shrimp cocktail is also really good with gigantic tiger prawns cooked to tenderness (not rubbery and over-cooked) served with a really good cocktail sauce. For entrees, the steaks are always good - the filet mignon is tender and flavorful and the New York and Ribeye steaks are big and meaty. The pork is thick and juicy and the whole fish is really tender and a great presentation. The only entree I have had where I was disappointed has been the Tempura -- The batter was thick and heavy and I didn't care for it. One of my favorite entrees is the lobster tail. The lobster tails are HUGE - I am talking the meat, out of the shell is gigantic. Not only is the lobster huge, it tastes great and they will remove it from the shell for you if you ask them to. The drawn butter is served over a candle to stay warm and melted throughout the meal. The desserts here are really good. They have changed them recently, so the creme brulee is no longer available, but the ice cream is always good! This place is not cheap, but it is completely worth the money to get away from the noise of Las Vegas and enjoy an intimate and fabulous meal. Most people shun the Downtown areas as being low-rent and where losers and old folks hang out.

 Oh my goodness, I wish there were more stars to give. Six? Seven? Does this mean I have to knock some stars off my other yarn store reviews? Maybe. Just maybe. Knit Happens just ""happens"" (eek) to be the most gorgeous yarn store I have seen in... well, maybe ever. It is the most spacious, shopable, and beautifully laid-out store I have been to in the Valley. Upon entering, a zen-like calm descended and I felt immediately I would be coming here again... and again... I was worried because I had a hard time getting them on the phone. I kept getting a FAX machine, then a message, then a FAX machine again and I was concerned they weren't really open. When I finally got to speak to someone in person, I was a little more concerned because the woman seemed a little confused by my book request. But then, they've been open less than a month and I was looking for a particular book... but they had it and put it on hold for me. I had already decided I would come again, if ONLY for the covered parking. Much appreciated in the first week of September in Phoenix. That it was simple to get a stroller in there was another plus. But the toys for my three-year-old!? A lot of craft stores have a handy bucket of old, cruddy toys that are at least 'new' to your little ones, but this was a SPREAD. Kid-sized table and chairs, coloring books, blocks, legos, hobby horse, a huge bucket of dinosaurs of all kinds, etc. Yeah, I'll be back. I can't get my kid to leave! But I came for the yarn. And yarn they have. Not a crappy, acrylic brand in sight. GORGEOUS stuff. They have TONS of Debbie Bliss yarn and patterns, all the Sublime books and yarn, a lot of Tahki, the new Teva Durham yarns, a great Mission Falls selection. Some great recycled yarns I am not familiar with... I could go on and on. This is high-end, fashion-forward, beautiful stock - the only store that comes close to this kind of yarn in the (NORTH) Valley, in my opinion, is Jessica Knits, which is just so damn far away... I am a yarn geek, in that I like to surf the web and find new yarns, and I love to be surprised at a yarn store, which I certainly was here. I had a hard time committing to a project, there were so many beautiful yarn choices, and fantastic pattern books, too. Staff was FANTASTIC: friendly, not horrified by my kids, so accommodating and not overbearing as some other stores. 5 stars for them, too. The store, as I said, is very spacious. A huge kitchen and staff room in back with the kids' play area. The main store area, beautifully laid out, easy to see the yarn, as I said, very shopable. There is also a HUGE project table, very cool, that sits probably 8 or 10 people. Every seat has a sort of cubby (an indentation in the table) that will either hold your ball of yarn, or your drink so it doesn't spill on your work. There is a room behind the project table with chairs, couch, big screen TV and pattern books and magazines. You can cozy up, watch the food channel, browse books or stick your non-knitting friend/husband/carpool there to enjoy him or herself. You've got to go to Knit Happens. I think it is SUPERIOR to many Valley stores - only Jessica Knits is in this league. If you want current, high-quality yarns, fashion-forward project ideas with fantastic service, go to Knit Happens. The staff said there are tons more new yarns coming in every day. Can't wait to go back. ",0,0,0,0,1

 My husband went into Bed Bath & Beyond with one simple goal this evening - buy a new vacuum. He had it all picked out and had his coupon ready. In his words, this was the worst experience he has ever had at a BB&B and ""maybe ever in a retail store."" While I know Yelp encourages people to write about their own personal experiences, my husband does not have a Yelp account and asked me to write this for him. His complaints: 1. The aisles are too narrow to get a cart down. The vacuums were located at the end of a section that was not reachable by cart. A vacuum is a pretty big item that one would need a cart for, so instead he had to carry it down to the end of the aisle. Not a huge deal but still a pain. 2. In addition to the aisles being too narrow, there were ""things"" on the ground and in the way in many of them - display models, etc. It didn't seem as though they were in transition and the items were there temporarily as they moved things around - they were just in the way. 3. When it was time to check out, the two women at the check out were so busy talking to each other that they did not have time to acknowledge that there was a customer. They could see that there was a person in line, but still stood there finishing their own conversation before helping him. 4. There was no pen to sign for a credit card purchase. Silly, but...it's a store. Where people use credit cards all day long. Shouldn't a pen be readily accessible? 5. The entire walkway from the register to the exit was blocked with shopping carts. My husband had to push them all out the way to get out of the store. 6. And finally, after all of this, the check out person forgot to take the security tag off of our new vacuum, so the alarm went off, and he had to wait there until they fixed the situation. He was not pleased. This is a bummer to me, as I have always enjoyed shopping at Bed Bath & Beyond. I can only hope the next time we stop by the store we have a more positive experience, and I can come back and update the review!! :) ",0,1,0,0,0

 If I could give it 0 stars I would! 21.99$ for the seafood and more buffet (the only dinner they have). For that price I thought that they would have a big selection. They have cold shrimp, muscles,and oysters; they were in water not ice and looked like they had been sitting out for at least 5 hours. Eek that's gross! I would spend the extra 5-6 dollars and go to the rio instead more food and it is defiantly safer to eat since they take more care of it as far as temp. Goes! I will never be back to this buffet! I guess ppl call it the toilet bowl buffet! Beware! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I ordered the Double Fat Matt tonight....haven't eaten all day! The burger was really good, my wife's wings were also spot on, and the potato skins were freshly made and delicious. I couldn't finish the other half of the burger, too much...but very good. Fries were hot and crispy, bleu cheese had chunks of real bleu cheese chunks the size of Oregon in it and went really well with the wings. Service and food consistency has always been very good here.

 Getting take-out from Luigi's every Friday night at work has become a ritual I've really looked forward to over the last 3 or 4 years, but recently it seems to me the quality has slipped. For some reason they changed the way they cut their onions and bell peppers used on the pizza's, stromboli's, sandwiches, and other dishes - cutting them into large chunks that don't have time to thoroughly cook. In my opinion raw chunks of bell peppers and onions are not good on a pizza, or anything else for that matter, unless it's a salad. I suggest thinly slicing the peppers and onions as other pizzerias do and that should take care of the problem - in my opinion. Hopefully the owners will take this seriously and address this issue. But for now I'll pass on Luigi's ... ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place was exactly what we wanted: a low-key off-strip mexican place with good food. The food & ambiance are what we wanted, and the price wasn't bad either. Regular ""combos"" going from 10-15 and specialties ranging from 15-20. We live in san diego so mexican food is something we're pretty darned familiar with. I had a combo with flautas (which turned out to look more like a enchilada, i wasn't expecting it to be covered) and a taco. My wife had a tostada. The chips you could tell were made fresh, and the salsa was pretty good as well. Service was very good. If you're looking for a nice mexican place, then viva mercados is a good choice. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I gave this place two chances to prove itself, but they have failed me. Visited this place when all the hype came about but was severely disappointed in both the size and taste of these tacos. Yes, I know they are street tacos and they run small, but I had to order 20 just to get a good fill, so I decided to order every kind of taco they had. I wish I could tell you what those tacos tasted like, but they all lacked flavor ....literally no flavor. I'm quite shocked at the reviews raving about the best tacos around....clearly these tacos do not fit in any kind of a ""good"" category. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Not bad for me at all! Nacho Mama app was a hit with my group of 8, server was super friendly, and we were given free salad and dessert! Definitely comfort food- don't expect a ton of healthy options. Visited on a Thursday night in the early evening a couple months ago. My group was seated immediately in one of the upper areas, which was nice since we were a large group and the downstairs area seemed pretty loud and dark. Price tag ended up at about $120 with tax and tip if I remember correctly, or less than $20 per person. Especially appreciated the tip to visit the ice cream shop around the corner... it was amazing! I think it was called Dave and Andy's or something, but you'll know it by the big ice cream cone sign over the entrance. Perfect dessert :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 When I first walked into Stoney's North Forty, I thought I walked into a hamster cage, not a restaurant. While I could have done without the wood chips scattered throughout the floor of North Forty, the food and service was actually quite good! This came as a surprise to me because this place was completely empty! Even though I don't dance (I'm as white as they come) and I hate country music (okay; maybe I'm NOT as white as they come), I felt comfortable eating inside of North Forty. With the big dance floor in the middle of the restaurant, I envisioned how rednecks must be having the time of their lives on Friday and Saturday nights. With FREE dance lessons and occasional FREE live events (American Idol's Bo Bice, baby!), Stoney's North Forty is a white people paradise. The food itself at North Forty was pretty good. From the smell emanating from the restaurant you could tell they use a BBQ smoker. The portions that you receive for the price are about what you would expect. I didn't really care for the coleslaw (made with horseradish and slimy), but the philly cheese steak was big, tasty, and made me hot in the pants. Don't expect extraordinary eats at North Forty, but there is a little something for everyone. Did I mention they have their own homemade barbecue sauces? YEE HAW, PARDNER! If you take away the poop sprayed all over one of the ladies room toilets and the wood chips on the floor (sorry to repeat myself; the wood chips aren't only tacky but how do you sweep around them? If they sweep...), Stoney's North Forty would have earned a four star rating. For lack of a more creative finish; go to Stoney's, cowboy. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've always wanted to go here it looks so cool and different. So my friend and I went today sat outside it was a while before anyone helps us and when someone did we order out drinks and he ask for my Id so I gave it to him as he bent my iD I asked him what he's doing he said its fake I said no its not I'm about to be 23 so I pull out my passport id (I carry it everywhere with me) and gave him that. And he started bending that one as well and said its fake. I'm was getting upset. And said no its not as he rudely cut me off and said "" were strict down here"" I said really I've been down on mill before and never had a problem. (Even when I was under age and had a fake ID.) so we said never mind we don't want to drink as he said good because I can't serve you. So we start to order I ask for a salad no radish he said what no radish I said yes and my friend said he wanted a burger with Fry's as the guys rudely rolled his eyes and said we don't have Fry's. so we got up and left!!

 Hough's Bar is another one of those neighborhood joints. I can remember years ago when it was kind of rough at times. It was closed and then bought out by another couple who upgraded the place.

It's mainly appetizers, sandwiches, and burgers. The burgers here are pretty good. They're mainly huge, half-pound behemoths, but for those of us with smaller appetites, they have a decent 1/4 lber.

Whether you're in the mood for breakfast (served ALL DAY), lunch (sandwiches) or dinner (entrees), Chompie's has the best breakfasts, best sandwiches (the corned beef sandwich will give you enough meat to make another 2-3 sandwiches), and best home cooked entrees I've ever eaten at a deli.

 I am so very thankful to Will from Homepride Inspectors for his very valuable and professional services. Will is so amazing and the best inspector EVER!! He is really looking out for the buyers interests and he works for the buyers. I am amazed on how specific and thorough he is. It seamed like he was inspecting the house like I was one of his family members. He really does care and you can tell he loves his job. I would recommend him in a heartbeat to anyone that is looking for a true and honest inspection. I usually don't recommend people especially with such an important choice, however, I have no doubt in my mind that Will will care for your interest as he did with me. Thank you once again for your professionalism, unbiased, and expert services Will. I am amazed :-) I had previously had a horrible experience with another company that had been biased and I lost thousands of dollars unknowingly buying a very damaged house. So a big thank you from me and my family!! :-) ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was blown away by the sheer beauty of this stadium. Quite possibly the nicest stadium I've seen thus far, however I haven't been to Dallas yet. I came here to watch the Green Bay Packers take on the Cardinals during Game 1 of the Wildcards, which was a HUGE beating for Arizona, but I guess it was a smart move on their part for conserving their energy for their victorious and important Game 2. They had the roof closed, even though it was very nice outside (mid 70's). The scoreboards and screens were easy to glance at during the plays and you can really get a feel of how serious the people who jigged up this place were when they designed .it. The staff working at this stadium are very pro, and very attentive. Parking was easy, and getting out after the game was easy. I had an enjoyable time here, and was glad to have finally been able to watch Rodgers play in person. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I purchased a lot of supplies to make crafty things for my wedding this summer. Afterwards, I had a number of items left over that I hadn't used, so my mother helped me out by returning some of the items for me. One of the receipts fell between her car seats, so a few of the items were not returned with original receipt. This store has a policy of returning the lowest value at which the item has ever been priced, if you don't have a receipt. One of the items had been clearanced out, so she received less than half the price we paid back on a merchandise card. This particular item had been purchased less than a week prior, so this really irritated me. When we discovered the receipt between the car seat, I went back to Joann's and asked them to return the full amount of money. While I didn't think I was going to get it back on my credit card, I was hoping that I could at least get the full credit. Here's where things dissolved. I entered the store and went to the nearest cashier. She looked at me blankly when I told her what I wanted to do, and referred me to an older lady named Jean. Jean was very nice and said that she could help me out. She proceeded to try to get the appropriate amount back to me by re-returning the item at the normal price, then having me pay back the clearance amount. However, she screwed up and did not actually refund the normal price back to me (she said she was putting it on my gift card). When I tried to explain that she was actually having me leave the store with LESS money than when I came in, she got upset and tried to tell me that I didn't understand the process that she was using. I understood perfectly, and kept trying to explain to her how the balance on the gift card was LESS not more. Finally, she got extremely frustrated with me (I was very polite, and kept thanking her for helping me out, and was never rude during the entire process) and went to talk to the manager. The manager had her refund the clearance price back to me (which was put on a separate gift card). So, I ended up leaving the store with the EXACT same amount of money as when I went in. This poor cashier just couldn't understand what I was saying, and wouldn't listen to me. So my whole visit to the store was pointless -- in fact, now I have the same amount of money on two separate gift cards instead of one. I'm sure at the end of the night, this cashier's register didn't total up, since the money was never refunded to me. Oh well. Caveat emptor. And now I'm stuck with these stupid gift cards. (Yeah, first world problems, I realize.) ",0,1,0,0,0

 Their bread is heavenly. Have I had better breads? Yes (cue in Thomas Keller), but I'm a huge fan of Bon Breads and the great access you have to their arsenal makes this spot a must. A few tips: obviously, go in the morning because they bake it fresh in the valley; check out their bread of the week that they offer for half the price (a wonderful way to try a new flavor); and get a stamp card! I've enjoyed everything I've tried and my favorites are the BACON AND ONION BATARD and WHITE CHOCOLATE BATARD. The brioche loaves and rolls are also amazing. It'll change your life. Oh, and if you've had bread at your favorite restaurant in town and thought to yourself, ""OMGOSH,"" it was most likely from Bon Breads - their client list is vast and impressive (they supply a list on their website). And we're fortunate to be able to visit a retail storefront for the same quality bread to enjoy at home. I've served several flavors of their batards with simple or flavored (they sell them there!) extra virgin olive oils or with cured meats and cheeses for guests and it's always a hit! I've also prepared French toast with their WHITE CHOCOLATE BRIOCHE and it was fantastic! Batards are $12 each and may seem a bit much, but it's worth it. It also makes a wonderful snack when your kids are playing at the Town Square park or just walking around the mall. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I'm not really sure why all the marginal reviews of BLT. I went in at a fairly busy time and was seated fairly quickly.

It was exceptional, possibly one of the best burgers I've had in Vegas, and I've tried a lot. My friend had the Texas Burger with no bun and he seemed very happy with it. The waffle fries were good, but not great. The onion rings were excellent!

 Located in Summerlin but for some reason sporting a pair of security officers at the door during both of my visits it seems somewhat strange to me that this book store needs much 'protection' given the upper-middle class clientele, but what is even more perplexing to me is how this place stays in business considering their across-the-board high prices and substantial overcrowding of the floor space. Generally trending $2-$6 higher than Amazon even before taking tax into account and seemingly happy to hire clerks that value neither their own knowledge of the store layout nor the customer's time the only positive I can say for B&N is that it is within walking distance of my house and when I need something 'now' I don't need to wait for shipping.

My group and I arent stuck up asian who think the whole world should revolve around them so waiting in line for 15 mins wasnt the end of the world. The check in girl was so nice and also the guys working the ropes. When I read the review of other people, it made me wonder how stuck up they are. Let the people do their jobs and if you could do it better them, work there. But since none of you will, let them be. Also your promoter should tell you things, if not keep bugging them so they will tell you. Another thing all you spoiled young children There was a time no one got into a club free. So be thankful.

 Accidentally found this place. We were totally on the way to the Thai place on the same plaza when Chez Monieux appeared. Cajun food? Hummmm... My friend said he had Thai but have not had Cajun and that sealed the deal. So, we go inside and place is totally empty. I mean no one is there. WOW What the?!? But no matter, we were quickly greeted and seated at the table of our picking. Chit-chat with the guy and turns out they are like super new. Just opened up and not many people even know about them, and today supposedly weirdly slow anyhow. Ok cool, better for us!! We order up 2 platters and it shows up real quick. They even split it for us as we asked, so we can easily try each other orders. And try we did! It was GOOD! I mean, really REALLY good stuff. And it was lots of it. Did i mention it was good? In fact, my buddy could not stop eating it even though her kept on saying -""I can not stuff anything else in!"" But its simply too hard to pull yourself from it. I do not give rave reviews very often, but this is totally one of them. You should absolutely check it out, its worth it. Yes, it might be in the little plaza next to the freeway and ambiance might be all but non-existent. But who cares?!? Go for food. You will not be disappointed!

 After much thought of where we'd brunch amidst the breakfast oasis of options that Phoenix has to offer, I decided upon Phoenix Public Market Caf \ u00e9. It was a lazy Sunday around 11:30am, I had time to kill and I was prepared to wait in line. To my surprise, there were only two people in front of me! Wait, what I am I supposed to order? The menu had many salivating options and I was one of those people who just couldn't decide right away. To add to my mental food frenzy, Phoenix is no longer my home and I only return every couple of years so I had to make a good choice. Thankfully, my girlfriend, a regular at PPMC, came to my rescue and recommended the pork chile verde pot pie. The pork chile verde pot pie was an excellent choice! It was delicious and had the most flaky and buttery crust ever! Pot pies are one of my many guilty food indulgences and this was definitely one of my favorites! The portion size was generous and I did not finish, but maybe it is because I also ate a side of bacon, a lemon and pistachio macaron, and a yummy, large peanut butter cookie sandwich with my meal! What can I say, I'm only in Phoenix every once in a while! The service at PPMC is friendly and prompt and the ambiance is casual, inviting, and hip. I love the market meets caf \ u00e9 idea. The outdoor area had picnic style seating and fresh flowers adorned each table. It was a cheerful atmosphere for a wonderful brunch in the beautiful Phoenix sun. My next visit to Arizona, I will surely return to Phoenix Public Market Caf \ u00e9 and dine again! ",0,0,0,1,0

 My first visit came here over the weekend. I liked it....you underwhelmed with that statement? Well, that's kinda how I felt about Cantina. I like it, I really do but maybe my taste buds and palette isn't distinguished enough to discern between Mexican meals. What I mean is, yeah it was fine and the fresh and all things good but I didn't come away from the place thinking OMG, I can't wait to get back. One thing I will say is that I really like the upscale (compared to most Mexican joints) interiors. So if I want to step it up a couple notches from some place like an Azteca, I'll visit Cantina. But if I'm looking to just get down and grub on some Mexican cuisine I'd probably stick to the Azteca type faire. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I recently took the Grand Canyon tour around the Christmas holidays. The tour guide was excellent. He was full of fun and interesting facts about AZ. People don't normally think of the desert and think of snow or cold, but North Arizona is quite different than the desert. We first took a short stop in Sedona. Later, we continued north to see snow all around. We traveled through Navajo country. When I finally got to the Grand Canyon, I took the helicopter ride around the canyon. The view was magnificent. It was one of the most breathtaking sites I've seen. I truly enjoyed my tour! I will definitely do it again - especially if family comes in from out of town. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I know, I know... How does one become a fan of any State department, let alone the red-headed-step-child of them all (the DMV)? Simple. This particular location is incredibly efficient. I've rarely, if ever, had to wait more than 5 minutes before being helped. And the staff, while not jovial, is extremely knowledgable and for the most part, friendly and helpful. A few years ago, while renewing my license plates, I asked one of the staff for any tips about the best time to visit this location, and she said that Friday mornings before 11:00am are usually the best. She was right-on. I've followed her advice by visiting on Thursdays or Fridays prior to 10:45am and have never once waited in line. The WI DMV now takes debit/credit cards, although they do charge an additional $1.25 service fee (I thought that was illegal, according to Visa/MasterCard terms??) if you use the plastic. So... while we all dread visiting the DMV, this one's not half bad. ",0,0,0,1,0

 On a trip to Montreal, we stumbled upon this restaurant just in need of something quick and nearby. The menu looked interesting and affordable. It's a large restaurant, with outdoor seating and the restaurant itself is pretty open. I ordered the pork shank house speciality, which only ran about $15 so I thought it would be a good portion. It was humungous! Two large pork shanks, both fatty and tender, along with veggie sides (basically just a big piece of broccoli) and fries that I substituted for sweet potato fries. A bit too satisfied, I couldn't finish it all... Everyone else's dishes looked really tasty, from chicken burgers to the steak. We also shared the appetizer Flammekeuches? which is kind of like a really thin/flat pizza. With bacon, gruyere cheese and onions, it was a nice light snack but only had about 1.5 small pieces each for 10 people. Overall enjoyable! And they offered to do separate checks, which was convenient. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Awful service. Mediocre food. I was dining alone, and I asked for a table. The lady who seated me put me in a completely empty section, and told me she'd bring my drink. I went to the buffet. When I returned, no drink. I had to go hunt down a waitress to get my drink. The food was slightly below the quality you get at Golden Corral. For $30, you would expect a really good buffet, but the food was tepid, over cooked, and largely bland. The deserts were fair. I cleaned my first plate (it didn't have much on it to begin with) and went for a bit more. My dirty plate remained on the table the entire time I remained in the buffet - nor was my drink ever refilled. More people had been seated in my section by that time, but I guess nobody told the waitress who was helping them, cause she ignored me and my attempts to get eye contact. Finally, enough was enough. I left, without any tip. 2 stars only because the food was edible. ",0,1,0,0,0

Food was plentiful. Our table got a freebie of teriyaki shrimp (maybe they do this for all tables?). Our party had the chicken and steak selections, all good. 2 adults and 2 kids.

 We're staying at Palms Place and we fell in love with Simons. We've gone there for Sunday brunch, breakfast and dinner 4 times. The hostess is super sweet and the manager is super cool and nice. We had a really good waiter for dinner named Steve. He was on the ball with everything. We gave him a generous tip and by the time we got back up to our room our phone was ringing. It was Steve thanking us for our generosity. I've never had that happen. The lobster mac and cheese and caesar salad are our top favorite. We won't be staying at Palms Palace ever again due to our terrible experience BUT will definitely be coming back to Simon's. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Didn't eat here, so we'll start with that. Went in for a drink. Place is really nice and homey with brick curved walls and a really open floor plan. They have TV's and b/c I have a drinking/gambling problem, they do comp drinks [even nice glasses of wine priced ~$15/glass] when you gamble. Hooray! They have outside seating and a really cute fireplace outside as well. They had lots of tables open, so that kind of worried me, but they did have a HUGE bar area. Definitely would go back again and try their food. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We did my aunts birthday dinner, considering it being 5 star restaurant, their service was crappy. My aunt turned 90, you know it's a big one, we made a reservation and asked for the special cake(of course we verified the price and everything) they couldn't find a damn cake for a while. I saw a hostess writing it down, ""party of 10 with chocolate bday cake"" when we got there, she asked us back, ""oh did it write it down? Oh we are sorry, we can't find it right now"" what the hell. It was frustrating, they could find the cake for a while. And then the waiter spilt water on my uncle. To top it off, there's no garnish or anything on your food, if you order piece of meat, that's all you are gonna get. And my aunt, she loves lamb, that's why we picked here and we confirmed before that they had lamb, but on her birthday, when we got there, they said there was no lamb that day, it's seasonal item. Again, it's her 90th birthday, how often does that come? That was the whole point, lamb and the cake for her. They really need to do something about their service. We spent more than a grand in there, and they almost ruined my aunts birthday. God what a disaster. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Lots of food & drink deals at the bars and restaurants, including $1 food and beer. This is an older casino and retains some of the charm of an 80 year old property. I went here a few years ago for the Pass's inaugural ""comedy nights"". I couldn't resist checking this out, and even played a little in the smoky casino.

 I gave Mom's Good Eats my first try the other day when me and my girlfriend were next door picking up an order at Retro. It's a small hole in the wall joint with no seating but something was calling our name. Good thing we went in and checked it out because it was a good find. Though I must admit we were both very skeptical at first going into a place with no seating and being that we've never eaten there we had no clue what to expect. We ended up ordering Chicken Tenders smothered in moms Sweet & Spicy Sauce with Sweet potato fries. The lady behind the counter was very friendly and the Kitchen was in plain view so you know your food is made to order. We received our food and proceeded to my car for a ""Picnic"" lol. As soon as we opened the box my sinuses immediately clear up and I couldn't wait to dig in. Chicken Fingers are one of those foods that are hard to mess up but you can really tell when a place does it well. Crispy enough on the outside with hot & moist white meat on the inside. Mom's special sauce was awesome! not too sweet not too spicy : ) As for the sweet potato's; they were absolutely to die for! I still have some places to try in town before I can say they're the best I've had but they're up there for sure! They also had some interesting stuff on there menu that I would like to try next time they stop in like Jalapeno Mac & Cheese, Teriyaki Chicken Bowl, Etc. If I didn't live all the way across town this would be the perfect place for when you're on your way home and just want something tasty because you don't feel like cooking kind of nights ; ) I'm giving Mom's Good Eats 4 stars on strength of flavor and reasonable prices. Definitely worth a try! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I came here on Sunday with my boyfriend and 5 other friends. Things got off to a bad start when our waitress spilled coke down the front of my off-white dress and all over my leather purse. I was soaked. Even my underwear was soaked. Everyone at the table was shocked but I made sure to be nice and forgiving and for every apology that she gave I tried to make her feel okay about things. I got up and helped her sop up the mess (no other employees came to her rescue) and wipe up the floor (literally on my knees scooping ice and coke up with her) and she gave me a few dish rags to try to dry myself off. At the end of the meal she brought or checks, and she said our two sodas had been taken off the bill. We were all surprised more hadn't been done to make it right. Note: Our friends had all ordered pizzas/appetizers so between the 7 of us, it would be a good sized bill. My boyfriend and I had ordered the two drinks and a large pizza. So with the sodas removed the bill came to $26. My boyfriend asked her if there was any chance half of the price of our pizza could be taken off the menu. It was uncomfortable but she said yes. When her manager, David, returned to the table he was totally abrasive. Without asking how our meal was or even coming near me to check on my dress or purse, David very hurriedly said to my boyfriend, ""Hello sir, yeah, she told me about the drinks spilling and so we took them off of your bill for the inconvenience. We'll take 5 bucks off but that's all I can do."" My boyfriend, affected by David's abrasiveness said ""We were only asking if maybe half the pizza could be covered. I think that's bull****."" And David said ""Of course you do. Sorry folks."" And walked away! Our experience felt entirely unprofessional. I was disappointed that David hadn't even come to the table to check on us immediately after the accident or during our meal. And by the way, the pizza wasn't good. Terrible experience. My boyfriend was so fired up that he went home and emailed corporate. I did feel bad for our waitress, who was very apologetic and seemed just as disappointed in David's managing skills as we were.

 This is the best place to stay if you are on a budget, or didn't book a hotel far out enough and don't want to pay $1,000,000 a night. They definitely revamped this place. PROS: The hallways are clean; the carpet looks new; the walls look redone; the rooms are clean and more modern than expected. The non-smoking DOES NOT SMELL LIKE CIGARETTES! The bathroom isn't as big, but for this price, I'll shut up. They even have flat screens TV! The people @ the check-in were really sweet. CONS: This place is kind of far from the center of the strip. Because it is one of the older hotels, it is not as fancy or hyped as the new hotels on the strip. You don't get the pretty, well-decorated check in area like the other big hotels. This place is a lot smaller. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Among Food Network viewers and celebrity-chef followers, Chef Scott Conant is bordering on household name territory these days here in the states. It's hard to miss him as he has popped up on '24 Hour Restaurant Battle', 'Top Chef', 'Chopped', and even 'No Reservations' recently. So with the crew of PizzaHunt.net firmly entrenched in Las Vegas at the International Pizza Expo, why the hell would we not want to eat some pizza at his latest endeavor located inside the brand new 'The Cosmopolitan' hotel/casino, named D.O.C.G. Enoteca. Wood-fired pizza is all the rage around the United States, make no mistake about it. However with so many folks getting into the game these days, we are beginning to see a separation between those in the know and those just pretending to know. So call us natural born skeptics every time we step foot in a wood-fired place. D.O.C.G. Enoteca is a quant place with about 20-25 tables inside the walls and another 15-20 outside. It also features a fully stocked bar with food service. The wood-fired oven is centerpiece of the dining room as it should be. You may expect the service to be on the stuffy side at a joint like this, but we found it quite the opposite. After ordering a straight margherita (with buffalo mozz) we were served an array of fresh breads and breadsticks. Nothing shocking about it, just solid and fresh. About 4 minutes later our pizza hit the table. The first thing we noticed was a little less char than we are accustomed to on wood-fired pies. (baking at about 700 degrees btw). Overall though, we were impressed with the look of the pizza. On the taste front, D.O.C.G. is nearly perfect in our eyes. They feature a buffalo mozzarella that is very creamy with a slight tartness that we loved. The sauce was clearly fresh pressed tomatos and the crust had a great spring to it while being chewy and charred. But what really tied all of this together for us was the use of sea salt on the finished product and the fresh basil. Sure, I know how this discussion goes. Customers can apply their own salt to taste, etc. In our opinion we shouldn't have to though, the chef should cook to taste and the finished product should be ready to roll, period. I think we have been fortunate enough to eat some of the better wood-fired margherita pizzas in the country and Scott Conant's D.O.C.G. Enoteca ranks pretty high. We look forward to going back...and you should too. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Eh. I'm not sure what to call it, but I feel like ""Flea Market ""is a stretch. It's a lot of resale, boots, sneakers, earrings, NFL jackets, jeggings, I was not impressed. I buzzed through the first two buildings, this place is ridiculously big for selling all of the same things. However, I did find a man selling silverware sets outside. I bought a bunch of big silver plated servings pieces for $10, out of the back of his pick up truck. So maybe this place is a hit or miss? I may venture back, but I'll avoid the buildings and just scoot around the outside area - sounds sketchy, but it'll be fine. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is not welcoming at all. Yes, I understand that it was extremely busy. It was the night of the Hudson sponsored MAGIC after party and there were a TON of people. That being said, it does not give the staff any right to be as disorganized as they were. Even though we were on Hudson's MAGIC after party VIP list, there was a lot of confusion as to where we should go and who would be walking us in instead of waiting in the 5 lines that they had going (for whatever reason). Once we got inside, the drinks were NOT strong at all but they did take amazing care of the Hudson suite/ table so that made it a little more pleasant. One thing that WAS good was that the tables were pretty inexpensive at $375 for a bottle of decent vodka. The decor was very Asian... not any particular one but just in general. Pools of water with rose petals in them, girls massaging eachother, dancers on a platform above the dance floor. It was way too hot in there and it was definitely overcrowded but it didn't seem to bother many people. The side rooms were more pleasant, but barely. Overall a lackluster club experience. I'd be willing to give it one more try but only on a quieter night.... ",0,1,0,0,0

 5 stars isn't enough! I found Angie on the internet. I relied on the reviews and left the rest up to fate. Let me just say, ""amazing!"" Angie was professional, prompt, personable, and treated my husband and I as we were the first and only couple to marry. We were married at Calico Basin and our photographer asked us if we'd be willing to take a bit of hike to the ceremony location. Angie was completely on board and hiked the dusty, rocky .5 mile - no complaints, in a suit, and with a smile! She filed our paperwork with the county and kept us posted along the way. As far as of officiating my ceremony - her words were so meaningful, loving, special, and memorable! She really speaks from the heart! I recommend Angie without hesitation. She is fabulous!

 I usually get good service, however, my family and I (on different occasions) received really poor service from one particular cashier. I don't know her name but she is a tallish brunette and works the shift around 2 pm. When I asked her about coffee flavors she didn't say a word and just pointed to the selections and when I told her what I wanted, she asked me to say it again and said I was looking at the wrong menu and gave the most fake laugh, like she was mocking me. To top it all off, she nearly broke my credit card when she swipt it. This woman clearly had no respect for me as a customer.

 Honestly, the worst pedicure I can remember. I rarely leave negative reviews, but I'm shocked at how bad the actual pedicure was. I don't care about how nice the place was when I need to get a new pedicure today to clean up their mess. Besides not giving me any time to allow my toes to dry before asking me to get up (and they're smudged), they flew through the pedicure, no cleaning up of any skin, bleeding cuticles from rough filing and burned me with the hot towel. I hate to be negative but it bothers me how sloppy this was. ",1,0,0,0,0

 OVER FRIKKIN RATED. So we had to wait in line for over an hour (cuz we had our BFs with us) while we watched countless hootchie mamas stroll right to the front of the line to get in. My girls and I could've easily ditched the BFs and get in while THEY waited in that horrendous line... LOL... but of course we didn't. On top of that, when we got in line they said it was going to be a $20 cover charge, so we say ""OK, not bad"" and stay. But when we finally get to the booth, they drop a bomb on us and tell us its $40.... EACH. WTF? And for some stupid reason we actually paid that shit.... I think it was because we had waited in line all that damn time and we didn't want it to be for nothing. But a big FUCK YOU goes out to you Pure Night Club for lying and jacking up the prices at the last minute. Ridiculously steep prices on drinks, even a bottled water would set you back almost $10. Uhh, no thanks. Highlight of the night was that we saw Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock while we were in line. *see pics* ",0,1,0,0,0

 I never liked eating crab or lobster because I thought it was too much work, but Joe's has changed EVERYTHING. I was so full from the bread basket, oysters, lobster, and stone crabs -- and that was just our appetizers. We also got the clam chowder, which is tomato based FYI, the seafood salad was a surprising portion and very light. For my entree, I got the dover's tail special (?). I might have spelt that wrong but everything was delicious. So delicious - I didn't have room for dessert which is absolutely ridiculous for me. Service and food are exceptional -- and it puts quite a dent in your wallet. Without a doubt worth it. I would definitely come back to Joe's EVERY time I am in Vegas now. Next time though, I'll order dessert FIRST. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Where to start? Perhaps Greece? That is my recommendation to Niro. I think because this family restaurant is located in the dessert, there is a belief that locals have nothing to compare it to as you would in Chicago, New York, or Philly. If this place was in one of those cities, would they stand out? Sadly no. But, when we consider it being in Ahwahtukee, we give some grace . Diaspora longing for their ethnic fix of packed pita pockets plump with processed lamb and beef, prepared possibly by expats of any part of the world...will be pleased. But let me throw this in. There is no seen evidence by Niro to be anything but an iconic representation of what a Greek fast food place would be like run by someone not Greek would be like. It saddened me for example to not see fries done as they do in Greece, and salads without tomatoes and cucumbers (mostly lettuce) and not even the occasional greek song playing on the sound system. Still, Niro did pack my sandwich with meat. That deserves distinction. If they would also not be sparing with the sauce, it would be much better. I purchased more for $0.60. I am not sure what the extra cost is to get the sandwich hot. Mine was actually cold. But I ate it quietly thinking about how I might be able to make a return trip and not expect more. Can I?

 First off, this place is just a really cool looking restaurant. Really pretty and well-decorated, with a modern-Asian flair. I lovelovelove sushi, and since we don't really have any in our little Idaho college town, I was very excited when I saw a sushi restaurant right below our hotel room. The husband got some egg drop soup since he wasn't feeling well (don't eat at the Pyramid Cafe!) and it was quite good. A little pricey for a bowl of soup, but good. I got the Wicked and Wall Eye Knee rolls. They were also pretty dang good. Not the most amazing sushi I've ever had, but pretty solid, still. Only slightly more expensive than sushi at non-Vegas venues, which isn't bad. Our total bill for the soup and 2 rolls was $38. Service was very attentive but not annoying. My water glass was always full and when we needed a box and the bill pretty early since the Husband was sick, they were quick and understanding. Overall, if you're looking for a good dinner with a nice atmosphere, Rice & Company is a good bet. I would go back again! ",0,0,0,1,0

 You know, I really love the food here, but had the worst service ever tonight. I don't know if it was based on age, being a young adult, or out of pure laziness on the server'a behalf, but she never asked how our food was or if we wanted more bread. The only time she came over is when we had to call her over and then when she came over and said ""do you want me to split the check?"" And then put it on the table, without asking if we even wanted dessert. I mean, being the unruly teenagers we obviously are, we don't have money to spend on dessert.

 Great little place to grab some yummy food! They serve breakfast style waffles, lunch style waffles and smoothies!

There was one waffle, sausage, eggs, and a cup of coffee. My boyfriend ordered the waffle ham sandwich that came with hash browns. They were both delicious! Very clean and friendly environment. They had today's top hits playing on the radio and the news on the tv. The staff was great and the service was very quick! I will be returning here often. Extremely pleased with this find!

 Came here on a busy night. Took our waiter 20 minutes to actually acknowledge us. Then, took almost another 15 minutes just to get our drink. And the worst part was that it took nearly an entire hour for us to get our food and nobody who worked there checked up on us. Poor customer service? yes. I understand, that at times, it can be very busy, but to not check up on your customers is very rude. When we finally received our food, my burger was very soggy. The buns were wet.

 Gross. I-mart has now expanded to include a restaurant just a few doors down from the market. Wise decision, because the market part smells whack. It is pretty obvious and common knowledge that they cut their meat in the back of the store. I suppose the market and restaurant deserve their own review, but I think its the same rating, I'll just merge them. The market has your basic Indo-Pak foods. Don't confuse the owner for an Indian or Paki though, he's from Bangladesh. He's an extremely nice guy, but I feel like every since he moved from Tempe, near ASU, his store has just lost substance. If you need to buy substantial amounts of halal meat I suggest you go elsewhere, probably Baiz Market would be a good idea. The meat here is very inconsistent. He's got your basic Shan masala amongst other odd brands. Of course he has asian rice and everything else you'd really expect from this type of store. The mango juices he stocks are weird, but he has some Pakistani soda, Pakola. That's pretty cool. The restaurant should be avoided. My fellow Indo-Pak friends rave about this place all the time, but I don't think they know any better. I walked in and the owner was taking orders... I was slightly confused and surprised (today was the first time I went to the restaurant). I thought to myself, ""Hey man, he's usually at the store cuttin' my meat, what the heck is he doing here?"" He must have made the food, because when he disappeared again he didn't reappear until my food was ready. My friends had bought me a tandoori chicken wrap, I'm being very ungrateful, but it was not enjoyable at all. The naan was obviously microwaved a few seconds too long, because by the time I got to it it was like chewing on plastic. Taking bites out my 'wrap' was just painful. I'm sad because the filling was actually pretty good, but how can you overmicrowave naan to that point? It's like overmicrowaving your hotpocket (just follow the damn directions). The owner clearly wants to retire soon, he first moved from the ASU location to a much smaller store, and now he is barely focusing on the store. To make things worse, he decided to open up a restaurant. If you could compare this place to a legit Indo-pak restaurant, it'd be something like comparing Filiberto's to Chipotle. Everyone likes Chipotle, but only some people can stand Filiberto's. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I cannot rave ENOUGH about Jeff. I have an older home, and it was drafty as could be. I also have a twelve foot, all glass, sliding glass door with two panes, and of course, the day we move it, it got broken. I had four estimators come out to replace the glass door, then all the rest of the windows. Jeff's estimate beat all others by several thousand dollars with the exact same brand of windows as his competitors. I had the door and two windows replaced first. Walter and his partner came out and in a matter of hours, not only did much of the draft stop, but I have a strong, draft proof, tempered glass sliding doors, plus gorgeous draft-free windows. When they had to drill out my stucco to fit the doors and windows properly, they also repaired all the spots, and cleaned up the trash. I literally had two windows out and a twelve foot hole in my kitchen wall at 9 a.m., and had an open house at 4. It was that efficient. He now is replacing a door with a high security top of the line door, in a price that was incredibly reasonable, and the rest of this summer, I'm having Jeff do all of my windows. Incredible service, great prices, solid work team isn't some subcontractor hired out of a rolodex to install a window. If you'd like photos of his work, please see his website or contact me on yelp!

 I've had excellent meals at another location, so I stopped by this location recently when I was nearby. The order takers were young and looked bored/unenthused. Loud and at times offensive dance music was being played through the house speakers. When an order was ready, the server didn't have a very loud voice and often looked frustrated that nobody could hear her call out the names. When my food finally arrived (the spicy chicken plate) the chicken had been overcooked and spiced unevenly. The noodles were good, and so were the vegetables -- still a good value for your money considering the quantity of food -- but this is not the place to have a quality relaxing meal. Overall it reminded me of a high school cafeteria with dance music. I will eat at the other location if I want this food again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'd guess that 3/4 or more of this place's business is to visitors from Hawaii. Strangely, ""Big Island"" beef jerky is made in Vegas and brought back to Hawaii. What was a little odd this time was that there were new varieties of cookies and fewer choices of beef jerky. No more 1 pound bags of anything. But maybe it's because of beef prices these days. The shortbread cookies and bagel chips are legendary for those who have sweet tooths. So easy to spend $50 (or more - way more) here so be sure to stop by close to the end of your trip if you're on a budget. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I'm a big Chompie's fan. I eat at their Tempe, and Shea location on the occasion and am usually very content with the food. Chompie's is true to the authentic New Yorker. I, personally, never lived in New York, but my sister and brother-in-law lived there for over 10 years and say that Chompie's hold true to the mentality and tradition. Their matzo ball soup is delicious. I love their Brooklyner, and the Club. Their breakfast skillets are top-notch, and they have courteous servers. This most recent trip I went in and had an odd request. My jaw is currently fractured and I can't chew. I asked if they could blend my matzo ball chicken noodle soup and bring it out to me. The waitress was so helpful and told me it wouldn't be a problem. When they brought it out it was all liquified, and it was WONDERFUL! It still had all the flavors of the soup, and the puree that I had in front of me was perfect for my jaw. I was so appreciative that they would take the time to do that for me while I can't chew right now. And to the waitress it was so nonchalant, I never felt like I was imposing that request on her. I am definitely a fan! When you go, make sure to check out their bread items (bagels), and the HUGE assortment of sweets. They have a great collection of cookies, tarts, cakes, all for sale - and they're really good too! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I live here in Vegas but had friends coming into town and wanted to stay on the strip with them without spending the fortune the other hotels wanted. I was able to book this with my Hilton Honors points. I have to preface this with saying that I am a Diamond Member with Hilton so that might have factored into the room I received. I don't know if they are all similar to what I had but my room, (or suite would be a better word) was amazing. My friends were staying across the street at the Belagio and they wanted to switch hotels after seeing my room. I was only staying for the night but if I was staying for more nights the fully stocked kitchen would have been very helpful. The bathroom came equipped with everything you would need including a few extra touches such as a shaving mirror in the shower and a washer/dryer combo hidden in one of the cabinets we just happen to find. Once again, the hot tub/bath tub would have been incredible if I had known and was there longer but wasn't able to use it this time. As was the full wall projection TV. We went up just to drop off everyone's stuff and ended up spending a good hour and a half checking out all of the features in the room. The bar down stairs was nice and relaxing without the typical casino surroundings, but the Planet Hollywood casino was a quick walk through the mall away. And for those that don't know where the Elara is located, it's attached to the Miracle Mile (Planet Hollywood Casino) mall just off the strip across from City Center. it's right in the middle of the strip. Great location. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Oh so delicious!! Our friends brought us here and I'm so thankful! The service here was on point! Our waiter was so informative and helpful. Drinks didn't go empty and he did it all with a smile! Awesome! Now for the food - with my 5 star review you should guess how much we loved it. The Quattro Formaggi pizza was wonderful topped with fontina, Gorgonzola, mozzarella and parmigiano reggiano. We also tried the basil pesto pizza topped with strips of pancetta. This was my favorite! The perfect balance of toppings gave this pizza top prize! It's easy to fall in love with this pizza place.

 My grandma made pancakes very similar to these but added a little buckwheat. I can't duplicate her recipe but the cooking style is to fry the pancakes in a little oil or butter so they get a crispy edge. A bonus is if an edge fries then more batter seeps over to create a double crispy edge. I would assume the pies and pastries are the same as the ones in LA, of which the boysenberry is very good and difficult to find anywhere else. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We stayed at The Trump in August 2011. I don't even know where to begin with how much we loved this hotel! We chose Trump because we have children and didn't want to be in a casino hotel. This was far enough from the strip, but not too far. It turned out to be the perfect location for us. Everyone at Trump was extremely friendly and accomodating. From the moment we pulled up, until it was time for check-out we were greeted with professional, smiling staff. The room was clean and comfortable. We had birthday cookies and a pitcher of cold milk sent to our room for our daughter and they were big, warm, and DELICIOUS! The bed was so comfortable I layed down and was instantly asleep. I think that's the first time I've slept without tossing and turning in years! While the main bed was fantastic, the pull-out sofa bed was horrible. That thing was super uncomfortable, even for the kids! That's the only improvement they could make to the room and if you aren't using the sofa bed, you're going to love it there! ",0,0,0,1,0

 For many years, I was resistant to the idea of fish tacos. Little did I know what I was missing! 8 years ago, I decided to try them at Rubio's and I've never looked back!

 I was in the mall today running some errands and decided to give Rubio's a try. It was just okay. I had the grilled chicken soft taco with chipolte cream sauce and avocado and it was pretty good. The flavor of the chicken was just so so but the chipolte cream added to the flavor quite a bit. They do have a salsa bar at this location in the mall but it is not the greatest. The mild is a bit watery and has way to much cilantro and the picante is way to peppery. The only salsa I really enjoyed was the chipolte salsa which really complemented the grilled chicken taco. I might try Rubio's again if the mood struck me but it is not somewhere that I would seek out specifically. Not that there are many other great options in the Chandler Mall food court. It's just okay. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Stopped by the conservatory at the Bellagio today and the summer garden is super cool. Loved the bees and umbrellas hanging from the ceilings and the flowers were very beautiful. They change this out for each season, so not sure how long this one will be up, but if you're in Vegas, you should try to stop by to see what the current theme and design is. It's super close to the parking garage elevators and even if you're not staying around the Bellagio for anything else, it's an easy in and out and it really is something to see. I haven't been at night, but during the day it's quite pretty and they have a really great selection of flowers and plants. WHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET FIVE STARS? This is tricky because it is very beautiful and the fact that they change it fairly regularly is awesome, but this was my first visit so I've only seen the one design. I've seen gardens all over the world and while I loved this it was small and it didn't blow me away. Maybe I need to see it a few more times to call it as good as it gets. I'll let you know the next time I visit. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Worst International Airport in the United States. And I've been traveling for three decades. What makes it horrible is anytime you have a connecting flight you must do two horrible, extremely inefficient things: 1.) Walk half a mile (I'm not exaggerating) to get to the domestic main terminals - with very limited moving platforms. It's so complicated and looong that they have people in purple to guide you as you carry your luggage for 20 minutes while your back and hands are in pain. Other airports have trams and buses near the customs/terminal areas to make it simple and fast. 2.) You have to go through the whole security checkpoint again, despite doing it at your previous destination / layovers. What airport does this? Ridiculous. The only good side is the people are friendly (but part of that is because they have a ton of staff to guide you through your 1 hour journey from terminal to your next airline). If you must, remember to bring a redbull and do some stretches. It'll be a looooong way for your connecting flight if you travel international to domestic. Worst airport in America for efficiency.

 I was seriously considering giving this a 1 star rating, because I feel a two star rating is too generous. This is a Long John Silver / A&W multi branded restaurant. I am reviewing only the Long John Silver side of this business. Long John Silver's have been running a TV campaign promoting their Freshside Grille menu items. A friend from work and I decided to give it a try. I ordered the Grilled Pacific Salmon Platter and a medium drink and that came to $10.36. The Salmon portion was small, but I will admit, it tasted very good. The failure of this place came from the corn-on-the-cob that tasted like it had been boiled for 3 days and vegetables that were not warm. The soda fountain was a mess, and the tables were all dirty. We had to select the ""least dirty"" table to eat our meal. I don't recommend it place at all. There are plenty of fast food restaurants in the area and you don't need to settle for this. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Without a doubt the best phockin pho in the SW neighborhood. Their broth is consistently fresh and delicious. The ingredients are fresh and they give a generous amount of thai basil. They have a nice variety on the menu, but my favorite is the #14 Special Rainbow Pho and the egg rolls. The egg rolls come with fresh mint, which is so good. The service is fast & efficient. I almost always do carry out, but if you do eat in, their chili garlic sauce is fantastic. It's the lighter red sauce of the 2 jars on the table. They have a drive thru, but I recommend calling ahead and when you go to pick up give them a call to let them know that you are at the window to pick up. If you're sick or suffering from a hang over, this is a must have. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I have a 2010 Beetlebug Convertible with less than 50,000 miles on it. The checkstrap that keeps the door from flying open and holds it opened snapped. The weld broke. Now it is causing damage to the interior of the door. The body shop originally said $150.00 but now I need a entire new door because the part is welded inside the door. Price $2000.00 my warranty is good until 9/2015 or 60k miles. Findlay will not cover the cost nor will VW of America. This is a part that you rarely see being faulty and breaking. I've had vehicles with 150k miles on it and that never happened and this car has less use than the previous vehicles. Findlay does not stand behind their vehicles or warranty. I've been happy with my VW until now, but knowing the way they take care of their customers with a faulty part, I will never buy another VW and you should be careful if you're considering it. I have another girlfriend who had major issues with Vw also. I'm the one that referred her to VW and then she gets a lemon.

 My friends and I wound up eating here 3 days in a row because we were staying in the hotel and everything was comped for us, so I'm not exactly sure of the price. I think it was around $35 for dinner which I did not think was fair because their selection was so small. I would say that there are much better buffets on the strip but Aria buffet is still better than the really bad ones like Ceaser's Palace's buffet. But still I've had better food at buffets off the strip. It is very fancy though, we were each served wine and half of a lobster which was fine but I was bothered by the black clumps that were not cleaned from our lobsters. It's a nice restaurant but it is still typical for a buffet. I can't say anything was memorable about this place other than the decor.

 I have heard many things about Korean Fried Chicken... ""life changing"", ""orgasmic"", ""so good it will make you drop kick your mother, twice""...and ""jolly good!"" That being said, I was not the least bit recalcitrant to visit this new entrant into the Pittsburgh food scene, when it was brought to my attention by Maren V. Venturing back into the proverbial ""old stomping grounds"" of the University of Pittsburgh, and navigating the myriad of Sperry wearing, sweatpants clad undergrads, we entered the small and crowded establishment. Following a not so brief wait, we placed an order for soy garlic wings. We were informed, there were no drumsticks available. Tears. The order was delivered in a respectably prompt fashion. As a bonus, they had finger condoms ( is there a better name for these things?) if you are a Monk-esque having two hands dirty at the same time-a phobe, like myself. Lets get to the wings, shall we? The first bites for a KFC virgin such as myself were confusing to say the least. I had heard these were to be double fried, and crispy, yet tender. I detected no difference to regular chicken wings to be honest. The sauce was almost sickeningly sweet, yet lacking in any subtle distinction of flavor. Some were crispy, some were almost soggy. In all honesty, I threw about 8 away. I never throw food away. I generally eat everyone elses leftovers because I am fat as f***. I might chalk it up to being extremely busy, but I really dont have desires to give a second chance. I must find KFC elsewhere. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I would give the chocolate 5 stars and the regular food 2 stars, so I ended up with 3 for my overall review. I got a butterscotch shake that was DIVINE! When we were ordering our lunch food, the waitress boasts to us that she has never had complaints about the food ever. That was a bad sign. Turns out we were her ""first ever"" complaints. Or so she said. A few of us ordered the Max Brenner burger. We requested medium when asked how we want them cooked. I ended up with a super dry burger that was charred on the outside. I should have shelled out the extra $2 for the kobe beef because my friend said that although hers was overcooked, it was still juicy. Mine was completely devoid of juiciness. The waitress did comp one of the burgers when my friend complained, but I can't imagine she would have comped them all, so I stayed silent. I was so full from the shake that I didn't bother finishing my burger. Also, the BBQ sauce is non-existant on the burger, so make sure to request extra. So disappointing for a $15 burger!

 I am a happy camper since there is finally a wing place in the area. Awesome concept for Wing Stop, definitely trying to put that competitive edge to BWW. The inside is smaller than what is looks from the outside, but still pretty spacious with bar and dinning area. I ordered the boneless with buffalo and Parmesan garlic and side of Cajun fries. The buffalo was pretty standard, but from other Wing Stops I've had in the past this Parmesan garlic was just okay. The seasoning on the fries was rather strong and almost not good. As much as I want to like the food here I can't exactly say it was good and I'd come back again and again. Although I did have some left overs which tasted better the next day?! Kind of funny I thought. I will give them a few months to work out the kinks and hopefully the food comes out better. I for sure will order the wings since wings are always better than boneless anyway. On the plus side service is good as other Yelpers mentioned. ",0,0,1,0,0

 After seeing all the raving reviews, I was really looking forward to trying the buffet at Bellagio but in the end, I was a bit disappointed. Shrimp cocktail was awesome as well as some of the other seafood selections, but a lot of meat dishes were overcooked, dry, and tough. Good pasta and pizza, but I try to limit my carb consumption at buffets so that I can eat more and get my $$ worth. Now on to desserts. My friends and I tried little bit of everything, there was really no wow factor. Everything was a bit bland, even flan and tiramisu. Come'on, how can you ever go wrong with flan and tiramisu? The best ones were chocolate eclair and bread pudding, but not good enough to go get seconds. Considering that I came here after not eating for good ~20 hours, I should have enjoyed the food more than usual but unfortunately, that was not the case.

Us sitting and constantly flagging the server down for things we needed cause he never stop by on his own. 2nd visit was more of the same...had to ask multiple times for anything we wanted.

The folks at Phoenix Sky Harbor Enterprise, however, really went above and beyond for me, ensuring my repeat business and glowing recommendation. My guy and I decided to rent a compact to do our annual trek back to the midwest for the holidays, so I showed up at the Enterprise kiosk with a vague notion of a tiny, tin can, extremely poor traction for the snow we'd be sure to encounter car. After greeting me and asking a few questions about our trip, employee and manager-in-training Ben. H. guided me towards an Elantra. I can't get over this, you guys- he listened to me while I was talking, processed what I was saying, and then responded to my concerns by considering what he had in stock and picking something that addressed those concerns specifically. Plus, the car had satellite radio as a free bonus. How often does that happen in retail?! The car was great. We drove through an actual blizzard and loaded the poor thing down with presents, food and items from home to the very brim, AND we literally doubled the miles on it by the time I drove it back. My darling grandmother also gave me a few gallons of sauerkraut to bring home... which cracked during the trip and proceeded to leak smelly, fermented cabbage juice aaaaall over the backseat. When I returned the car it was salt-encrusted both inside and out (they sprinkle salt on the streets back east to help melt the snow... which then sticks to your boots as you get into your vehicle) the odometer had more than doubled, and there was still a massive sauerkraut stain. I'd also prepaid for a tank of gas, then returned the car with 9/10ths of a tank in it. Ben H. recognized me immediately (surprise number one) and then asked, completely sincerely, how my holidays were. There was no slick talk behind his question, he actually paused and looked at me, waiting for my response before telling me how to pay for the vehicle. (Surprise number two). And when I got to the embarrassing admittance that there was sour cabbage water all over my rental car, he not only told me they could take care of it and would not be charging me, he also noted the gas gauge and issued me a refund for the tank of gas! Whoa! Ben. H. and Enterprise Rental Car of Sky Harbor, you have convinced me that customer service is not dead- and more importantly, neither is human interaction. I can't wait for our next road trip- thank you! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I came in on a Sunday (with a reservation) during Grand Prix weekend not knowing more than a few phrases in French, and was greeted with friendly faces in red dresses who happily showed me to my seat and offered recommendations upon request. The porcini-crusted cod is as wonderful as others say it is, but perhaps even more fantastic was the octopus ""salad"" that had no greens, but hummus, red onions, shallots and capers instead. At the end of the night, it was a fig cake & sweet potato ice cream that was so delicious, I just had to order a coffee to sip while I soaked up the atmosphere. ",0,0,0,0,1

 If you are looking for good Vietnamese cuisine in the Pittsburgh area, I highly recommend this restaurant. Visiting from NY, we took our daughter (who attends college here) and a few of her friends. We had reservations for 7:30 but the people at the table they had intended for us were apparently lingering a LONG time. So, while we had to wait close to 30 mins, the staff were very attentive, apologetic and nice; they managed to set up a special table for us and they also gave us complimentary desserts! The food here was very good - better than many places in NY - and it was casual but with a very warm ambience. A few people had the soup (pho), which got good reviews, the steamed dumplings were excellent, and the bun that I had was very good. It's refreshing (based on my experience in the Burgh) to find a place where you ask for the food spicy . . . and they actually make it spicy! Good job. The crepe dish was deep fried but very good and not overly greasy. Interestingly, we had stopped by the evening before for take-out, and they said it would be an hour wait - seriously? for take-out?? A place like this would never survive in NYC, but hopefully it will here because it is a real gem! Just goes to show - if you serve great food and are good natured, people will be very forgiving of miscues. I am sure we will be back! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I had several people tell me they really love Firehouse subs so I went to check it out. The sandwiches my son and I got were decent. Nothing special, nothing really flavorful, Just OK. As mentioned in other reviews, the moral and employees are just there. They have zero personality. I don't care to have any real conversation with the person ringing me up or making my sandwich but when you are trying to be a better alternative than Subway, Port of Subs, Quiznos, try to at least fake that you want to be there. I liked that they have a big selection of different hot sauces. That was a plus, too bad I had to add plenty to make my sandwich have more flavor. I don't drink soda all that often but they have one of those build your own coke machines and that is also a nice addition to Firehouse Subs. If the sandwiches had better and or more flavor it would help this place stand out more. With no personality service and just Decent sandwiches, I found it very forgettable and have no desire to try it again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Buyer beware. Total rip off. Poor service, sub par food. And a surprise bill! I have never taken the time out write a bad review, but this place was so bad I had to. Hopefully others will not go through the horrible experience my party and I went through. I recently hosted a family Christmas party at India Beau village. I rented the hall and had the food catered by the restaurant. All payments were agreed prior to the event and I left a sizable deposit. The day of the event they increased the amount and asked if I could pay cash. At the end of the night they increased the amount even more and then said they would charge the taxes. As angry as I was. I just paid them so I could get the hell out of there. Meanwhile the food was sub par by far. I later found out 3 of my guest complained of suffering from gastro. The service was rude and slow. They kicked us out at 2am when they previously said we could stay till 3am. All in all a very bad time had by all. I will never go back there!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Oh F&E - how you have broken my heart! This was my favorite place to shop for the past year. After being taken over by another grocery store chain, the store has gone downhill. From higher prices on almost everything in the store (the dinners I used to purchase for weekly dinners went up on average $1 per! It's a meal under 300 calories - there's hardly any food in the bow! How can you justify that increase!) The quality of the produce is now shockingly bad. I used to be able to have fresh bananas and spinach last all week - not now. The bananas are brown and spotted and questionable by Wednesday. And finally, today I purchased a bean and cheese dish and apparently someone forgot to add cheese! Ugh. Like I said, I used to love this store! This was my main grocery store and I purchased 5 nights of dinners for me and my boyfriend. Not anymore. Time to find a new store. I will say that despite all the changes, the employees still remain the most helpful an friendly of any store you can shop at. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Second time through yesterday... Down grading my review. There is nothing that stands out to make this place better than just another burger. I ordered with different toppings. Stayed simple with Bacon, mushrooms, and of course jalapenos.. Order fries and a drink. $12.00.. It was just a burger. It was o.k. but not worth the $12.00 price. Honestly, Wendy's goes down better for me. Fries are just not doing it for me. I ordered regular. Added lot's of salt and ketchup and that helped. It must be a taste thing, I just like my fries crispy. I would still go back if in the area and wanting a burger. But will also favor the In & Out or other places if I am going that direction instead. ",0,1,0,0,0

 What's not 2 like about a home~cooked meal in nice cabin~style atmosphere? Upon entering this establishment a 1derful combin8ion of smells welcomes ur senses w/ warm inviting outdoorsy earthy tones that makes u wanna get comfortable & stay awhile. We were promptly greeted then seated by the pleasant hostess @ a nice cushy booth where we acticip8ed viewing all the options 2 select from. I've been here a couple of Xs once 4 breakfast & another 4 lunch. Our friendly w8tress who greeted us took our drink orders filling us in on the specials, leaving us more time 2 decipher what we wanted 2 go w/. I finally decided 2 start w/ a breakfast pastry called a cherry bear~claw which certainly didn't disappoint, then a vegetarian omelette w/ sliced avocado on top ~ fresh quality & complimentary ingredients that made my taste~buds sing. I've also had the oh~so~YUMMY California Benedict (minus the bacon) which is an English Muffin w/ spinach, grilled tomato, avocado, 2 poached eggs smothered in hollandaise sauce, fluffy biscuits & flavorful gravy, cinnamon roll french toast, sweet cream waffle/pancakes ~ all which were golden Perfection & sweetness (of course u can always go overboard w/ the syrup if u choose, but it's the Good stuff ~ no artificial fake nasty after~taste sweeteners here)... My personal Fave is the Harvest Tossed Salad which has dried cranberry, cherry, blueberry, golden raisin, mushroom, bell pepper, onion, almond, walnut & pecan in a lite honey Dijon dressing topped w/ fresh strawberries/toasted coconut & will always make room 4 their delectable signature secret recipe home~made bread pudding w/ pecan praline sauce!! Sorry if this makes u saliv8 but this is my sampling of an Amazing place w/ Awesome food complete w/ Gr8 service/atmosphere @ a very reasonable cost 2 boot & find myself thinking often of going back more than I get 2...

 We heard about this place from Yelp, and decided to check it out today. It's located in a strip mall close to ASU and the light rail, and is quite affordable, so I guess it's really popular with students. It's a largish restaurant, really casual---so much so that you can sit wherever you want, no hostess seating. The menu had plenty of vegetarian and vegan options, but we went for the meat lovers combo and creamy chicken curry. We asked for shrimp instead of chicken in the last one. The food arrive in about 10 minutes, and was delicious. We wanted to share the food, and the server said if we had informed them earlier, they would have divided the portions into two different plates! Plus points to them for being so cool! The injeras were really filling, and we mopped up the spicy vegetables, lentils, beef curry and chicken served in the meat lovers combo. Two of us couldn't finish the whole thing, so we just got a box to go. I would have given them five stars but their menu did not have any fish items. I'd had Ethiopian food in Los Angeles, and simply loved the grilled fish we'd ordered, and I was looking forward to order that here, but it was missing from the menu. But I'm definitely coming back here for more. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I actually watched the Food Network show Cupcake Wars, (Their team was memorable...and burned a pan of okra on the show, and set a small grease fire!) and didn't realize the winners, Cupcrazed was local, until they showed up at my workplace with a dozen mini cupcakes. I nommed one, and was hooked. It was the most moist, buttery, flavorful cupcake I had ever eaten. MARGARITA in a cake? Brills! So today, my husband and I made the 25 minute trek to Fort Mill to try the real deal. Some CCz'd diehards...please don't hurt me when I say some flavors were extremely dry, crumbly and impossible to pick up with a fork. We had the cookies and creme cupcake on a recommendation, and the flavor was DY-NO-MITE. It tasted just like an Oreo cookie sundae. The frosting, dead on for the Oreo filling. But the cake...oh dear. We also got the 24 Karat, which is a carrot cake, but with coconut, walnuts and raisins. THIS CAKE IS TO DIE FOR. That moistness was back, and the flavor, bursting with each bite. There is a lot of frosting on this cupcake, but my husband ate the rest of what I didn't eat. TIP: They sell cartons of milk and other drinks...very important to the cupcake experience! CC #3: Butter Rum Toffee. The frosting is deliciously buttery and sweet, but again, the cake, was...not as dry as the cookies and cream, but it tasted as if the cake had been sitting out all day. We went at about 2:30pm, and it was the 2nd to last BRT cupcake in the case, so maybe it just fell victim to being out in the open too long? CC#4: Vanilla on Vanilla. Same as BRT. Clear vanilla taste in the cake and frosting, but slightly dry. Have had better. CC#5: Double Chocolate: Dense and super chocolaty-- this was moist and brownie-like, but still doesn't beat the 24 Karat! Bottom Line: The setting is friendly and homey, with bright colored wooden tables and wooden chairs with wicker seats. Lots of kids around, lots of options. I'd get the cupcakes fresh as soon as they come out of the kitchen, or know which flavors are known for being moist. When you get a good one, Cupcrazed knocks it outta the park. TIP: Mini cupcakes (in egg cartons) are $15 a dozen (When we were there today, it was bacon maple, mmm.) and there was one lone giant cupcake, which was $5. One day I will have to try a ""push pop""-- which I'm told is like the old-school kids push pops (think, Flintstones sherbet!) but with cake and frosting layers in a clear tube! ",0,0,0,1,0

 its like stepping into an attic and there's a ghost (not casper) waiting to greet you.. while the decor is awesome, the place feels dead! there's literally no life/soul with everyone on their laptop typing away and those who are eating with friends are making their best mime impression. you could hear crickets! anyway, i was here to continue my coffee passport and got a hot chocolate as i wasn't in the mood for coffee. the hot chocolate is actually unsweetened hot chocolate which is the 2nd time i encounter such offering. as for taste, after having tried the awesomely hot chocolate, shot version at some other place, everything else is simply underwhelming. i didn't try the food as i just ate and the place was full packed so where does one sit in this coldish weather? place is pretty popular but its not my kind of place ",0,0,1,0,0

 Extremely overpriced for what you get. You end up paying nearly $50 if you get bottomless mimosas. That really isn't as great as it sounds. I'm sure their dinner is better. But their lunch selection is not all that special. Maybe it's because they serve a lot of breakfast foods, and I'm not a huge fan of those types of food. Their banana hazelnut toast was interesting and fresh, but a huge portion to say the least. Their omelets were fresh and made to serve so you can customize it in which ever way you'd like. I'd say my favorite entree there would be the bleu cheese pasta. But that was about it. Their soups were boring, salmon was dry, and chicken skewers looked cool but were really just cold and tough. I just felt like it was a dressed up hometown buffet.. nothing special. I probably could've done more with that $50 out on the floor of the casino because I didn't have much of an appetite for their food. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Teriyaki Madness is a great option for quick and healthy meal. I got the chicken teriyaki bowl (medium spicy) and added steamed vegetables for a buck more.

 The sub itself is pretty awesome. We got a 12inch Italian. The only complaint is that the employees leave the back door open and as you walk in you can see them smoking. I'm not the type of person to get mad over people smoking... it's just when you're about to prepare my food and I can see you rushing to finish your cigarette before you fix my sandwich. It's kind of gross.. Tip for Firehouse: If your employees are going to smoke make sure the customers can't see them before they walk in. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The food was pretty decent and tasty, but the service and organization were horrible...we were given chips & salsa to start, but there were NO plates...salsa ended up dripping all over the table. Then our drinks (just soft drinks) took forever, although there were only around 4 tables occupied. My husband ordered soup, which arrived only after reminding the waitress (where was she with hardly any patrons and 2-3 severs?), who then brought soup with NO SPOON...then she didn't bother checking back with us, so my husband was eating the thick soup with his fork for quite awhile. Drink refills were only provided (sometimes) upon request, and then also took forever. Lots of dry glasses and thirsty people. I asked for no beans (explaining to the server how much I detest them) on my tacos, and when the meal finally came, she said it took awhile because the kitchen accidentally added the refried beans. I trusted that she had them redo the meal, but in the middle of eating my taco, I saw that the meal had been replated but that the beans were still stuck to the bottom of the taco shell...GROSS! I had just about enough of the poor service and was expecting them to at least apologize for forgetting the soup and the spoon until my husband was nearly done with his meal, but to my chagrin, they didn't seem to care. As I said, the food was okay, even tasty, but the service absolutely ruined it; I can excuse a mistake or an omission with no problem, but the lack of concern for their comedy of errors was inexcusable. Never going back...and really think they only deserved one star... ",0,1,0,0,0

 $8 for popcorn. That is not right. Seriously I can't order a smaller size. I would rather go to a regular theater and not be bothered by the inattentive server, the people eating noisily with fork and knife around me, and the light that is so bright next to my side that it is distracting. Blah!! I think I am most upset about the popcorn. The food is average and over priced and the whole serving people with in a movie is really not a great idea. I like many other Americans appreciate value and good deals. The amc esplanade offers neither when it comes to food at least. If you are going to pay $9 for some potato skins at least make them really good. They were actually ok but the whole experience leaves a sour taste. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Cons- Long wait with terrible service. The waitresses have way too many tables and don't check on you enough. After we were seated we waited 15 mins to order. After we ordered we waited 20 mins for our milkshakes and we were supposed to have fries with them. They brought the milkshakes without the fries and forgot the spoon with the milkshake. We had to wait another 10 mins to get our spoon, no joke. After about 40 mins we got our burgers. They brought the fries out when we were half way though our burgers. They also forgot to put the sauce on my girlfriends burger so we had to ask for it. More waiting. Verdict. Service ruined everything. Fries and burger were pretty good though not worth the time we waited to be seated and definitely not worth the horrible service. The milkshakes were fake tasting and not worth the price. The pudding was a nice touch but the fake flavor was unbearable. I will never go back and would not recommend to anyone. Not like Chef Ramsey gives a shit, he doesn't cook at any of these places he just slaps his name on it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Aside from the few friends I have who work else where, Moka has the best staff as far as coffee shops go. They're so nice! Good job hiring some of the best people in the city! Ok, so I have to mention this tiny thing that is probably insignificant to most people. They put a cutesy little sticker on the hole of your lid every single time. They change them frequently and have a small variety at any given time. They are so adorable. I have no idea why it makes me so happy, but it does. I love randomly sticking them places. I had a peppermint one from the holiday season stuck on the pack of my boyfriend's pillow until a month or so ago. Anyway, me being weird aside, their coffee is pretty good. There's some taste to it that makes me not like it as much as other people's, but it isn't enough to deter me. I just can't have it a lot in a short period of time. On the plus side, the frequently change up their specialty flavors. I love trying new ones. I've yet to have a bad one. Their prices aren't bad either. At least not compared to other stores. They also offer HUGE sizes which is fantastic for road trips. I can get a giant coffee and it'll last me a few hours. It's great. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was panning in the wild Wild West and stumbled upon this hidden gem. Instead of finding gold that I searched for I found this amazing bourbon, whiskey and gin. As we frolicked through the in' s and out's of there distilling methods I soon came to realize I have stumbled upon the ""holy grail"" and felt as if there were angel babies swimming in my mouth. Of course I felt this way only after tasting the pure taste of bourbon. But not just any bourbon. Bourbon made from angel babies. Babies that people who have seen Willy Wonkas movies would call Oompa Loompas. But all that aside I would say their whiskey is above average......one of a kind. In short, after reading this you can see your product obviously has an effect on me both mentally, physically, and later... Hopefully............ sexually. ",0,0,0,0,1

 What a bummer this store was. The husband and I were willing and ready to drop some serious money on shoes and accessories for our family when we headed to Sole Sports. We had a coupon that we received at a run a few weeks back and thought we should take advantage of it. We researched the website and we were impressed with the information that we read. Upon entering the store we could tell that 3 of the individuals were employees. One woman and two men. To be fair the woman and one man were helping other customers, but one man was on a computer in the back. Typically in this small of a store they really should at least say hello when a customer enters however we received not even a nod in our direction to acknowledge our presence. I looked at my phone to check the time at this point. Five minutes later we still had not been acknowledged and I told my husband ""You know I am about to drop a few hundred bucks on shoes here, it would be nice if somebody would say 'be with you in a minute' or something to that effect."" We decided that it wasn't worth it at that point and took our business elsewhere. ***Edited from a 2 to a 3 star on 05/01/2013 based solely on the owner's comment below.*** The owner reached out to me here and in a private message this morning asking us to come back so they could change our minds. I appreciate his sincere messages back to me and feel that they are worth another chance based on the other great reviews here. Hopefully our experience was isolated and simply a misunderstanding.

 Note that this review is solely for the pancakes (specifically the banana nut ones). If you go there, get something else. After all, other reviewers seem to like this place okay. Each pancake was like a thick slab of cardboard. They were way too dry. You could barely choke them down, and when I drenched them in syrup to try and moisten them up (to the point where the syrup was nearly overpowering), it was still too dry. Once again, I don't know about the other food, but go somewhere else for pancakes. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Went to Montreal for the day and wanted to seek out the two best things Quebec has to offer (other than beer and hockey) smoked meat sandwiches and poutine. Narrowed down my selections to Schwartz's for a sangy and La Banquise for poutine. After downing the most delectible smoked meat sandwich ever at schwartzs, we headed over the La Banquise to pile some gravy and cheese curds on top of it! Although poutine isn't very complex, I wasn't all that impressed with La Banquise. They have a huge menu, with all kinds of adaptations on traditional poutine, we stuck to the traditional. It was average, but I was a little disappointed after all the reviews I had read. Although I think anything would have been sub par after Schwartz's.

 We thought we would get a decent meal in us before we headed back to Los Angeles. Got seated at about 930 AM. We ordered our drinks a muffin and waited. Keep- in mind we were one of four tables in the place. About twenty minutes later more parties start rolling in. We get our muffin, blueberry, it was ok. Next thing I know. Three tables which had been seated about twenty minutes after we had been seated were served their meals. We wait patiently. No word from our server. She didn't stop by to ask how things were or that the kitchen was a bit swamped. At 1030 I got up to ask about our food. Our server ignored my presence for a couple minutes (she was reorganizing the muffins in their little glass display). I just wanted to pay for the drinks, muffin and leave. She tells me that there was a big party (there wasn't one that was there before us and when they did show up it was twenty minutes after we were seated) no apology didn't even attempt to make it up. I am usually a calm person. I was pretty hot. So I then point out the tables that were served before us. Their food came out within ten minutes. Before I could pout out the third table she waves her hand at me saying ""it's ok the drinks are on me"" not one attempt to correct the problem. Just says drinks are on the house. We leave hungry n I was pissed. Thank you lady at Wy-Knot cafe I hope you have a good one ;) Oh the Americano was ok. I got a coke yeah I know. It was in a bottle that was good.

 Where do I begin? ...Vdara is an oasis in a desert of loud, smokey, drunken hotels. Its location is doesn't sacrifice the feeling part of the ""strip"", yet provides a feeling of getting away. It offers a touch of class, value, and flair. We stayed in the Vdara suite, which was a $50 upgrade from our $90/night Hotwire Deluxe suite reservation. The 51st floor room offered an expansive North side view of Las Vegas, in addition to a clear view of the Bellagios famous fountain show. Our room came equipped with 2 flat screen TV's, a separate living room with a pull out couch, washer/dryer combo, a full kitchen, tub/shower combo, Egyptian cotton robes, and complimentary slippers. In short, more than enough amenities to make the stay extremely comfortable. The pool: I was iffy about this before, because I once stayed in at Mandalay Bay and thought, how could a pull ever rival that. Although Vdara does not offer a wave pool, and lazy river like Mandalay, what it offers is equally as appealing. There are 3 seperate pools, one being a sauna spa pool, and the other 2 waiting pools. Its located on the 3 floor and offers a slight view of the entrance way among other things. Overall the ratio of people to pool made the experience overall more relaxing ......there was no struggle to fight for space. Overall if you are looking for service, flair, tranquility, accessibility, and still a connoisseur of all things Vegas, then this is the place for you! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I am quite a fan. I have been going for maybe 13 years with my autistic son. We have seen Dr. Carr and Dr. Bacon - both are wonderful. I also have brought my daughters. Most recently we had an emergency visit because my 7 year old daughter got a scratch on her eye and was in lots of pain. I was told to bring her right over and Dr. Bacon got her in immediately. They had no paperwork on her because it had been 6 years since she had an eye exam! (Only ever did the check at one year old.) There was no charge for the visit even though I was told on the phone that just the emergency consult would be $75! How is that for amazing care?! I highly recommend this office. ",0,0,0,0,1

It was ""Burger Day"" (my birthday, but I wanted to make it all about the burgers see?). It was the middle of the Festivals. No where was taking bookings, especially for a party of 20. But after giving these guys a quick bell, they were happy to accommodate. First win Innis & Gunn itself is a local, and local's favourite, beer. Not a beer drinker myself, when I heard they were opening their own bar I did think it would be a little beer-heavy. Not at all. Yep, they've got all their own beers bottled but they've also got a huge range of whiskies, a few cocktails and plenty other spirits for your imbibing needs. I thought they might only have your standard beef, cheese, chicken and veggie burger options. Oh no. There's the Independence, the Irish (with Jamieson whisky bourbon sauce) and a few others my poor memory can't remember. 18 of us feasted, and there 18 very clean plates by the end of it. Not that I had low expectations, I just didn't expect the range and quality to be *that* good. So I was a very, very happy birthday bunny that day. Thanks I&G for a great meal, great birthday and maybe think about sticking around for longer than the summer, what do you say? ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have few things to add from what everyone has already said. It's awesome. Go. Now. I'll wait. An awesome shop (with a new A/C unit just installed today!), with everything you could possibly ever need and a lot of things that you never knew you wanted. I could have spent all day and most of my paycheck in here. Books, kitchen items, bar items, bathroom items, purses, totes, playing cards, artwork by local artists of our beautiful town and it's places, pet items (mostly dog stuff, but some cat items as well for us spinster broads who love the kittehs) and more cards than Hallmark. I was just in awe. There is parking along the front of the building and some behind. While I was in there I kept hearing giggles from the card section, so I stopped and got a few to share with my twisted gaggle of friends. Everything I spotted, with rare exception, was reasonably priced. I ended up with some hi-larious coasters, some greeting cards and a tote bag (I have an odd compulsion to buy tote bags wherever I go - it's weird). Go, have fun, buy some stuff... you won't be sorry. ",0,0,0,0,1

 ***UPDATE*** After posting the following review, I was contacted via Yelp by a person calling herself ""Kate G."". Kate stated, ""I would like to get your phone number so that our corporate side can look into this and discuss."" I asked Kate G. who she was & she stated she was Landry's Social Media Coordinator. Why didn't you tell me that in your first e-mail? Ummm, I don't hand out my phone number to random internet contacts! Why on earth would I give my phone number to Kate? Does she think I want to be bothered my her or Corporate? I can't be bought off with a gift certificate from Landry's. I will never eat there again. I filed a complaint with the Southern Nevada Health District!!! So, listen up Kate G., you can NOT have any of my personal information. May I suggest you introduce yourself before asking for someone's phone number. BTW, I still have nightmares over what happened to me! I got so ill after eating here I thought I would die. Never again! I had a steak, loaded potato, green beans & one glass of wine. I'll have PTSD whenever I think of that night. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This place was great. I've never had Vancouver-style sushi before, but have a friend from BC who suggested this place. After we'd been, I was actually very surprised at the ratings on yelp, largely because I had a great experience and got just what I expected. I mean, this is a $20ish all-you-can-eat experience, so I certainly wasn't expecting them to roll out the red carpet. In fact, I was impressed by what they had to offer. The sushi was fresh, and tasty. They set this whole thing up so that you don't order a ton and waste it, and so that they can still make money. So some of the sushis are a little small, but that's ok because you can order more. They also have what amounts to an upgraded menu which you can order from for about $4 more, if I'm remembering correctly, but neither of us felt the need to do that. Instead, we spent our time consistently ordering some favorites (mmm white tuna!) and then trying some things that we were a little puzzled by. I'm not sure that all of these were quite what we were interested in, but isn't trying everything sort of the point of a place like this? My biggest complaint (other than the puzzling decor, which seemed to have a theme of sticks and visually-assaulting paint colors) would be that the vegetable tempura was absurdly small. You order the broccoli tempura and you're going to get two bite-sized pieces. I mean... they have a fee for things you don't finish, so I felt that maybe they could have stepped it up a bit and gone for a more generous 5 broccolis. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was quite happy when Batch opened. It's down the street from my house, so nearly every day I've walked past it and stared at the kitchen window where people are baking. It always looked so delicious! However, I'm not sure if I haven't tried the right items yet, or if I'm just picky about bread, because both the baguette and the croissant were just mediocre. It's definitely good quality compared to the average bread I get at Madison restaurants, but it doesn't come close to the baked goods at Sophia's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sophias-bakery-and-cafe-madison) or loaves of bread from Madison Sourdough (http://www.yelp.com/biz/madison-sourdough-company-inc-madison). Specifically, the bread didn't really taste like anything. I would think it hadn't been given enough time to rest and develop flavor through longer fermentation, or like they hadn't started with a poolish (starter). Texturally, the baguette was too fluffy and uniform inside, with no little air pockets or visible strands of gluten structure. The flavor of the croissant was good, but the texture seemed too dense and packed together, like the butter hadn't broken through the layers the way it is supposed to. I would also suggest a little less marzipan inside the almond croissant - it was a bit too sweet. I enjoyed their fougasse, which is a little bit like a focaccia. Given the weaknesses with their dough, this makes sense, since a fougasse has a fair amount of oil and herbs that can cover up a flavorless dough. Maybe I was there on an off day, or maybe I haven't tried the right items. I'll certainly be back another time or two, but I'm keeping my expectations lower next time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We always wanted to try this place out so we figured why not today. The ambiance is very nice and was actually pretty surprised when I walked in. We were greeted by a number of folks and was presented with warm bread. For a steakhouse they're fairly cheap but you do get what you pay for. I ordered the aged prime ribeye (med-rare) and she got the chicken. We also had a side of mac and cheese and the lump crab cake. The Mac and cheese and the lump crab cake were extremely good. Too bad it ended there. My ribeye was cooked a little on the rarer side and was rested for too long. By the time it arrived it was on the cool-warm side. The chicken dish she ordered tasted pretty bad. It was cooked fine and might be a personal preference but it did not taste good at all. We didn't really want to spend any more money here and their desserts weren't anything special. For the amount of money we paid, I would have preferred something much better as in Lawry's or a steakhouse on the strip. I probably would have been happier eating a bowl of cereal at home. 3/10 Mac n cheese is pretty good ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is my first yelp review and my first trip to Vegas :) Prior to starting my vacation, I read reviews and menus of many of the steakhouses on the Strip. My first choice was Gordon Ramsays, but it was booked up for the next five days. Since I was staying at Vdara, I wanted something close as my friends and I were going downtown after dinner. We arrived at 7:30 on Thursday night - yes, two days ago :D we were seated immediately and decided on food! The atmosphere was pretty cool, I'm 32 and quiet steakhouses and piano music aren't my thing! My other two friends are around my age also. We read that there are dancers, but not on the night I want. Maybe it's a Friday night only thing? Anyhow, our server, Jamie, was great. I ended up ordering the 12oz center cut - cooked medium with roasted carrots and pur \ u00e9e potatoes. Also, they have Jordan Cabernet on the wine list and I was super excited to score a glass of it with my dinner. Our server promptly served the Cab when the steak came out as I requested and the steak was awesome! After finishing dinner, the dessert menu was brought out and the popcorn infused milkshake immediately caught my eye, from there, it was game on! The vanilla milkshake is excellent and adding the caramel popcorn is the icing on the proverbial cake. I will be back in Vegas in July and She' will again be on my short list for dinner. ",0,0,0,0,1

 My fiance and I needed a quick place to stop for lunch on our way between Sedona and Los Angeles. We were driving through Phoenix, and we settled on D'lish because it was a well-reviewed drive-thru with plenty of options. It was a good choice, quick, affordable, and tasty. There was a short line for the drive-thru, but we were helped relatively quickly. I was expecting a McDonald's-style drive-thru speaker system, but an employee came out and took our order while we waited in our cars. The same employee then took our money at the pay window and maybe even gave us our food at the food window? Is that too Looney Tunes? Maybe there was another employee or just the one window. Either way, he was a nice guy. I ordered the combo lunch with a sandwich, a side, and a small drink. I chose the turkey club, which was a pretty decent sandwich with smoked turkey, bacon, cheese, avocado, tomato, and lite honey mustard spread, served on toasted whole wheat. It was a decently sized sandwich, not heavy but filling. It was maybe a little dry despite having good turkey - less bread, maybe, or more mayonnaise would have done the trick. I picked a soup for my side, a red pepper bisque that came with bagel chips. This was excellent. The soup was soothing and thick with tomato and red pepper, and the crispy bagel chips were perfect for dipping. I'd definitely recommend a soup if you're coming through D'lish. For my drink, I subbed in the Breakfast Buzz for a little bit extra. I wasn't quite sold when I read the description on the menu, but as I often do, I let the voice of Yelp dictate my order. This drink was a shake made with vitamins, protein, espresso, nonfat milk, peanut butter, banana, and chocolate, blended with ice. Pro tip, guys - don't lead with vitamins and proteins. It makes your drink sound less delicious. I'm glad I got the Breakfast Buzz against my fat-craving inner skeptic - it was fantastic, creamy and refreshing with plenty of banana, peanut butter, and chocolate to silence the healthier components. We ate our lunch in the car and drove off in less than fifteen minutes. It was a nice, efficient stop, and the food was well worth stopping for. I'd recommend to D'lish to Phoenicians and weary travelers alike. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Came here with a large group excited for a good meal. Very nice decor and atmosphere inside. And that's about the only thing going for it. The only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because of the free cheese cake offered as our wedding gift. The prices are quite extreme for the portions provided. The salmon was nearly $40 and was barely enough to fill you up with its tiny scoop of plain rice and 4"" long salmon steak. Service was very poor. My wife asked for a drink refill and it was never delivered and the staff was rude and stuck-up. Couldn't even tip low due to a unavoidable 20% tip already included. Never again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 2.5 Stars I share the sentiment with my fellow Yelpers on The Golden Spoon on its decline of quality. I first found The Golden Spoon in Carlsbad, CA about 8 years ago. They then infiltrated the valley with many many stores which made me happy with our favorite place for Froyo at that time. After having a pretty good presence in the valley stores started to close for good. My six mile trek became traveling across town to get this awesome Froyo. The Golden Spoon to me is like one of those family members you look past their flaws because you're so fawn of them. Well my eyes are now open to the fact that their frozen yogurt no longer has the same great taste I remembered and this store is always dirty. As much as it pains me, I am not sure I will drive 26 miles one way to come here any longer. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Went there following yelp reviews for lunch. Seeing that they had 4 stars my expection was high, I must say. But I was a little taken back when no one was there. Should have been a sign but I trusted my fellow yelpers. Servers were nice. But food was very low quality. Because the menu was all over the place I went for what I know. Beef and broccoli (can't go wrong there) boy was I wrong!!! Beef was low grade skirt steak. Just bad!! Had the hot and sour soup. And must admit that was good. But entrees where very disappointing. Overall I'm giving them a 1 star. I would definitely not recommend this place. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I am convinced that anyone who gives Ha Long Bay more than three stars hasn't eaten really exceptional Vietnamese & Thai (which are both easier to find exceptionally done in bigger, more diverse cities). I like Ha Long Bay and eat there frequently, largely due to proximity and lack of other options, but it is not four-star (or five!) worthy. Upsides: -When dishes are good here, they are very good. The best dish I've had so far is the ""LS7 Nem Khao Tod: Crispy rice with minced sour sausage, chicken, onion, cilantro, mint, lime juice, topped with peanuts, served with lettuce for wrapping,"" which I eat rarely because I have to take an ethical meat time-out. -The only other place to get decent Pho is on the west side, by the mall. When I am chilled to the bone and want Pho, this is the place to go for it. I am sort of a chicken addict, but I still think that the chicken is the best Pho at Ha Long Bay, even though it isn't traditional. -The staff is generally friendly, and they have to be, because it's a zoo in this restaurant most of the time. Downsides: -When dishes are bad, they are very, very, bad. Bland & tasteless, as many of the reviewers have pointed out. The drunken noodles are not good, for example, and neither is the Pad Thai, and these are two dishes that should be easy to make flavorful. -Sometimes, Ha Long Bay gets overwhelmed by the volume and food takes a long time. I've seen several people melt down when waiting for take out. -Ha Long Bay falls into the same sphere as many restaurants in Madison that think that to make food hot, it is acceptable to toss a full bottle of crushed red pepper into a dish 2 minutes before serving it. This is also the only way to get food spicy at Ha Long Bay (but, again, getting hot food in Madison is impossible, unless you go to Vientiane Palace). -The music is sometimes so bad that it's hard to concentrate on eating. Think oriental elevator folk music with strings. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have to say this place is muey beuno!, even though it is in Mesa. I try not to go to Mesa, if I don't have too. (yes I am a snob, by at least I recognize that fact) Mesa to me is TOO suburban, in the middle of the Metroplex that is Phoenix. BUT (insert a big But here) You need to make your way to Mesa to hit this joint up. I can't say if it's authentic Mexican because I don't know what that means anymore, but Its delicious!, Like I said at dinner when asked ""how's your food?"" My response ""Scrum-dittily-umptious!"" (2 points to the person can name that movie this line is from) I ordered the grilled halibut, with Mango Chutney and sauted Spinach, of course it came with Spanish rice. It was perfect! I love fish done differently, and Halibut is great grilled. The smoky flavor of the fish, basted in a honey and spice marinade, with the fruit, put the combo in combination. After spending the day watching Planet Terror, I couldn't eat anything that resemble meat, or flesh, or BBQ. (zombies movies and food put the bad in bad combination) I did enjoy the green salsa with chips, the red wasn't so great however. They have a great atmosphere and really nice outdoor seating. It is very distinct and unique, and the service is excellent. It is a perfect place for kids, family, or just plain fun. I would say out of all the Mexican joints I have been too, this is the best in my opinion. Extra points because they serve crushed iced, not cubed. I love that with water or diet coke. No threat of Mexi-cali blues here..Just enjoy the food but watch out for the balloon bearing, comedic presence of ""Dirty Sanchez"" It is this guy dressed up like a Mexican in a Sombrero, if you make eye contact he will start entertaining your table. The Mariachi Band is nice, I just wish they would stick to Mexican and Spanish songs, their cover of ""It's a Small World After All"", is rather sad. They take requests, and unfortunately people, want to hear English songs. I prefer the music in their dialect, it adds to the charm. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We are big fans of Paradise Bakery..we eat there at least 2-3 times a week (it's down the street from us..can you blame us)?! Much like Paradise Bakery, there is a soup and salad/sandwich combo offering. You get a whole sandwich, AND a lovely chocolate dipped strawberry (disappointing for my husband-he really loves the cookie thing at Paradise Bakery). I had a pulled pork sandwich (great) and the Yucatan Chicken soup (sooo good) you can even sample the soup! How fun is that?! My only complaint, is that it feels a tad claustrophobic at this location. The tables are all jumbled together and there is this ""recharge your device"" thing in the center that is really very wasted space. If the tables were spaced out more, I would definitely give this 4 stars. Someone else mentioned the awkward feel of the ordering area. I'm going to agree on that, though I felt that way with Paradise bakery. It can feel a little chaotic when it's crowded and you're not quite sure what to do. ",0,0,1,0,0

 All hype? Honestly the only reason I wanted to come here was cuz I saw it on Man vs Food. If you're a fan of huge portions you might like his place, but I prefer smaller portions with better flavor. Wow, I sound like a food snob, but I don't mean it that way. I just felt the Fried Chicken Benedict had too much going on. And the fried chicken didn't seem to complement the benedict. It just added a heavier element to the already heavy ingredients. We also got a salad and soup which I didn't mind cuz the flavors were there, just in a bigger bowl. I didn't feel that way about the benedict. I don't regret trying this place, but I don't think I'd come back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Emergency Arts is a stunning array of indie galleries, shops, pop-ups, tech and coffee. Every day there seems to be something new about the place. Once you exit The Beat, you'll encounter vibrant artwork and artists in their element. I also like that there are little resting areas (tables/couches) that one can sit back and relax or even work at. They often host events here, such as the weekly ""Jelly""s, which are tech meetups. This is definitely a nice spot when you want to discover the other side of Vegas. ",0,0,0,1,0

 very convenient and the place is perfect for a quick bite. nice little place with relaxing atmosphere. The place is well set up and organizec and the staff is quite friendly and helpful. I was really impressed when the cashier came over and gave us more change as she accidently charged us for an extra pizza and she noticed the error herself. So we went at an off hour and the place was empty. We got the lunch special for three of us which included a nice salad, a drink and a personal pizza. But oh my we shared the salad and the pizza was enough for three of us with some leftover! Great deal! the pizza was nice thin crust with small slices and well balanced with cheese and sauce. We got extra cheese as you get one topping with the lunch special but i like how they tell you the crust is not made for more than 3 toppings. The salad was nice as not soaked as well. The food was definitely a hit. The only reason 4 stars is a am a NYer and I still haven't found as good of a pizza out here......do we blame the water? ",0,0,0,1,0

 I brought my date to this restaurant because of her previous experience with their green curry. We ordered the green curry and the chicken basil with a sticky on the side. Although the green curry and chicken basil was delicious, the sticky was rock solid. As far I can remember, sticky rice were not suppose to be like rocks. Furthermore, we ordered the mango sticky rice dessert. That too was a big disappointment. It was sad when my date stated that she can make better product that Yupha. Lastly, the service was sub-par when it gets busy. We tried numerous times flagging a helper for addition rice. I think the service is good when it isn't busy.

 What a depressing shithole... Every employee should be on suicide watch. I go to a post office once a year and it gets so much worse each time. When are they going out of business again?? I went in, used a machine, dropped my box and left. EVERYONE in line looked miserable. The one employee I spoke with was friendly, the others looked like they were about to cry at any minute. The location is convenient, but it's the only post office in the area. The parking is well laid out and the entrances and exits will get you to either road in either direction safely. On the inside, it is FILTHY and sad. The floor must not have been swept since it opened. The counter tops were unkempt and disorganized.

 Now, I love Indian food and basically will order it every where I travel to because I always get a craving for it. I had been thinking about Taj Palace for some time now and finally got the family to try it out..... a. Ambiance - strip mall setting, plenty of seating arrangements and for various size. Perhaps you can fit up to about 85 people, so it was decent size. Good lighting, nice bar, buffet area, tables and booths. I say 4 star. b. Service - It was not busy, so we got pretty darn good service from everyone there. Although it seemed to take like forever for the food to come out and the natives were getting a bit restless. 4 star c. Food -3 star a. Chicken Tikka Marsala - OK, so this is really an English invented Indian dish and not popular in India. I get it. Just like Chop Suey and Fortune cookies in Chinese cooking, these were things invented not in the original country. I get it. But man was this dish uninspired!!!!!!! The chicken was cut in huge cubes. The best way to slice is to take the breasts and cut at angles to get thin against the grain meat that when cooked, produce an aromatic and tender chicken. Eating these chunks, was like eating chunks. We asked for 2 out of 10 spice due to the kids and this thing was more spicy than the 5/10 spice I ordered for the Lamb. 2 Star b. Lamb Bhuna - i was a looking for the Lamb Roghan Josh. The spice was mild, perhaps they messed this up with the miles Tikka I ordered? The lamb was a bit tough, however the gravy sauce was awesome and quite tasty. I give this a 3 star. Great taste, terrible texture. c. Garlic Naan - Kids loved it, we had to order another servicing. 4 star d. Tandoori Chicken - Hmmm good color, bit dry, on a bed of peppers, very tasty, if not overly cooked. 2 star. To me, a family of four and it cost about 85.00 including tip. Way too expensive and not enough to warrant a return visit. 1 Star. ",0,0,1,0,0

 So maybe its because I live in Texas, but this place just doesn't work for me. The mixed drinks are pathetically weak - if you're going to make a margarita, do it right. And the queso with chorizo is almost unbearably salty. Chorizo is already salty people, don't add extra! And the spinning happy hour wheel is a good idea, but the prices are too high. Happy hour should be cheaper than the norm, not exactly the same ($3 XX are nothing new, maybe in Vegas thats a bargain) The bathroom has attendants?! Why? In this place? They have a whole damn pharmacy laid out on the counter. Anyway, I was not impressed, and it was crazy expensive for what you got - weak drinks and a small salty queso ($9 a piece for a margarita, $12 for queso), but the atmosphere was decent, so I'll let it slide with 2 stars ",0,1,0,0,0

 We were excited to hear of a new tapas restaurant in the neighborhood. We stopped in excited to try this place before heading to a show, only to walk in and discover it felt like nothing more than a PT's kind of vibe. We sat down at the bar to order a drink and dine, the bartender had a bit of an attitude letting us know she was very busy (but the place didn't seem that bad!), we finally ordered one drink, but the bartender took so long to come back that we were so turned off by the place, we never even ordered food....

 i am SO disappointed in Reflections, it's in fact very sad. when i first moved into my beautiful apartment (January of 2013), with granite counter-tops and an enormous kitchen i was in heavenly bliss. they were in the process of just finishing up renovations, with a gorgeous pool house, sauna, gym, Jacuzzis...the works, and for the first year and a half i LOVED it here. granted there were some issues of the gates never being fixed, and continuously standing ajar for the whole city to come and go as they please, yet i still felt safe, and the management and workers here were great, always friendly, on the ball, and getting things done when they were needed to be done. then the managerial changes occurred. Jada a good manager, was replaced by Ryan a GREAT manager, some amazing staff members were relocated to other complexes, and other new, albeit competent were brought in, no problem. then they started firing all the great new lease agents, keeping the incompetent ones, and hiring people who barely lasted a month. finally Ryan left, followed by Stephanie and Trinity brought in a slew of rude, incompetent imbeciles who can barely sign their own name without using spell check, and all this for a tremendous hefty height in rent. my lease was up back in August, and personally as much as i love living here, i was worried about being able to afford the rent increase, but i stuck it out and asked them to renew my lease, the lease renewal was unfortunately being done during their new incompetent hires. back in June, when i first requested a lease renewal, i didn't give it a second thought. yet 3 weeks later in the beginning of July, when i have still not received one, i was getting a little anxious, as the buildings policy is, if you do not sign a renewal lease, then you pay a month to month with a penalty of an additional $100.00 per month, which would be added to the rent increase, making the rent of a one bedroom apartment at close to $1000.00 (trust me, far from worth it). after talking to one of the new hires, Courtney, i asked for a lease renewal, she gave me a fake smile, tried to hide her rudeness, didn't bother writing my info down, and said she'll have one ready by the end of the week. needless to say, and to make a long story short due to space, it took them up to up to TWO DAYS before my lease was up, and they STILL didn't have a lease ready for me, it was only with my raising my voice, and raising holy hell that they said they would get right on it. on August the first i STILL didn't hear anything form them, so i called to find out was going on they said, they were waiting for my home insurance info, so i asked if they called the insurance company they said they didn't, so i asked how were they planning to get the insurance info, they said i was supposed to get it to them, i asked if they contacted me for the info, again they said no. so i questioned how were they planning to get info if they never bothered to ask anyone for it? Courtney just gave me a vacant look like she didn't understand what i was even talking about, and said ""i don't know"". that is how their leasing agents ""work"", now lets talk about the grounds. because of the bug infestation here, the pools, and the jacuzzis, when the jets and heat aren't broken, are uninhabitable because i have an issue of doing the breaststroke, with a cockroach doing the backstroke along side of me trying to keep up. the pools and jacuzzis (again when they are working, which in fact is quite rare) are usually filthy with dirt, grime, leaves and bugs...lots and LOTS of bugs. even the main house has an ant infestation in the kitchenette area. they claim they spray weekly, but when you see a parade of ants, all over the coffee machine, you tend to wonder if they are spraying with pesticide or water? the little refrigerator that is to house water for the residents is void of water, but now filled with employee left over lunches, going back who knows how long. the dog fecal matter is lying petrified outside my building, so they can claim that they clean it up every morning all they want, but i don't know of a single dog who has WHITE poo. and don't even get me started on the bird dropping on the stairway, because the area is such a delicatessen for them because of the bugs. the AC in the gym has been broken for ages, and when i told them about it, they said they had someone take a look at it but it was fine (86 degrees is NOT fine). there are fights and arguments in the parking areas, people blast their music from their cars at all hours of the night, there was even a shooting here. this place has gone to holy hell, and i can't wait for my lease to expire, because this time, no matter how much i love my kitchen, the filth and low class of tenants and management that they brought in are far from worth it, especially for the price they charge.

 Axum happened to be my first real experience with Ethiopian food (previously I had it while going to school at an ethnic potluck dinner). I went here with a group of 8 - 10 people, one of which loved the place and was actually the one to suggest we go. When I walked it I immediately noticed that there was group of I am guessing Ethiopians sitting around the bar and no one else. The place did not look very prepared for serving restaurant patrons. So the menus come out and I guess since he had suggested the restaurant he decided to order for everyone, since he was familiar with the cuisine. I'm a little miffed at this point, but don't care enough to make a big deal about it. At least they ordered some vegetarian food. So when the food comes out, they have these huge platters with injera, the traditional Ethiopian bread, on the bottom and the food on top. I enjoyed the experience of eating with my hands and sharing, but the food was not that great and the atmosphere totally sucked. When we had finished our meal, the waitress mentioned that the restaurant was under new management and handed us some business cards. I'm guessing the change of management could account for the discrepancy between Keith A's review and mine. Either that or I'm just a picky asshole. It's probably the later. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The ribeye was cooked to perfection and was mouth watering delicious. I would place this steak at the top of the food pyramid. We sat at the bar due to crowding, and enjoyed every moment of our time here. Great food, great service, great folks. If I had ten thumbs, I would give it a ""ten thumbs up""! Highly recommend the Sante Fe Spring Rolls as an appetizer. They were simply, ""Oh, my!"". Can't say enough so I'll shut up, a terrific meal and a good time abounded! ",0,0,0,0,1

 OMG I am so glad we found this joint! Their food is incredible, portion sizes are huge and the price well can't complain because of the quality and quantity. There is soo much stuff to choose from on their menu that you have no idea where to begin. The Chicken parm dish is awesome and huge! The Greek salad has an incredible dressing! The roast beef is great but reminded me of Arby's with the 3 way sauce, which isn't what I was expecting but still good. The Steak bomb, a EC version of a Philly cheesesteak, was actually quite light but really tasty. So far I have been impressed with everything we have tried and honestly I can't wait to go back and try something else. The staff is friendly and happy to assist you. I really hope this place continues to make a name for itself. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I'll keep this review short and sweet since there are so many and it's such a popular restaurant people will keep coming regardless: Made reservations about a month in advanced, no problem being seated in a timely manner. D \ u00e9cor is really neat but the ambiance was a little loud and casual for my taste, being on a date and all. Timely and attentive service, if not a little *too* attentive at times... Bread sampler was definitely special, going through about 2 1/2 of them! Make sure to at least try them all, but don't get too full or you'll regret it as we did. I got the bone-in ribeye, which while delicious, still left a little to be desired...Oh and it was overcooked the first time which I had to send back. Even still I might prefer Ruths Chris more. My girlfriend got the fillet, which was out of this world, and perhaps one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten -- a must have! For sides we got the potato puree, which is exactly that: fairly runny and airy and really fantastic, just don't expect your traditional mashed potatoes. We also got the cheese/truffle mac and cheese. It was extremely rich and a little underwhelming. I'd much rather have passed on this and saved room for dessert. Overall, it is definitely worth returning to, just not in the near future with all the other seemingly-amazing restaurants and buffets on the strip. Without a doubt on the pricier side, but what else is there to expect? ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've gotten my haircut here over the years when I've lived in that Happy Valley area. I've had it cut by Jennifer mostly and Philip a couple years back. I've never had a problem with this Supercuts. And, I'm extremely picky about my hair and paranoid of getting bad haircuts. Prior to coming here, believe it or not, I went to Aveda salons so I was worried about them slaughtering my hair. But, Jennifer and Philip always have done a great job and have been super friendly. I'm not trying to discredit some of these reviews because we've all had our own experiences, but I find it really hard to believe that Philip was rude to anyone! He's always super friendly to me and to everyone that I've seen him come into contact with in there. I think you might need to give him another try if you had a bad experience because he's got a witty sense of humor from what I remember and I can't imagine he would intentionally be rude to anyone!

 We have been wanting to check out Delmonico for a while now, and with it being Restaurant Week, it made sense to stop in! They only had a lunch special, but there was a lot of variety, and the food was great! Service was top notch as well, with our glasses never hitting halfway with a smile. Had to hit it with the 4 star, since some of the food was hit and some miss, but overall everything was good and a great value for RW. Started off with a surprise amuse! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#s2aCXocbqLcx3v6sl0_NZw Then the apps came out...The Heirloom Tomato Soup with Grilled Ricotta Cheese Sandwich was good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#ogoxihGvCtfmoq7L8TD1BA The soup itself was a little rich and thick, not very soupy consistency, but it worked well with the delicious Ricotta Cheese sandwich! But I tried a few spoonfuls without the sandwich, and it didn't stand on its own. Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#d9kt2ojPgUys4VgvTBOTOg Consisted of Burrata Cheese, Red Onion, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Balsamic Vinegar and Torn Local Basil. The company liked it, but since I am not a fan of tomatoes, I didn't bother trying it. On to the entrees! The Grilled Skirt Steak Sandwich was great! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#EWRi7UESqNjHjvYn0GlXLQ It was on Ciabatta with Roasted Mushrooms & Onions, Horseradish Mayonnaise, Spinach and Truffle French Fries! The sandwich itself was great! The steak was a perfect and tender medium rare, with the horseradish mayo adding the perfect blend of awesome! The truffle fries were great as well, but their style of fries are a bit overcooked for my tastes. Seems like they are twice fried here...and everyone's was like this, so I know it wasn't by accident. Still good though! Butternut Squash Ravioli : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#GQE0e9w2Ew-u0GzjA1SJjQ Consisted of Sage Brown Butter, Toasted Hazelnuts and Parmesan Cheese.

 This morning there was a line out the front door and there's a reason for that: everything is really good. There are a few tables but mainly the shop is set up for buying pastries, quiche, bread and sandwiches to take away. They have a building permit in the window, which is good because it means they are expanding, and I overheard someone behind the counter say that they are maybe opening on Sundays. The neighborhood, right on the line between central and upper Lawrenceville, is fast becoming the most vibrant area of Pittsburgh so it's easy to see why this place is thriving. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Newly renovated (last summer) store in the heart of downtown. Amazing staff - everyone is super helpful when it comes to helping you select the right gear, as well as offering tips on diet/nutrition and where to work out/do yoga etc. They offer free yoga classes on Sunday mornings, and a free run clinic each week, which are definite perks, and they also get involved in organizing community events in the summer. In terms of clothing, I generally love their stuff. BUT their quality has declined somewhat in the last 2 years, causing me to visit the store less. The prices, sadly, have not decreased despite some of the wishy/washy quality of certain items. That said, they do think of everything when creating their designs, like thumb holes, iPod pockets, inner pockets etc. Love that! I gave them a 4 because I think they're a little overpriced.

 Okay so it is a little hole in the wall and the greasy smell when I first walked in almost made me walk back out BUT I stayed and ordered and I must say that I'm glad that I did! I ordered the Tres Enchiladas plate which they changed up for me (normally you get one chicken, one beef and one cheese) to just three sour cream chicken. I also ordered my husband the two chimi (one beef and one chicken) combo plate. The dinners came with rice and beans and they included chips and salsa in the to go order without having to ask for it...nice touch! I get home and open my container still a little apprehensive after the smell of the restaurant. The first thing I notice is the size of the enchiladas. Wow! These were the most chicken stuffed offerings I've had from any Phoenix restaurant! Then I tasted them......oh, they know how to do an excellent enchilada! They were so flavorful and the sauce was light and creamy. Totally rocked it! The beans were also very good. Full of flavor, nice and sticky firm and not soupy like some places. Total win. Only thing that was disappointing was the rice. It was just there. Not much taste, bland, boring. yawn. Overall it was amazingly cheap and very, very good! The fact that it's just down the street?

 This is a piece of Montreal history, it is hard to explain this place to Vancouverites because there really has been nothing like it here. It is a bit of New York style deli, Chicago diner and French and Jewish picnic eats. It has stayed the same since it opened, Al Capone used to eat there when he was whisky smuggling, the old guys behind the counter have pictures of them when they where in their twenties on the wall, and there there is the sandwich. Just look at the pictures because it doesn't matter how I describe it. I will just say, Cherry Cott and sandwich and fries, or pickle, that's it, that's all. GO THERE when you are in Montreal.

 So my husband and I frequent Logan's and the past couple of times we've been eating there we've had bad experiences. I order my steak medium rare and have had to send it back twice to get it fixed because they over cooked it. I heard the server tell another table it was his 2nd day on the floor. He never once checked to see if we needed drink refills. That is a big tip indicator for me- you let my drink get empty and I have to ask for refills, not cool. So I sat there while my husband had his steak (which was cooked perfectly) and waited for mine to be done again. The manager did come over and acknowledged the situation. We got our bill and was disappointed with the overall experience. I'm resisting complaining about not getting a discount off our meal because I don't want to sound entitled, but we were disappointed that we weren't taken care of. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Garrett did a fantastic job cleaning and detailing my vehicle. I have a 2012 Subaru WRX Sti and wanted to make sure the paint was maintained properly with a good washing and sealant application. Ive had several cars in the past ranging from Supras, M3, GTO, etc, so i'm somewhat of a car nut. I've also had some pretty sub par experiences with ""other"" mobile detailers here in the East Valley. They would charge you and arm and a leg ($90-$100) and would only take 1 hour to complete the job using 1 person. Now im not an expert at math or anything, but unless they had more than 2 arms, a QUALITY detail sure as heck takes more than 1 hour, i know this from doing them myself. Quality work takes time, especially if you want it done right. Garrett was easy to work with, we set a time of 6am to start before it starting heating up outside. He showed up on time at 6, introduced himself, and started to work. Everything he has is self contained, so its very professional, he has everything he needs to complete the job. We discussed over the phone that it would take 2-3 hours to complete the detail because he had to use the polisher to apply the sealant. I would rather pay someone good money for a complete job, rather than a half assed job because they wanted to get done quickly. He had great attention to detail and even used some cutting compound to remove some surface scratches i had not previously noticed. Overall a great experience and great quality work for this price, especially for the time he takes, also dealing with the Arizona heat. Highly recommended! ",0,0,0,0,1

 We celebrated Christmas eve this year at Habitat. I had been wanting to dine here since they opened and this was our first opportunity. Just as we suspected, the restaurant was not at all busy. We both liked the ultra modern interior design, the dark woods and the bright punches of color. We were led to a table by one of the windows with a view of PNC Park in the distance and cold and lonely streets in the foreground. I luckily brought along my coat so I would not freeze!! From our table, we also had a view of the open kitchen. We were greeted by Raja, our warm and friendly server. BJ ordered his typical beer and my got my usual adult beverage. It was a drink with something extra, a huge lipstick imprint on the rim. So, we were not off to such a good start. The menu is limited, we shared a salad and the roasted butternut squash soup with Autumn spiced creme fraiche. It was brought out and served with a flourish. The bowl was placed in front of me and then the soup was poured from a small tureen. The only bad thing was, there was barely enough soup to cover the bottom of my bowl. But it was good. BJ ordered the locally raised grass-fed beef. I had warned him that other Yelpers advised that the beef was tough. They were right. Good thing BJ is strong enough to wield his not so sharp enough knife to actually be able to cut thru said beef. He also got a baked potato and a side of white cheddar crab mac. We both felt that the mac needed a bit more flavor. I ordered the shrimp pad thai. It was served in an interesting bowl and was an average size portion. I did enjoy the dish, however, I had a serious case of hives shortly after dining here. I feel it was connected to the pad thai. We also shared one of the desserts. It was interesting, but not enough that I remember much about it. Much like my experience at Habitat. It's nothing that is worth repeating. ",0,1,0,0,0

The pickled vegetables inside weren't the flavor I was used to and they overwhelmed the taste of the beef. The bread was pretty good. We also got a tamale which was pretty much a joke, it was microwaved and served directly in the plastic wrapper like it was bought in the frozen food section at the grocery store.

 We routinely try and book Homewood Suites because of the kitchen and the quality of the accommodations. I would have to say the Scottsdale Homewood Suites was the worst one we have every stayed in. The closet was tiny even though it looked large with the double mirrored door. In fact one door had a wall behind it. A lot of the dishes were dirty and someone had removed most of the shelves and all of the holding rails for the door shelves from the refrigerator. The wallpaper had splits and the shower in the bathroom wouldn't shift all to the shower. Basically it seemed like everything was old and if the breakfast wasn't good I would only have given 1 star.

 I feel Honey Salt is still trying to find its identity; both in the food and interior design department. The dining room is too open; reminded me of a high school cafeteria...too cramped and far too loud. I was seated along the far wall of tables with half booth, half chair. They seriously need to remove about 5 tables from this row and space things out a bit. Diners do not like to be sitting on top of one another; there was literally 6"" of space between the tables...""ummm excuse me, may I borrow your pepper?"" Not a fan...far too loud and cramped. Call your interior designer back out and get some aesthetic acoustic panels installed; that will go a long way (trust me I know, it's part of my business). Onto the food...well, everything was so-so. Turkey meatballs were undersized and not all that flavorful. The salmon (ordered medium well) was nearly raw in the middle. It was a nice flavor and portion size but the cooks need to know how to prepare to a proper temperature. The brown bag apple pie was pretty tasty...not really sure what the brown bag has to do with it but it's a unique presentation and tasted pretty good. The service: Started out slow...the table wasn't greeted for about 10 minutes; to his credit the place was packed. BUT, after that our server proved himself. I believe his name was Nick and he did a fantastic job after the initial slow start. - 1 star for poor design concept and noise - 1 star for barely above average food taste at quite a premium $ I will return in a month or two and hopefully some of the above noted issues will be resolved.

 Kinda hard to add anything new other than notch on the bedpost for Ichiza. I went in with high expectations and there were delightfully surpassed. I was with a group of 5, we ordered a ton of food, beer, and sake, just pointing to items on the wall at random, and the bill was totally reasonable (I think less than $40/person). Everything was fresh, delicious, and exquisitely prepared. The service was so-so, but who cares when your taste buds are dancing the Macarena on your tongue? The Hamachi collar was phenomenal, so was the red snapper carpaccio, and the honey toast. I can't remember everything we ordered, but nothing was disappointing.

 Besides the distaste that comes with the name of this place, first impressions of Meatmarket were pretty positive - Funny roadside animal collages and colourful chairs made the place feel pretty cozy. A surly waitress showed up straight away with tasty tortilla chips and an olive tapenade that almost made us forget about her bad attitude. The menu she'd plopped down in front of us had a number of original and appealing-sounding options like a duck-wing confit starter and a goat cheese and grilled zucchini-topped burger. We started with the flank steak poutine. The fries were little on the mushy side, and the steak much tougher than it could have been. The Asian garden salad with grilled tofu was the surprise success of this meal - Only slightly discerning that the vegetarian option at Meatmarket was better than the carnivorous one. The food overall was decent, but nothing to write home about. Meatmarket has some good stuff going for it, but doesn't quite get it all right. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Over priced dry burger. I ordered the standard with with pepper jack cheese jalapenos and an order of onion rings and a regular drink. The total came out to around 16 dollars. I thought to myself this burger better be worth it. We sat at one of the tables over looking the kitchen. I like the open kitchen feel you can see how your food is being cooked. To my surprise the onion rings came out pretty quick, hoping my burger would come out shortly. 15 min later my burger finally came out and by that time my onion rings were cold. I would have been ok if both came out at about the same time. The presentation of the burger was good and was pleased to see fresh jalapenos instead of your typical pickled peppers. Upon taking the first bite I found the burger to be very bland and very dry. I asked for a few cups of ranch to make up for the dryness of the burger. Ironically the only thing that I enjoyed was the ranch. Nice and thick and not watered down. Overall like I said over priced dry burger. Their beer selection looked promising so I may come back for a few beers and maybe their appetizers but definitely not for their burgers. I ""Love"" their Ranch but not their Burgers! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Let me start by saying this was a fun show with great music. It helps that I'm a Beatles fan. I had to refrain from singing along (since I knew all the songs). This is the second Cirque-like show I've seen. The first was Le Reve (we lucked into free tickets). I have since learned Le Reve wasn't a Cirque show, but it definitely is Cirque-like. So while I wouldn't classify myself as an aficionado, I do have a basis for comparison. As my rating indicates, the show was OK. It was enjoyable. It was fun. But it wasn't great. First, the athleticism I saw in Le Reve was mostly missing from this show. There was some acrobatics, but not nearly as much as I expected. And on several occasions the action was almost frenetic. It was difficult to focus on the performances because there was too much going on. Le Reve did not suffer this problem. Second, the story wasn't as clear as Le Reve. It seemed almost like a lot of random stunts and tricks without much purpose. Le Reve I could see the story they were telling. I know the story of Sgt Pepper, but it was still hard to follow the story in this show. So, even though I am a huge Beatles fan, I would recommend Le Reve before I would recommend this show. The story was easier to follow, the show was more visually interesting, and the acrobatics were more impressive. Only the music was better in this show, but if you already have the CDs you can listen to the music at home. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This place has the best donuts in the valley. I grew in Southern Cali and there are an abundance of locally owned shops there. It is a struggle to find a good quality donut shop around here.

The prices are great as is the selection. I like that they have a drive thru, which make it very convenient and fast. The Apple Fritter was crispy and delicious. The maple bar is soft and the maple icing is soooo good. You can tell these are fresh donuts as they are soft and fresh.

 this would 100% be a 5 star review if it weren't for the pushy obnoxious waiter :( We made it clear we just wanted a few rolls and apps...he continued to push us to have a full on meal and order super fancy expensive drinks... ALL WE WANTED WAS A FEW SUSHI ROLLS AND APPS....after about the 3rd time i said "" we really just want a few rolls"" he rolled his eyes in complete annoyance and snatched up the menus and walked away..EWWW.. The Sushi was delish as always...but the service really ruined it for us!!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I succumbed to peer pressure! Don't you hate it when you don't trust your own instincts? OK, so Yelp is a great resource and so are friends' recommendations. But when it comes right down to it, it's all a matter of opinion. When it comes to Carolina's Mexican Food, mine differs from most. I've mentioned in other reviews that I love the idea of a mom-n-pop place where local owners are doing their own thing, contributing to the local economy with jobs and paying their taxes. Plus, this place makes their own tortilla shells. so that's a nice touch. The food isn't especially memorable. The machaca or chicken tacos are appropriately sized overall, but contain mostly just iceburg. See for yourself with the posted pics. The chicken was flavorless, but the machaca was a bit easier to discern. Also, the size of the cheese quesadilla was fine, though proportionately had little cheese. In the interest of safety, I would NOT recommend coming here at night alone. If you must, be sure you're with a group of people and at least one or two of you have sobered after a night of drinking. This place is OK for taking care of the munchies. Just be sure you're careful to be safe in this less-than-stellar neighborhood. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The restaurant is located in the center of the mall and was easy to find. The signage was large and bright. The inside of the restaurant was clean and appropriately lit. There was music playing in the background and a football game was playing on the television above the bar. The temperature inside the restaurant was comfortable. My thoughts on the food: Shrimp Dumplings The shrimp dumplings were visually appealing and served warm on a round white dish. It was an appropriate serving for one or two guests. The dumplings tasted fresh and were served with a spicy soy sauce. Inside the dumplings there was a mix comprised of shrimp, basil, mint and red chili. The dumplings exceeded our expectations. Red Chili Shrimp We ordered the red chili shrimp based on our server's recommendation and we were not disappointed. This dish was visually appealing and served hot with sesame noodles, gai lan, spinach and shiitake mushrooms. It was a generous serving that provided enough food for two guests and exceeded our expectations. Turkey Lasagna This pasta dish contained spinach, ricotta cheese, organic tomatoes and ground turkey. It was served hot, flavorful and the ingredients tasted fresh. It was visually appealing and provided enough food for one guest. Lemon Tart The lemon tart was thick, with a dense texture that was softened by the serving of cream on top of it. This dessert was served cold and was large enough for two guests to share. It was artistically created and the taste exceeded our expectations. ",0,0,1,0,0

 So I've been back twice because that faux chicken was so amazing & I haven't found much to eat on the strip with my dietary restrictions. I got the Veggie wrap without the cheese or mayo & added faux chicken & avocado. I ordered it on a gluten free wrap & got bbq sauce to dip it in. The first time I ordered this it was AMAZING! The staff was hella friendly but I still think the price was insane. It was around $15 for a wrap with some greens. The second time I went it wasn't as amazing. The ""chicken"" was kinda dry & the service was back to the first time I went there. I wish this ""restaurant"" wasn't in a mall. I really dislike the atmosphere, the prices & how inconsistent it is. I will say it is the best I've found for healthy food on the strip. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Don't stay at the Hilton if you're in Vegas to party. It's off the strip, not walking distance to anything besides the Riviera or Circus Circus, and the hotel is just plain old. Come on now, Andrew Dice Clay was performing there this past weekend! And I'm willing to bet Paris Hilton never stays at her own namesake. Having said all this, I enjoyed staying there. It was fine for my purposes. It was so nice to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip. And even though it's off-season, Vegas is still busy enough make driving down Las Vegas Blvd a bitch and a half. There was a cowboy convention this past weekend, so it looks like it can still get pretty crowded, but it wasn't poppin like it was over at the Venetian, nor Bellagio, nor the Riveria for that matter. But that's just me, but then again Vegas always manages to make me feel a little dead and depressed inside. PS: I may be a little biased because our two-night (Sat & Sun) stay only cost us $105. And we got a $10 voucher for turning down maid service. booyah ",0,0,1,0,0

 I give this store 2 stars because only about 1/2 of the time do they even have what you want. The stock in the store is PATHETIC! They didn't have 5 items on my list of 25 things. Things like stick pretzels. They have 3 brands, and not one bag of stick pretzels was in the store. The Steak selection was a JOKE!. Not one steak more than 1/2 inch thick, and most we're less than that!. $9.56/lb for 3/8th in. NY Strips is not a good deal.

 Meh indeed. It's definitely a near-Strip, off-Strip casino. And hey, maybe the rooms are alright. But the casino itself definitely leaves something to be desired. This definitely not a place I would intentionally visit. But if you're for another reason... Well, even then, I would just go about your business and skip the casino. There are much better places to lose your money. It is nice, though, that it's never crowded. You can valet your car quickly and they bring your car back around even quicker. No 10 minute wait for your car here that's for sure. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I could not agree more with Alicia B's review. I went here with my husband Saturday night, it is in our nieghboorhood and we had heard decent things. We waited about 10 minutes for a table, not because it was full or busy. The hostess looked a right at us, no acknowledgement and then she went on to what must have been more important business. Finally, a passing waiter sat us. The service continued to be inattentive and slow. Our cocktails were tasty, I had a pomegranire margarita and my husband has something with a kooky name, I think it mentioned a Donkey. We had the Queso with crab which was pretty good, the crab could have been tastier and the whole thing needed some spice. The chips and salsa, OK. I had the carnitas, after recommendation by our waitress. Not bad, but certainly not good and not worth $17. My Husband has the seafood crepes, they were OK, but lacking flavor. The food was not bland, but flat, just meh. This place would be a 3 star, but for the price, it is coming down to a 2 star. The building and patio are really cool and set a good atmosphere, too bad the food and service don't follow suit. On a side note I did get to overhear a great conversation by two guys visiting from out of town, probably in thier mid to late 40s. I guess last time they came here the women were way hotter. This time there are hot women, but they are not as common. They seemed to like the place, one of them remarked the only thing better than his food was getting laid earlier that day. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My husband's parents picked this place so we met here for family dinner. It was a Sunday night and there wasn't a wait but when we went in there was a kid about 10ish working the register and then cleaning tables and picking up plates. I didn't think that was right and seemed odd. The buffet was kinda small and a lot of the pans were bare. It seemed like most of the food out wasn't even Chinese at all and of what was out, it was just kinda meh. If going off the food then I would only expect to it to cost somewhere in the $3-$5 range. Not to say the prices were bad, but they are comparable to most of the other buffets with either more of a selection or better food. At least the restaurant was filthy looking but there was lots of food/trash on the floor. If I had to go back, I would only end up getting the ice cream which is scooped out of ice cream containers and doesn't come out of a machine. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is a 2 part review that focuses mostly on service; as I have not dined there, but have on several occasions had business groups stop in for drinks. The decor is cool, and due to its proximity to the office, convenient. Beer list is decent. Not a wine connoisseur, but seems fine. Scotch collection is adequate. Service has been TERRIBLE on 2 occasions. 1. Had a large corporate group at the bar. Waitress serving tables at the bar was extremely annoyed and outright rude to us as it was implied that we were in her way repeatedly. Poor bar design is not the customers fault. The area is narrow and not suited to have easy access by servers. Also, the rest of the more accessible tables in the restaurant were empty, as it was barely 5:30. Manager came over to ask us to move later, and was also extremely rude and could use a lesson in customer service. A simple, ""Here group of 10 enjoying drinks at our bar, we want to make room for you over here"", would have done nicely. 2. A week later, another group of mine go to enjoy appetizers and drinks before dinner. We order the Paul Hobs 2007 Pinot Noir, they arrive and open a 2012. Upon realizing the error, we politely ask why the wrong wine was given, and also ask to just have the price of the 2012 vintage reflected on the bill. 1st response was, ""the bar manager said they are the same price"". When we ask to see the manager, we are promptly ignored on the issue for the rest of our visit. Suffice to say, inadequate service for a place which had great potential. Keep it up and you'll be closed before you can pay for the fancy decor and renovations. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've never eaten in at Crandall's, only ordered from them via grubhub.com, so that's what I'm reviewing. The food is fine, but they have no idea what they're doing at the restaurant. I've ordered from them three times and will never order from them again. The first time I ordered from Crandall's, I realized that I had entered the wrong address in grubhub so I called the restaurant to let them know. They had no idea what grubhub was and insisted on rudely telling me I had the wrong restaurant. The second time I ordered from them, I got a call - after an hour of waiting for the food - saying that they were out of what I had ordered. The third time, they packaged my order wrong and I received the wrong food. When I called to ask them to send me the correct order, they insisted it was the delivery guy's fault. I have no idea what goes on at that restaurant, but it is terribly run. I've never had such bad service. I've never written a Yelp review before, but I'm so annoyed with them that I felt it merited a review. ",0,1,0,0,0

 When you think romance....Paris is one of the first things that come to mind. When my fiance and I decided to hit Vegas for our honeymoon last year...The Paris Hotel was the way to go. We arrived and we were greated by a not so friendly staff. We had issues with our room (travel agents fault) and they would not budge to accomodate us. Finally they decided we could upgrade to a ""mini-suite"" for an additional $60 per night. We agreed and proceeded up to our room. The moment we walked into the room, we were unhappy. We overlooked........wait for it.....a roof top. I asked my husband to please go downstairs and tell them we no longer wanted to upgrade and we will just take the ""regular"" room. From the outside...its gorgeous....inside its just a crowded casino and not so friendly staff!!! I've been to Vegas multiple times and I won't ever stay here again! ",0,1,0,0,0

 The three stars are for the value and location of TI. Whenever my Vegas-loving friends and I are in need of a place to stay, TI always seems to have the best deal without having to stay at the very north or south end of the strip or completely off strip. TI's location is very convenient to first time or repeat Vegas visitors. Many of the other hotels, shops, clubs, restaurants, you-name-it are very accessible by walking. The rooms are okay. They are average sized--they don't feel cramped, but I wouldn't call them luxury by any means. Clean for the most part. The air of the hotel is old itself and sometimes the non-smoking rooms smell like smoking rooms. I wish there was better food options within the hotel. We are always looking for something quick and cheap to eat before going out or after coming home from a long night and TI has very little to offer in the food department other than the pizza joint.

 We popped in here on a GNO, 8 of us in total, to listen to the live music and have a few drinks. We really loved the decor, vibe and music. However, the service was garbage. Having never been there, which we told our server, a recommendation was requested on what would be good to drink. Our waitress, who was clearly uninterested, said ""everything"". Very helpful (sarcasm intended). We asked for waters after we ordered our drinks, and were told that this bar doesn't give water, but we could buy bottled for $10 each! It was 104 at 8pm! The icing was when we got our bill, $165, we each had 1 drink, and a 18% gratuity was tacked on!! At no time was that mentioned. We were pretty pissed, we tried talking to the waitress, who at this time was less than interested in what we had to say. As we were leaving we saw the ""punchbowl"" special that would have been more economical and enjoyable way for us to drink. Poor service, especially for locals who like to go out and find new Vegas experiences! ",0,1,0,0,0

 If you like Olive Garden, you'll love Pasta Cucina except for the TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! Our waiter was present to take our orders, never refilled our water, didn't deliver our food, didn't check on us, and straight up disappeared. We waited almost 20 minutes to get our checks after we finished and had to ask one of the bussers to find the guy. While staying at Sunset Station, I saw an ad for Pasta Cucina and decided to try it out. I went with a couple friends and we ordered the Meatball Sliders, Fried Mozzarella, Baked Penne, and Lasagna. Nothing exceptional, but all edible. FYI: the penne, lasagna, and breadsticks keep well in the fridge for a few days and heat up well! Each item was under $10, which was cool!

 The Tipsy is not generally a bad bar; in fact usually it's great. However, there have been some serious problems when they run Trivia on Mondays, that may reveal bigger problems with their hosting practices. Simply put, they cannot manage table allocation when they're busy, and they do not put fairness or efficiency high on their list for seating. Our team went every Monday night for months, becoming familiar faces in the process. But as trivia became more popular, we had to show up earlier and earlier to ensure we'd get a table. This is in part due to Tipsy's policy that at least half of a party must be present to be seated -- and worse, that they can't even put their names on a list until that point. Pretty soon we were coming close to an hour ahead of time, and we'd often wait most or all of it. We were usually a big party, and as such we tried to be predictable, patient and compliant, but too often we were told tables couldn't be put together, or were forgotten about, or we watched as multiple smaller parties would be ushered in ahead of us, all with curt, inattentive service from the hosts. Finally, on a particular night when the whole gang was there a full hour ahead of time, we immediately indicated we wanted a table. We waited for 45 minutes as we occasionally checked in with half-aware staff distributing long-empty tables, then were told there was a table opening up that we could get in 5-10 minutes. Scouting revealed the party in question had finished their food and signed their check some time ago, and were just sitting chatting. After 15 minutes had gone by, we asked whether the hostess might politely mention to them that others were waiting to be seated, but she laughingly informed us that wasn't possible. 10 minutes after that, we asked again what the status was, and the hostess blithely informed us that we'd actually been second on the list, and that OUR table would be opening up shortly -- it would probably be another 5-10 minutes. We left, and have not gone back for trivia. However, even without considering that we were regular customers, their behavior seemed so rude and cavalier that many of us have developed pretty negative feelings about them. After all, it was really the culmination of a string of problems, not an isolated incident; and we felt they could have managed not just more efficiently, but more sympathetically. To some this might sound whiny, but as a former server myself at a similar establishment, I just couldn't believe how little weight they seemed to be giving customer experience. Maybe they thought as long as they were busy, they didn't have to care. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Super friendly. He remembered my name in only 3 visits. Usually when not busy he will see me come up and prep my items before I even walk up. Super convenient! Other than that. Nice job on cleaning however they dont actually do the cleaning on site....it gets taken off premises. At least I believe thats what he said. I had my jeans hem and sweat pants repaired (I split my bottoms and the pocket had a hole in them) it cost $10 for each item. The pants looks like new :) and my jeans fit. (Im short so I usually have to get my jeans hem or I have to roll them up.) They will ask you if you plan on wearing heels...or not so they can make it a little longer to make it fit well. Very considerate...considering I told them to hem it shorter until they brought this to my attention and then I agreed. A little longer so heels work better :) A+ on service and good work so far on items. Never had anything missing (expect a button but they sewed one on for free since it was missing) :) ",0,0,0,0,1

 What a nice place! While in Charlotte visiting family, I decided to yelp a place to find a tasty birthday cake. After getting some sushi we drove down to Amelie's, and for a while I was concerned that we were headed in the wrong direction - the area was pretty sparse and industrial looking. But when we pulled up and I saw the cute little porch I knew it would be good. The interior is artsy and adorable, with a touch of class. I'm a big fan of the various chandeliers they had and of course - the sweets. What yummy looking sweets, served up by a friendly staff. I got a free eclair for it being my birthday, and chose a big fat chocolate cappucino/rum cream cake. Then we had some french pressed coffee. Overall, I'd say the sweets I had were decent, not amazing. The cake was a bit dry but still yum. If I'm ever in Charlotte again though I'll definitely have to bring some friends to this place, The atmosphere is simply lovely. The best part? It's open 24 hours. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Great location, great suites, great conference center! Location: Located right on the strip, The Venetian is centrally located to popular destinations such as the Wynn/Encore, Treasure Island, Fashion Mall, Caesars Palace and more! You won't run out of any activities and with the shops at the Palazzo you may not even need to leave the confines of the hotel for shopping, dining or entertainment. Suites: All the rooms at the Venetian are full sized suites. That means separate living/bedroom area and huge bathroom complete with marble fittings. A basic suite has 3 flat screen TV's (one for the living room, one for the bedroom and one for the bathroom...so no need to worry about fighting over the remote control! Depending on the location of your suite the views are impressive! Conference Center: The Venetian holds one of the largest conventions centers on the strip. Overall it's a great event space. My one only gripe is at times the air can get stuffy and dry with a weird perfume scent throughout the entire building. Overall the Venetian is a great place to get your party or your conference on in Vegas. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Three of us tried to go here last night for a birthday celebration. I made reservations via phone earlier in the week. My friend arrived early to check-in. They denied our reservation, and the hostess was extremely rude. Another friend that was with us said a similar thing happened to her a few weeks earlier when she tried to go with a group of 5 for another bday party. This type of behavior is completely unacceptable especially for a restaurant/restaurant group of this caliber. If you don't want to take reservations, then fine, but it's poor business to allow patrons to plan a night to fail at your expense. If you do mess up a reservation, then try to accommodate the customer rather than treating them like they are at fault. Needless to say, none of my friends will ever be trying this restaurant. There are too many good restaurants with good customer service to deal with this treatment. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This place overlooks the US National Whitewater Center's main activity area. It is an absolutely gorgeous view come sunset and perfect on Thursday nights during the summer when they have free live entertainment. I have been to the USNWC before but never ate at this place. It did not disappoint, we had quick seating and service. They had a nice beer selection---not overbearing like some other places and the prices weren't too high. My group had an appetizer of fried pickles with ranch dipping sauce which was great (you really cant go wrong with that) I had the Apple Walnut Chicken Salad -Marinated grilled chicken atop spring mix with apples, crumbled bleu cheese and candied walnuts with Balsamic Vinaigrette Fantastic salad! It was very refreshing and the candied walnuts added a nice sweet touch to contrast the apples. And I am all for any kind of crumbled cheese! I was looking at the hummus plate but needed something cool and refreshing and this hit the spot! I definitely recommend this place, the service was good, food was great and you cannot beat the location. Go on a Thursday or Saturday night during the summer and there is live music and you can hang around after and just chill. So happy Charlotte has this place! ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place is Ratchet with a capital R! I'm with Joel J. - I don't get all the hype or the 4 star rating for Vanguard Lounge. I came here with a group of four people on a Saturday night around 12:30AM. This is prime time people. The Groupon I bought earlier the same night is what brought me to Vanguard. Pros: There's no cover charge. Cons: There's no cover charge, so the place is even more so infested with hoodlums. When our group walked in, we were immediately turned off by the music that was playing (hip-hop) and the plain, unattractive layout of the bar. The place was empty-ish, but after about 30 minutes a tidal wave of partiers entered. The place was so packed that we were constantly being bumped into. I had a mild panic attack as we were leaving because I had to squeeze, push, and fight my way through the dance floor to get out of the club and breathe some fresh air. Did I mention I'm slightly claustrophobic? Vanguard is in a great location. It's located smack dab on the main Fremont drag next to Insert Coins and the Beat Coffeehouse. It's convenient to stop by if you're bar hopping along East Fremont, but the centralized location is pretty much the only positive thing about Vanguard. Service at the bar was okay. We were served relatively quickly considering how busy it was. I ordered 4 Irish Trash Cans (A Long Island with Blue Curacao and Peach Schnapps). The total came to $48. I was peeved at the $12 a piece price tag, especially since the drinks were served in dinky little plastic cups. I mean, c'mon, I could go to the much classier Wayfarer bar across the street and pay the same amount for a drink that tasted and looked a million times better. There's nothing going for Vanguard. I definitely won't come back. Everyone in my group thought the place sucked. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1 is that the bartenders were quick and they didn't hassle me about my Groupon. Oh yeah and the 20% off the first order for the Yelp Check in is a Pro too. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Banh mi sandwiches were small, bread wasn't that good, and overall I was very underwhelmed. The ones at that place by UNLV are SO much better! I had the house special.. it was pretty gross. The meats were icky, hard to chew, and tasted god awful. The pork one was ok, but didn't compare to others I've had. The fiance added some coconut ""paradise"" shrimp to the order.. they were GROSS. The shrimp were mushy .. no shape to them at all.. just like eated mashed shrimp. Overall I'd stick to other banh mi places in the future.. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We had a great time at Lupie's tonight. We originally were headed to The Diamond restaurant, but could not find a place to park the car. So, we decided to try Lupies. We hadn't been to Lupie's in a number of years. There were three of us and we were seated immediately. Just as quickly as we were seated our waiter arrived to see what we would like to drink. He took our drink order and came back very quickly. Roast Pork was the special tonight, but the waiter told us that they were out of the pork, but had chicken and dumplings. I hadn't had their chicken and dumplings in quite a long time. I had the chicken and dumplings and my wife had the chili and slaw hamburger. (They can now cook your burger to your order- a big improvement.) We were very happy with our choices. They were delicious. The only negative was that they are very generous with their portion size and I was reluctant to stop eating. Shame on me! However, it was so tasty I wasn't able to stop. My compliments to the chef and their staff. The food couldn't have been any better and the service was great. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I WANT to love this place. I work nearby and tried the order online/pickup route. I'm on an HCG diet ...so it was $14 for a Chinese food rice size box of veggies with an ounce of meat. You get used to over -paying on HCG. The HCG diet is full of disappointing lunch take out options - but hey - with this I could go the pick up route and specify no cheese, sauce on the side etc. The website makes you pay with a credit card but when I showed up for pick up, I was told I had to pay at the store. The food was ok. but I noticed 2 days later I was double charged. I tried to call and complain but while on hold for the manager I was hung up on. I gave them a 2nd chance today. I paid $20+ today for a $6 12 oz juice drink (I have a cold..am obviously also in the wrong business) and a $10 lunch entree minus cheese, nuts and olives. I picked up my order but they didn't have my juice..,,when I asked, they quickly found it in the fridge. I left, confident because my box had the name of my dish written on the side. Got back to work and it was completely wrong. It had cheese, it had black beans and essentially made me super sad I gave them a second chance and spent $14 on a box of spinach and shrimp where I picked around half of it off. Overall I'm just disappointed - wondering where my money went and had that sad, shitty monday where you opened up an entree box and see a bunch of stuff you can't eat. I have expectations - I waited tables a ton and my parents owned a restaurant. I just expect $20 food when I buy $20 food. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I can't seem to go to Las Vegas and not stop in this place. It has never failed for a good time when I want a drink and a good time without getting on the fancy shirt. Like most places I am a fan of, there is live music which is pretty good and a casual atmosphere. The music is mostly Irish folk songs and easily blended recent covers with a lovely young woman dancing traditional Irish dance on stage (her feet are dizzying fast.) As many other Irish pubs there is wood decor, Guinness on tap, and a sprinkle of the nightly drunken fistfight. I think they serve food too, although i have never been there to eat. I will see you again my Nine friends. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The B&B group has garnered a lot of accolades ever since Chef Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich partnered up and created some of the best restaurants in the United States. Babbo, Lupa, Esca, Casa Mono, Tarry Lodge, Del Posto, Osteria Mozza, Pizzeria Mozza, Chi Spacca, Bar Jamon, Becco, Carnevino, OTTO Enoteca Pizzeria, B&B Ristorante, and the massive Eataly. So when I heard they opened a casual burger and beer restaurant in Vegas, I had to try it. Being lenten season, I gave up red meat, rice, and pork. So no burger for me, but luckily, they do serve lobster roll. I went on my last day in Vegas for lunch with my new found friends at the seminar that I was attending. I ordered the lobster roll and nutella shake. Both were wonderful! The lobster was sweet and cooked perfectly, it has a nice coat of mayo but not overpowering. The bread was great, nice light golden brown crisp on the outside and has a nice chew on the inside. Perfect bread to lobster ratio. Great in every single way. The nutella was uber rich, not in a bad way but my goodness, this shake is pure awesomeness. It was very hearty to say the least. It just hit the spot. wonderful shake! Now with the food reviewed, let's talk about the restaurant itself. It feels ""forced"". I felt that they did not have to open a type of restaurant like this, it's stuff into a corner of the Venetian. This is not the typical restaurant they open, it's too casual, to the point where the staff seems like fresh graduates from high school. No service at all. One of the diner had use one of the chairs to put all our bags into it, the manager asked us if he can take the chair back because they ""may"" use it. The place was half empty, this itself is not typical B&B service. The kid servers just stand there and talk to each other like it's high school once again. When we asked for the bill, it took 22 minutes to get our bill and another 3 minutes to run the card. I would skip this restaurant. It's a polar opposite from my dinner at Carnevino. Yes, totally different restaurant but service in any restaurant should be consistent, especially when they're own by the same group. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I went to the water park on a scorching Saturday afternoon and had a decent time there. I rated this place 3 stars because. The Waterpark is good. The environment is great and their lifeguards are on check (like they should be). The service is awful. Full of attitude by teenagers. (Patience is required... they're just kids) these kids act like they get fired if an ice cream cone is missing so they're very assertive. Try leaving around 7pm bc it turns into a teen night ordeal. No drinks or food allowed. The slides are good but I do think the prices for the park and food are a bit steep for all my issues. The little kid area is a bit small so if you are planning to bring a kid under 4 you might just want to save you're money. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I saw the mixed reviews, and thought, let's give it a chance. It's close, it has delivery, and I might get lucky. Even after placing the order with the lady who didn't speak a lick of English (and had to call back to repeat our credit card number six times), I thought ""Hey, she can't speak English, it must be authentic!"" Well, that logic fell short. The sushi rolls were by far the worst I've had in a while. I'm not being a snob. I've been satisfied with sushi from supermarkets -- but this place just doesn't cut it, especially for the prices. As for the other items: salad dressing, bleh. Miso soup, alright. Tempura, bland. On the positive side, I've heard that poor quality sushi means lower mercury content! So here's to my health. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Background: Hey, I lived in the Iowa for a year and a half with an expense account. I know good beef. The best corn-fed beef on the planet. \ r \ r So where the heck does BOA get it's meat? They had better keep it secret because it's more than good. It's just about the best cut of meat I've ever had. Oh, and defintely some of the most expensive. \ r \ r Vegas makes me think ""all show, no go."" I've had numerous meals here which make me think, ""...ok, the food sucked, but the people are so pretty and well-dressed."" BOA is definitely an exception. \ r \ r Tender. Flavorful. Without fail. Eyebrows will raise. Conversations cease. \ r \ r You choose a cut, a rub and a sauce. I had the Kobe flat iron steak with foie gras butter. I also had some of my friend's bone-in ribeye (peppercorn rub) and some bone-in filet (peppercorn rub). \ r \ r Sauces? I noticed that most of the table didn't really have much of their sauce. Everyone was just enjoying the meat too much. \ r \ r In most cases, all of the guests at my 12 person table declared the meat to be the best steak they could remember. Most of these folks had been to Trotter's and Luger's at least once. \ r \ r The sides and salads are definitely good, but who cares. MEAT. \ r \ r Ambience - very swanky LA feel. Dark. Pretty people. Oppressively attractive hostess. Even if you hate that stuff, eat here anyway. \ r \ r SF Alternatives: the bone-in ribeye at Bob's Steak and Chop House (Omni Hotel). ",0,0,0,1,0

 I went to Crepe Bar with a friend earlier this weekend and must say that if I lived in the east valley, this place may be my number one breakfast spot. We shared the breakfast burrito crepe and the vanilla bean crepe with strawberries and walnuts. The breakfast burrito crepe was delicious, it was spicy, salty, bacon -y, and all around awesome. The only thing I think is a little funny is that it doesn't really need the crepe (I know, blasphemy!), The eggs on their own would have bean equally as delicious. The sauces were wonderful as well. The sweet crepe was also very tasty, but definitely did not hold up to the other. It was much smaller than the breakfast burrito, but it had a subtly sweet flavor....it didn't hit you in the face with the sweetness, I think because of the buckwheat crepe maybe. Anyway, I would definitely return for breakfast! So why only 4 stars? The coffee.....the coffee was really acidic and I didn't love it so much....I was glad it was free with my Yelp check in (thanks Yelp!). ",0,0,0,1,0

 Drove here in a rental and saved a $40 round trip cab ride from Mandalay Bay, to celebrate a bday. Made reservations for a Tuesday night and mentioned the special occasion to the host. There was live entertainment that night with a guy singing oldies. The dining room and bar areas were rather small. Food: Gf ordered the salmon and said it was very good and I had the med size cut of prime rib which was more than enough for a guy with a hearty appetite, but tasted just average at best. We each had a salad and shared a bottle of wine & two sides. The asparagus was a bit overcooked and the Irish white cheesy potatoes were bland. Even though the service was pretty good, my lasting impression of this restaurant will be of the little things. I've been to dozens of 4+ star restaurants to celebrate special occasions and most serve complementary desserts to the guest of honor, which is always a nice touch, but nothing here. Not even a HBD acknowledgement from our server. Menu overpriced and no wow factor. I would not have come here if not for a Groupon promotion. Most resorts in Vegas have excellent steakhouses. I suggest you pass on this place. ",0,1,0,0,0

 WORSE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!! Don Tuck and the manager Tim were horrible. We were quoted several different amounts, and when we finally got to the end stage he said a final amount that was $100 more!!! During the sales process, we were VERY clear about buying 2 chairs and on the final sales ticket the 2 chairs were not included. At the end when we were upset about hearing a higher final amount that what we were quoted, Don ""checked with his manager"" and decided they didn't want to sell to us. He told us he's off the clock and that Ashley doesn't NEED OUR BUSINESS. I've never been treated this way in sales industry. Don't waste your time, go to Room Store next door - that's what we should have stuck to. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Excellent take-out and ordering. Always fast and ready at the counter within 5-10 minutes, quick counter service and out the door :) I don't like eating in much; kids etc... So I order for pick up a lot. They're just very consistant and the food is always stellar and I continue to come back time and time again. I want to tell a story about once I forgot my wallet at home and later when driving home from the office I wanted dinner.. called ahead ordered food.. got in and realized I didn't have my wallet. I felt like an idiot. In my stupor I assumed I had to drive home and return later to grab my cold food or re-order again. There was a manager sitting close by at the end of the counter and realized what I forgot. He asked if I've been there before and I said ""yeah all the time actually"", not like he was really concerned but he ended up telling me ""don't worry about it"" and to take the food w/o paying. I made sure he was serious and I thanked him a few times and went home. I ate... got my wallet and drove back. He wasn't around (in back somewhere) but I told the girl what I ordered and she was a little shocked that I came back. Anyways... I paid and went back home. I know $14 or so for the meal wasn't a massive hit to the biz if I never came back... but the point is he hooked a brother up in need. It's just a cool mentality to have as a manager / biz owner and I appreciated it and I won't ever forget it. Thanks manager guy... you've got a customer for good. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place is really great. I stopped by for breakfast during a trip up to Montreal for Pouzzafest. I ended up ordering the Choco-Strawberry-Banana Cr \ u00eape and I definitely did not regret it. The fruit toppings were nice and fresh and the cr \ u00eape was made just the right way. My friends each tried some of the other offerings including the choco-strawberry and a couple of the savory options. All feed back on the food was positive.

 Though I've never been to Amsterdam (the country), I don't quite see the connection to Amsterdam (the club). I've heard in Amsterdam (the country) you're able to buy both cannabis and a whore right out in the open. Yet at Amsterdam (the club), I've yet to see this happen. Tho I have seen some slutty looking dudes who perhaps are wearing a hemp inspired cologne as they leave a restroom stall. So perhaps Amsterdam (the country) is as famous for their amazing martinis as Amsterdam (the club). Not sure. But the boys, the booze and the beat at Amsterdam (the club) are top notch in the Phoenix club scene.

 Bottom line, this course is not worth the money. There are to many courses in the Charlotte area to chose from that are in much better condition. These were the worst greens I have ever played on and I have played some pretty bad ones in my 20 years of golf.

 We had a half day off in downtown Phoenix and I decided that I would forego all of the close options and mind Mexican. We have been on the East Coast for about 6 weeks and I need to get my fill. Off to Yelp I go and found La Canasta. Exactly what I am looking for. A 1.5 mile walk later and I am at the front door. Uh-oh. What does that hand-written sign say? Close at 8:00 PM. Out comes the phone. Exactly 8:00 PM. I enter anyways. They ask if I want food to go. I said I would rather eat in. No problem. Grab a seat. You just need to pay first. No problem. They took me in with no one else in the restaurant. I quickly ordered and quickly had my food. Most of it was too hot (temperature) to eat. That is a good thing. I went simple with a chicken taco and cheese enchilada. The cook came out after 5 minutes and asked me if it was all good. He encouraged me to use the salsa in the bottle as it was great. It was. Chips and salsa were super great. Warm, light chips and 2 great salsas. Iced Tea was alright. Passable. Not best ever, but good enough. Service was great seeing that they let me in after they were shutting down. This seems to be a family owned place that has been around for awhile. Definitely worth the 3.0 mile walk in total.

 These guys are awesome! When my air conditioner stop working they came out, found the issue (melted wire) and fixed it, for FREE! The two guys that came to my house were knowledgeable, friendly, and didn't look like criminals (like they sometimes do with other companies). I left a star off due to the length of time it took them to come out to look at the issue, two days.

 Food: Like the name says, it's burgers and fries. Mostly. Your options are: Hamburger, Cheeseburger, Bacon Burger, Bacon Cheeseburger, Hot Dog, Grilled Cheese, Regular Fries and Cajun Fries. They also offer ""little"" versions of the burgers, meaning one patty instead of two. They offer up a list of toppings so you can create your own perfect burger: Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Green Pepper, Grilled Onion, Grilled Mushrooms, Pickles, Ketchup, Mustard, Relish, A-1 Sauce, Mayo, Jalapeno Peppers, Bar-B-Q Sauce and Hot Sauce. The patties are always well-done. I generally prefer ""med-rare"", since most places that say ""well-done"" really mean ""drier than the Sahara"" Not so here. I have never, never had a more juicy burger. It dripped. A Lot! And the flavor was simply fantastic. By far, it was the best burger I have ever had. It was a bit much to handle though as these are not small burgers. Getting your mouth from bottom bun to top is no small feat. The fries were also fantastic. I like that they are freshly cut, actual potatoes and that they're fried up in peanut oil. There's a sign by the order counter that proudly proclaims where that days spud's arrived from. They come in two sizes ""regular"" and ""large"". I ordered the regular and ended up with a styrofoam cup filled with fries, plus two more large handfuls in the bottom of the bag. Drinks: Standard fountain sodas. Seating: Plentiful. They have tables and chairs, and plenty of them. There's also a bar table that runs the length of a back wall complete with stools. Atmosphere: The place has bright white tile with red accents, various ""best of"" articles, mostly from the Washingtonian magazine and large red on white signs proclaiming their awesomeness. The lighting is bright, the walls are bright, and everything is brand-new-squeaky-clean looking. We'll see if it stays that way, serving the college crowd. Staff: Very friendly Miscellaneous: The first time I went here, I ordered my burger specifically without tomatoes. I'm allergic to them. When I got my food there was a bright red (very fresh looking) tomato merrily laying on my burger. I simply brought it back up to the counter and told them what the trouble was. The manager was completely cool about it and ran a brand new one out to me a couple minutes later. They have boxes full of peanuts stacking in strategic locations in the restaurant, complete with little metal pails to carry a pile of peanuts to your table. If you have a peanut allergy, this is not the place to be. There's even a sign on the door that says so. Overall: This is the way a burger joint is meant to be. Fast, Simple, Delicious. Watch out Dotty's, Five Guys will be giving you a run for the ""best burger"" in this years ""Best of Madison"". ",0,0,0,0,1

 The Cosmo is beautiful on the outside and the slots always look shiny and new. Sadly, the layout, colors, decor, and table games suck.
