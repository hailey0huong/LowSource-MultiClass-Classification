 This location is the only one I've been to and I would recommend it. I usually come for dinner and I would say there's about 10 - 15 minute wait on weekends but the staff is friendly and courteous, the food is good and prices are reasonable. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This restaurant is very small and tucked away in a little shopping center, but the food is very good. The wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive. They fill up fast though, so don't get there right at dinner time. My favorite so far is the sausage mushroom rigatoni, but I've also enjoyed their lasagne, manicotti and baked ziti. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've been here dozens and DOZENS of times over the last 25 years. 5 stars without a doubt. Standouts are the Italian beef with ""lots o hot"". Their cheese fries are absolute perfection... here's why. Put fries in a basket, smother them with cheese sauce, put another hand full of fries in basket, SMOTHER AGAIN WITH CHEESE SAUCE. When you are done with these cheese fries you are looking for more fries for the cheese, not more cheese for the fries. Then, when you walk out, school girls and boys break into song and birds start chirping. Oh, I have to mention the cheese steak. I don't like the standard way they do it (beef, onions, cheese) BUT if you ask for it ""Philly Style"" they do it with their cheese sauce that they add extra cheddar cheese to. Yum yum yum.

 I don't get it? Why the five stars? Being from NY I know pizza. This is not great pizza. Is it because it is so fast? There is nothing wrong with the place but nothing to write home about either. I think of this place as the McDonalds of pizza. They advertise fast and it is. I got a Mini Tristan and a salad and a drink and it cost 11 dollars. I don't know. That is not a cheap lunch for leaving hungry and fast food pizza. I did notice on the way out they had these cool looking Ice Teas and Lemonade. I was intrigued by the sound of a Caramel Pear Tea and the Blackberry Lemonade. They were both Delish. I would go back just for those if I was close by. Another annoyance, the place was dirty. It looked like it had been three months since they dusted the railings where the tables are connected to. ( They have been open for three months) I have to admit the staff members were very friendly. This strip mall has a lot of great options so not sure it will last. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We made reservations here since we were seeing a concert at the MGM Arena. I highly recommend making reservations online before coming since there were many people waiting to get a table. But that being said, I wouldn't recommend the food. Here it goes... we started off with the pretzel and cheese appetizer. Pretzels good but the cheese was not. Bummer. I had ordered the nachos off of the appetizer menu. Honestly I wish he would have told me how huge this was. I could've been split easily between 4 people. This jicama relish on top was not very good. Spending this much on nachos I was hoping was something tastier. My husband ordered the Champ burger... a $19 burger. Was it worth it? Nope. I had a taste and was disappointed. The service on the other hand was impeccable. There were constantly people coming over to refill our drinks. Our food was out quickly and our waiter was very friendly and professional. $70 later, you would think it would have been a better meal. Bummed. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I had one of the most satisfying all around meals I've ever had at this restaurant and I cannot wait to go back. I went for Pittsburgh Restaurant Week and ordered the fixed three course meal and every dish was not only something i had never tried before but was also delicious. The best part of the meal was a goat cheese and balsamic ice cream which i was nervous to try but was actually mind blowing. As it was Restaurant Week the place which is fairly small was very packed but the staff was incredibly social and very helpful in describing all of the food and wine pairings. On top of all of this I got 3 orders and three drink pairings for $30 which was incredible. I cannot speak highly enough of my all around experience here. ",0,0,0,0,1

 No question one of the best hotels if not the best in Vegas. I'm sure the MO is great in other cities also. It stands out so much more so in Vegas given that it avoids the smoke filled casinos and associated crazy patrons that they attract. Checkin was a breeze as was the valet area. It made me appreciate how much more relaxing the lobby checkin MO was when we saw the hoards lining up at MGM and other hotels on the strip. Service is impeccable. Pool is fantastic. The fitness facilities are nice with free yoga and fitness classes. Mary Jane runs a particularly energy intensive yoga class versus a more meditative one offered by the other instructor Susan on the weekend. Mozen Bistro is pretty good but you will pay a bit for enjoying a smoke free dining experience. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place was disgusting, and of course by disgusting I mean awesome. And I suppose I also mean disgusting, because lets face it, Pomeroy's is not intended for the faint of heart. A group of us came pummeling on Saturday night after Amber W. and the Second Time Ever boys were kind enough to give us a Sunnyslope Art Walk preview (which kicked ass by the way) and immediately I was hooked. $2.75 Amber Bocks ALL DAY and a late night menu with grilled cheeses, chicken fingers, and mozzarella sticks? Where do I sign up? Like seriously, that is my holy trifecta of late night bar food, and this particular bar food was delicious. And I can say that with great confidence because believe it or not, I wasn't drunk, so I could actually taste it : ) Be prepared to wait though, because the service for certain members of our party (sorry Jordan) was SLOW. Yes, the table was filthy and no one once came over to clean it. Yes, the clientele was a bit on the unwashed side. And yes, there were at least 5 people in there that wanted to kill me for no other reason that I made the mistake of walking in with a designer bag. But listen, Pomeroys make's ZERO excuses for itself, and really, what self-respecting dive bar should? That said, before my next visit to Pomeroys, I will dirty myself up a bit and dress in the finest wife beater I own, and it will be on, because no amount of salty bar patrons will stand between me and my $2.75 Amber Bocks, so don't even try...

 It's not bad. They make a decent cup of coffee. More positives: pastries are affordable; ample seating; nice back patio area; baristas are pretty cool.

 Friend took me here for lunch today - treated me as it is my birthday - YAY. The food was just okay, with an unpleasant surprise. Our initial order was taken quickly. We ordered a couple spring rolls - pretty standard rice paper wrapper with shrimp, vermicelli noodles, and lettuce inside along with a hoisin dip. It also included a dead baby fly inside one of the rolls...GROSS. Maybe because it's my birthday, I didn't even get upset over it. I just moved on (didn't even tell my friend). I thought ""Okay, maybe it was in the lettuce and it just didn't get rinsed out enough..."" I stopped eating that roll and checked the inside of the other, fly free. We also ordered some kind of stir fry with various seafood and veggies. That was okay. My friend was still hungry, so he ordered a bowl of congee, which was kinda blah. The real reason I'm giving this place 1 star is for the dismal service we received. Nick V. is spot-on about the rude and slow service. While our initial order was taken quickly, when the food came out it was also dropped at the edge of our table and the server left without looking at us. It took several ""Excuse me please"" along with hand raising from my friend to get an extra plate so he could share his food with me. When he told one individual he wanted to order something more, there was an actual eye-roll! The menu was extended, then tossed onto a nearby table when my friend ordered his congee. When it came out, a young Asian girl brought it out, shoved it on the table, and when my friend said, ""May we have some spoons and an extra bowl so we can eat it,"" the girl literally stared right at his face with absolutely NO emotion for a good moment. Then grabbed a couple spoons from another table and tossed them on our table. Really? Nick V., please don't assume it's a cultural thing. Both my friend and I are Asian, and we were appalled at the behavior. It was so bad, it was actually funny, in a sad, pathetic way. I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN. I also agree that Pho Avina has EXTREMELY nice owners and servers, along with great food, and THEY will have my continued patronage. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The Cheesecake Factory is definitely on my list of favorites....Ive never been to this location before and I was in the area so I decided to give it a try. The service was great, our waiter was very attentive, and the food was pretty good although my shrimp was a bit over cooked (I had the shrimp and chicken gumbo)...one thing that really bothered me was how filthy their silverware was (there was pieces of leftover food on my spoon and butter knife). I asked my waiter for an extra set of silverware and cup of hot water to soak them in...problem solved...I don't live in this area so I'm sure I won't be returning to this location ",0,1,0,0,0

 When I first heard I was going to the Shiloh Grill, I had images of men led by Ulysses S. Grant with Grizzly Adams beards chomping into hardtack along the Tennessee River. Post visit, I can confidently report that the Shiloh Grill seems to be an easy going hangout where locals might go to enjoy friendly service and decent food. So leave your Enfields at camp. I'm sure even you will be welcome here. The restaurant is only a short walk from the Monongahela incline, so it should be on the radar of tourists who are taking in the view of Pittsburgh from atop Mt. Washington. The menu is a cleverly written culinary compendium full of local references interspersed with lascivious overtones. But it's all in a SpongeBob SquarePants kind of way, so relax. The building is of the type that belongs among popular seaside destinations. Wood shingles, an upraised deck and an inviting bar were all reminiscent of time well spent on Cape Cod. And as a New Englander, it struck me as a tad out of place, but it still seems to work - unlike the fireplaces, which are totally for show. There's supposedly an element of the supernatural entwined in the building's history, but I'll let the natives speak to the veracity of Pittsburgh's ghostly lore. My GF and I arrived at the Shiloh Grill about an hour before a family reunion of sorts. Like good bar flies, we spent the hour at the watering hole, chatting with our amiable bartender, who was not only a discerning beer enthusiast, but was also skilled in the fine art of mixology. We were seated upstairs as the appointed hour neared. And since we had spent our afternoon shopping, among the wares we brought into the restaurant were a few bottles of Bordeaux. Well, maybe more than a few. When we were seated, our waiter charged us a nominal cork fee, so we were able to enjoy our own vino and were not beholden to the limited wine menu. Now onto the food. Did I eat healthy? Hardly. That's not possible in Pittsburgh. My Salad de la Burgh came with fries and veritable mountains of shredded provolone and mozzarella cheeses. It also came with marinated chicken tenders, which were cooked just right and retained ample flavor. So overall, I was very satisfied. A great location, friendly staff and tasty food urge me to give the Shiloh Grill 5 stars, but the lack of a skyline view (come on, it's Mt. Washington!) and the sheer concentration of competitors offering comparable food in more scenic locales compel me to make deductions. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I looove place Milton! Very relaxed ambiance and friendly service. The order are always super quick to arrive and the portions generous. We used to go to Cora on Park, Place Milton replaced it. More classic then Cora, it serves 'traditionnal breakfasts'. I totally recomand this place if you are looking for an easy spot for hard week-end mornings! The only downside to this place is that it is not spotless clean. The also have a nice terrace in the back to enjoy your breakfast in an intimate outside spot. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was just writing a review for Triple C and realized I have never written a review for Noda. Personally, this is hands down, my favorite brewery in Charlotte. I am an IPA drinker so maybe I am a little biased as they have an abundance (but never to many in my opinion) of IPA's. I prefer their original nodaryzed myself but also enjoy the Woody and Wilcox, Ghost Hop, and the new Pacific Reign. All are super hoppy and just the way I love them to be. All are higher gravity so be careful. They typically have one of the amazing food trucks of Charlotte in there parking lot too, as well as a grill outside for you to bring your own meats to grill out. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We arrived at PH on Thursday night to check in to our room (that had already been previously paid for). We were asked if we wanted to upgrade our room for $20 per night. We said that would be great and I left my debit card open in case we wanted room service. A day later I checked my balance and they had taken $400 as a deposit. I was in disbelief. So I called down to have them close my card out and bill me for the $20 per night upgrade. Now they inform me there are $24 per night resort fees. Was never told about these charges either. Plus, I already paid my resort fees when I initially paid for the room. So why am I being billed for something twice? They couldn't give me a straight answer to that question. So after the $20 upgrade per night, the $24 resort fee per night, and the tax...I had a $185 room upgrade. Honestly, that's not a bad upgrade fee for being on the 37th floor (one floor below the penthouse) with a Vegas Strip view. I am not upset about that. I am really upset about the $400 deposit and the lack of information given at the time of the upgrade. Overall, the room was extremely clean, and very nice. King Size bed was very comfortable. We hardly heard any street noise. A/C was very quiet and cooled the room very quickly. Bathroom was very clean. Be sure to ask all the details of an ""upgrade"" before agreeing. You may not like all of the hidden fees that started out as a simple ""$20 upgrade"". ",0,0,1,0,0

 Excellent food, all the way around. This is the kind of place you expect to have paper towels on your table, and you do, and you'll need them and love that you do. I lived in DC for a few years and there were a lot of pollo a la brasa joints all around there that I became addicted to, and miss. This is very close in flavor, if a different cultural tone. Totally recommend this for an inexpensive, delicious, and low-maintenance meal with close friends. Knowing basic Spanish is probably helpful. ",0,0,0,0,1

 So, how would I end up in Montreal at the Napoli Pizzeria? Who knows really, maybe it was the large gathering of other nerds who were in town to talk to each other about get this (babies, development, and psychopathology). I know right. What the heck does that have to do with traveling all the way to Napoli. Well, it really has nothing to do with that but it really justifies the long trip from New Orleans to here. About the venue, it's cute, small, and has a large tree placed right in the middle of the room. This tree is adorned with glowing grapes that if your lucky are all flickering. The food, I started my night with the french onion soup, and it was unlike any other kind I've ever had. It was slightly sweet but in a different way than most. It wasn't bogged down with cheese like some are so that was nice too. We also ordered a pizza that was delicious and nicely cooked. The pizzas are larger than you would think and if you are with someone else they will split whatever you order on two plates so you even get your own servings! We ordered the medium and we both had two full pieces to take home. So, if you go with someone else you could get away with the small pizza and a salad, or soup or something alike.

 When fellow friend Richard G. raved and raved about how good Earl of Sandwich is and how he'd eat it any day and everyday, I thought he was just obsessed. I've had other people tell me Earl of Sandwich is good, but that was it, it was just ""good."" I'm a big fan of sandwiches so I was coming into this place with some pretty high expectations. And sure as hell, Earl of Sandwich delivered. I want to say this place ranks in my top 3 (along with Ike's and Mendocino Farms in SF and LA respectively), but where in the top 3, I'm not so sure (I'm so conflicted). But yes, the Full Montagu is a must get! I'm not a fan of mustard, but a;ofhusfo;ahfouef Earl of Sandwich, you did something right if I'm in love with a sandwich that is heavily dosed with mustard. My sandwich was absolutely perfect, love the crunch of the bread and how everything just melts and comes together in your mouth. No doubt, it's an amazing sandwich. They say the line can get long, but came by Saturday afternoon and beat the lunch rush, not a long wait at all. And since it's Vegas, what a steal for such good food on the strip. Open 24/7? Yeah, I'm sold. Going to try the Earl Club next time and their lemonade. And apparently dipping your sandwich in their broccoli and cheese soup makes it super good too. So that'll be the next plan. But yeah, Earl of Sandwich, you definitely earned your name. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Disappointed with this place. Have tried a few times to give them the benefit of the doubt, but too many times there have been problems.

 I'm somewhat a ramen fanatic, having already eaten at most of the Seattle ramen shops. We decided to check this place out since my brother said that this place was amazing (especially since they were a good sport to take care of a group of 20 people haha.) I'm not too big on the overly rich, highly sodium filled broths that I've experienced. I decided to play it safe and went with their shio ramen w/ light sodium. The first bite I had was amazinngggg. So warm, so chicken, so doge. The noodles were perfect in every way. Not too soft and not overly chewy, I can just easily slurp them! :) the pork was really tasty too, it was made so you could easily break it into pieces, or just have it melt in your mouth. Service was excellent, the waitress was attentive and had an adorable personality. My only complaint is the wait time. I hope they get a bigger shop soon! I highly recommend this place to any ramen lovers out there! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ya know, it's really tough to enjoy a meal when your experience with the hostess rubs you the wrong way right when you walk in the door. We met some good friends there this past Thursday, and were there to use our groupon. They have a two year old - which normally isn't even worth mentioning, but that's where it went horribly wrong with the hostess. For some reason, she looked down on us - and not just because she's taller. Basically she said they had a table in the back where we wouldn't bother anyone with the ""child"". I realize that restaurants such as these are normally quieter, more intimate, less rowdy, so it's not what she suggested, it's how she said it. Our friend's child happens to be very well behaved, but she assumed we would be a distraction or a nuisance. The fact that she was a ginger, while not affecting her poor courtesy, is still worth mentioning. The server was attentive, for the most part, with the exception of drink refills. I can't comment on the quality of the steak, because everyone I was with who ordered steak ordered it wrong (medium well / well done). The food, for the most part, was forgettable, and unfortunately, we will not be back. Luckily it was a cheap night thanks to groupon!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was pretty excited (and quite surprised) when two Valeries opened in Edinburgh - I knew them well from Old Compton St and Marylebone High St in London - both long established establishments as I understand. Though normally I would be found in Maison Betaux in Greek Street when in Soho ... I have mainly visited the Rose St branch at which I have taken to stopping at for a coffee and occasional croissant before work. Initial thoughts: - great airy space strongly benefiting from the french doors opening on to Rose Street - which needs all the help it can get (see below!) - early morning views of the street crammed with loading lorries and other traffic not that great on a ""pedestrianised"" street (don't event get me started onCastle Street!) - love the brown and beige vibe which totally reminds me of the main cafe I used to visit when I lived in Austria! - staff have been lovely each time I have been in including when I had forgotten my wallet and was short of cash by \ u00a31! - coffee: great - excellent latte - pretty strong (no flat whites: too modern?!) - I have also had a pretty good croque monsieur and a good chocolate \ u00e9clair. - croissants: ummm, a but disappointing - have tried at least 3 times but none of them tasted that fresh making me wonder if they had been baked some time earlier and delivered or even dated from the day before. Also (and note to all cafes in Edinburgh!) not a great idea to microwave any yeast/pastry-based product as I suspect had been done to my almond croissant! - Also popped into North Bridge branch for an iced coffee (sold out) and some take away cakes - felt pretty overheated and airless although was a hot day; also disappointed at the Black Forest gateuax unfortunately especially having experienced Falkos. Sponge seemed dry, almost mass produced, and no taste of kirsch! Nonetheless, feel they are a very welcome arrival in two streets which need a bit of brightening up and the window displays definitely do that. May be if the comments on here are taken on board they can up their game for 3 stars! My Yelp research tells me that the two London branches I mentioned have better reviews that Edinburgh -so far.

 Have to give a shout out to this place. Although I have only gone to ""Cocktails"" a few times in the last few years, it will always have a special place in my heart. Flash back 25 years ago. My Dad used to take me here for happy hour with his work buddies. Some may say that isn't good parenting. Maybe its not. But I have very fond memories of sitting up at the bar getting my cheeks pinched by the bartender and the patrons. The nice, smoky voiced, wrinkly blond female bartender would put a zillion maraschino cherries in my shirley temple. And I would play darts with my Daddy. I feel warm and fuzzy just thinking about it. Once I would hit adulthood I would stop in every so often. Though my life was constantly changing this bar just felt like home. Another warm fuzzy memory? My brother proposed to his amazing wife here on New Years Eve a few years ago. I wasn't there at the time, but he text me pictures after the proposal.

 Great food, small selection for me as I don't like to ""fishy"" sushi. I'm more interested in rolls, but I guess you can ask the chef to make what you need. Just not on the menu. Overall, it was great and there was hardly ever a line. ",0,0,0,1,0

 In a pinch we stayed here for NYE block party because the Marriott residence inn in downtown Tempe was booked. This turned out not to be too bad. They shuttled us to the party, but we had to walk back (about a mile) since they stop shuttle service at 10pm. A couple days after checked out i realized i had left a couple of items in our room. I called back they searched and found them. They offered to fedex it which was a nice gesture but decided to pick up instead. Overall I'm Impressed with their customer service which is always a winner in my book. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My wife absolutely loved her turkey burger, and the fries were decent if not spectacular. So why the 2 star rating? The service was absolutely awful. This was at the South End food truck meet up on Friday night. By the time we got there (8ish) the lines were dying down. My wife ordered from here while I went elsewhere to order. The line was longer where I went so by the time I got back she was already waiting for her food. Then we went to Common Market to pick up a couple of beverages. We came back and my food was just coming out. Hers was nowhere to be seen. It was another half hour before it came out. I was watching the whole time and it wasn't like they were overloaded with orders - it took them between 5-10 minutes to put out each order. Absolutely crazy! My wife liked her burger so much that she said she would eat there again, but it will have to be without me because I won't wait. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Love, love, love this place!!! The food is delicious! Everything I've tried has always been amazing! The bento boxes are a great size with lots of food (choice of meat or fish, soup, salad, California roll, rice and tempura). The mango avocado salad has delicious creamy dressing!

 I have had the worst customer service experience in this store too many times to not sign up for YELP and warn others. The optometrist is nice but the staff up front have absolutely no customer service skills whatsoever. The first time I went into the store to pick up something that was previously paid for, they did not acknowledge me for 48 minutes. (Yes I times it!) When they finally asked me if they could help I was very irritated. I had to wait becuase my son really needed to see. I talked with the cashier about how they need to let customers walking in know that they will be with them as soon as possible as three customers after me had walked in and ended up leaving because nobdy acknowledged the fact they were even there. The woman just gave me a dirty look and rang me up and did not say thank you at all or apologize for the bad service. The next contact refill, I figured maybe they were just having a bad day so next time it will be better. It was worse! We waited 52 minutes before someone rang us up and once again the staff was unfriendly. They lost about a $1000 per year account with us. ",1,0,0,0,0

 It takes a lot for me to write a negative review, but I am simply baffled by all of the positive reviews this place has received. My girlfriend and I ate here for dinner and expected the food to be edible at the very least. This was not simply a matter of it being an ""off night"" - it was clear from the start that the quality of ingredients was well below what one would expect from a low grade cafeteria. The ""house balsamic"" served over iceberg was watery and flavorless. The bread tasted like cardboard. Her Penne Arrabiata was coated in a less than generous portion of bland sauce and the pasta was overcooked. My eggplant parmesan sandwich (The Favorito) was not only foul tasting, but down right bizarre - like eating the fried skin of some weird alien, not even distantly reminiscent of what i know as eggplant, served on the same crappy bread. Somehow our waitress could not comprehend that we did not want boxes. We left with full plates, empty pockets and emptier stomaches. ",1,0,0,0,0

 So my closest 17 relatives and I were going to Vegas and I wanted to try to introduce them to some interesting food that they might not otherwise try. Talking to a group like that is like herding cats! MY GAHHHD!!! It was such a loooooong, painful process! I showed them pictures, menus, prices, and spent hours deciding what to eat for our 3 days in Vegas. While talking about our dining options, I often heard: ""It's expensive!"" ""Buffet! Let's go to a buffet!"" ""That's such a small portion!"" ""Let's go to the Filipino restaurant!"" ""Umm...where else can we go?"" GEEEEZZZZ. I wanted to end my misery so I gave up persuading them to eat somewhere else. PAN SEARED SCALLOPS - Yessss, oh yeeeees...These scallops were perfectly seared, fresh and tasty! The red wine sauce was so good that I actually ate all the brussels sprouts and parsnip pear pasta that came with it. The sauce had a tremendous flavor but it didn't cover up the scallopy flavor! Is ""scallopy"" a word? Well, it should be! Nothing else was as superb as the scallops, though. COMPLIMENTARY BREAD - They gave us so much! Unfortunately it wasn't fresh off the oven. I didn't even mind if it was recycled but at least heat it up! The olive oil/balsamic vinegar it came with was spicy and wasn't good. My family, on the other hand, must've liked it cuz they inhaled most of the bread and the olive oil, maybe because the entrees were taking too long. OSSO BUCCO - This was the special that night but it wasn't that special. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, it was alright but it was thirsty. I was not impressed with the risotto it came with either, it was a little tough. A little more water all around would be great! TIRAMISU - It was decent and that's all I can say about that. PANNA COTTA - Light, silky, creamy, yummy! But it was just like many a panna cotta I've had. SERVICE - Needs improvement! We were the only customers for a while and their service was so slow. Our entrees took about 45 minutes. It got even slower when more people came in. Our waitress was MIA for so long that we asked another waiter for the dessert menu. It took about 15 minutes for everyone to decide what to get and our waitress was still missing when we were ready to order. When we asked for our waitress the waiter replied, ""She's busy."" Uhh...how about us??? We didn't want to be late to the Cirque du Soleil show! So another waiter took our order. We finally saw our waitress again when she served our dessert. I was kind of disappointed that my family chose to eat here cuz there are so many other excellent restaurants in Las Vegas. It wasn't a total bummer because the scallops kicked serious ass, the panna cotta was good, and my family liked their dishes. So in the end I guess I didn't mind so much that we had dinner here, but I don't think I could be convinced to eat here again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Creative assortment of food, huge portions, friendly staff... BabyStacks was so good we hit 'em up back-to-back days during our Vegas trip. We tried the Kahlua Pig Benedict (smoky goodness), BYOB. (built my own omelet - egg whites, bacon, spinach, cheese, topped with green sauce - HUGE), Adobo Fried Rice (wasn't a fan, but a staple for everyone else), Spam, Eggs, and Rice and Corned Beef Hash and Eggs (need no further explicative needed), and they all came with pancakes. Not your everyday buttermilk Bisquick pancakes, but pancakes the BabyStacks way. Represented in order of deliciousness, we had Butterfinger (peanut butter batter, seriously... yeah), Orange Creamsicle with cream cheese sauce (really... yeah really, that's what the ice cream man said), Almond Joy (get a glass of milk for this chocolate, coconut wonder), Smores (build me a campfire, cause I'm eating), Banana Cream (""What's that behind you?"" as I finish your monkey stack), and White Chocolate Macadamia (stick to this in cookie form).

 Beer 5 star Food 3 star Service 1 star Atmosphere 1 star Not as awestruck as I had thought I would be. Food was very hit or miss. Recommend reading the menu very well or you could get someone's attempt at a sweet savory burger that is too far in either direction to blend well. Do try the wings and the hot pretzel. The Matador was pretty good too, reminded me of a Philly steak sandwich but on a pretzel bun. My husband had the ""Meat Treat"" flat bread pizza. It was good but we had to ask the waitress where it was, she returned to tell us ""they are remaking your order, it will be up in a few (was not a few) minutes."" I realize it's Friday night, and they were busy, but after our initial seating we had to flag the waitress down for everything and then she would disappear again. Once I flagged her down, she would immediately dart off, and I'd have to say ""WAIT.."" or she'd take one person's order and leave without asking if anyone else needed anything. The ketchup that was served with the fries, was pretty awful. That needs to go. The house pop tart, tastes very much like the Pillsbury dough boy made it. I'd recognize that overly sweet vanilla icing anywhere. ",0,0,1,0,0

 A classy, fun place to go for a nice change of pace. I like cigars, and I enjoy a good drink (away from the douchebagg-y Old Town scene), and this place fits the bill well. Great selection of cigars that are well-kept in a walk in humidor, great selection of beer as well as spirits. I'm not a frequent whiskey drinker, so I can't speak to the fairness of those prices, but the smokes and beer are fairly priced in my opinion. Friendly, helpful staff (in regards to both service and making a selection)....aside from the stench left on our clothes the next day, we enjoy this place thoroughly. ",0,0,0,0,1

 If it sounds too good to be true it usually is, right? Not in the case of Vegas Club Passes--it's totally legit. I've used their services multiple times in the past few years. It's simple: first go to the site, sign up the number of people going, what days, select the clubs you wish to attend that are available, and you're halfway there. Next, Chris will text you a confirmation the day of (usually late afternoon) confirming that your group is on the guestlist or if any changes need to be made. The great thing is that if you have any questions or concerns you can text him and he responds quickly. Just make sure your group arrives to the clubs before guestlist closes or you've just totally missed the point of the whole thing and end up wasting money on cover. Ladies are usually free for the most part and depending on which club you go to you may get free drinks before midnight. Guys usually just pay half of the usual cover. The only catch for using their services is you have to go to one of the Palms clubs your first night. Moon is okay if you're feeling for more of a lounge atmosphere, I couldn't care less for Ghost Bar, but Rain is definitely the best out of the three and the biggest. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I don't like to give out 5 stars being that it's the mecca of ratings and all, but this place nailed it. It has it all, great food, great service, and great atmosphere. I was torn between the Salmon Tartini (I think that's what it was called) and the choriza enchillada. I'm pretty sure neither would be a miss, but I heard through the grapevine that their chef makes the chorizo. Thus, I was directed that way. It was a great tasting dish, perfect for my Sunday hangover. I also had a peanut butter and banana protein shake which I sucked down like the Hoover Dam! It was delicious. If you like a little live entertainment, I'd suggest hanging out at the bar and observing the very friendly, outgoing staff (all good looking women as well, always a plus!). Before I blew that hot dog stand, I grabbed a coffee to go. I don't know what it was, but it was the perfect blend of smooth and bold. I can't wait until next time to try out that Salmon! ",0,0,0,0,1

 3 stars sounds just about right for this place. If I was rating it just on the quality of the room, 3.5 or 4 might sound right, but there are too many problems with the service (moreso the hotel's policies than the people). I stayed 3 nights in a room in the Carnaval Tower. For the price (averaged about $40/night for 3 weeknights), the room was quite good. It was spacious, clean, and had a nice bathroom. Let's get to the negatives. For one, I had to pay $28 to check in early on a Tuesday. I'm sorry, but that's bullshit. I understand how things work in Vegas, and that most properties that don't charge a resort fee do charge for early check-in, but I seriously dislike paying such a fee. Fortunately for Harrah's, I also dislike waiting in line, so I paid the money in order to drop my bag off in my room, and begrudginly paid the fee. I also think the casino here straight up sucks. The machines were too tight, and for a low-roller casino, the table minimums seemed kind of high to me. $10 was the lowest minimum I found for roulette, and all of the $10 blackjack games pay 6:5 for a blackjack, which is deplorable, in my opinion. That's really not even blackjack. I didn't eat at any of the restaurants while I stayed here, because they looked unimpressive. I could go on and on about how this place bleeds every last dollar out of its customers ($4.50 for a regular coffee from Starbucks?!), but that's how Vegas works these days. It would be unfair to criticize this hotel for something every other hotel in town does. At the same time, it would be nice to find a place on the strip that really does cater to the budget-minded gambler like Harrah's and Imperial Palace claim to. I've heard things are still like that downtown, but I'm not looking to be sitting at a table with a bunch of 70 year olds, so I'm not too anxious to find out. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Hands down the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. My friend and I were in town for the weekend, so we had to hit up Primanti's. I lived in the 'burgh for about three years, and have had it before (from the dahn-tahn location) but my friend hadn't. We came in at 1pm on a Sunday, certainly not busy at all. We sat at a table by the bar for about 15 minutes being ignored until we got fed up and sat at the bar instead. My friend and I ordered a sandwich each and I asked for no cole slaw. Seeing as how I'm pretty sure that these sandwiches are not pre-made, I didn't think it was a big deal. The waitress stared blankly at the ceiling and replied ""I'll see what I can do."" Eventually, our food got there and it was okay, not the greatness I had built up to my friend. It took about 20 minutes for the waitress to bring the tab after asking for it (I almost thought about committing my first dine and ditch out of mercy). We had to flag down a different waitress to take our money. For the first time in my life, I left no tip. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Tonight I went to this location. I have been there at least 20 times over the past 2+ years since I travel to Pittsburgh a lot. Some times I have good meals/service and sometimes bad meals but I like being able to get the lunch-sized Chicken Pamesan for dinner. Tonight was a disaster. I ordered my usual lunch chicken parmesan and a small 1893 salad without olives, feta and peppers. 40 minutes later I got my meal with the chicken on top of the spaghetti on top of a lot of oil and a salad with everything with little lettuce. It was the sorriest sight. I complained about the length of time and was told a large party of 35 ordered right before me. I told the manager, Laura, that someone should have told me that I would have to wait a long time. She said the waiter wouldn't know. Obviously the kitchen staff would know. Cmon Tuesday night after 8:30 shouldn't have that wait. Why didn't they bring the salad out first. She had the audacity to not pick-up my $25 meal but offer to pay for a $10.95 entree when I have a $10 coupon. I declined because it was an insult. Walking out I mentioned about the salad being wrong and she said my original waitress didn't communicate correctly to my replacement waiter. Obviously the manager needs training too because she didn't know how to handle a disgruntled guest when her restaurant was at fault. My waiter didn't even bring me out a plate for my salad or the usual bread. I had to beg for a water refill. I told her that I was so upset I couldn't even enjoy my meal. Previous issues that I will add here..... burnt appetizers, burnt food, long time for meals, horrible service, incorrect orders, no silverware for carryout - being told the manager had the utensils locked up in the safe so that's why I had to wait almost 30 minutes for my meal to be wrapped up. So you ask why do I go back. Many times I have had great food and service - Thank you Gina for your service in the past. With too many choices I won't be back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This place is a gem. Great space, great views, great service, great food, great prices. We had a wonderful dinner. Started with olives with fresh baked breads and a rocket/parmesan/pine nut salad. Next, my wife had a skirt steak with chips (I think they were cooked in beef drippings...great flavor) and I had a mushroom, prosciutto and pea risotto. We finished with a chocolate/espresso pave and a chocolate pot with poached pear. Our dinner was accompanied by a very nice Montelpuciano (Note: the wine list is dominated by a very good selection of screw cap topped wines, and wine service consists of the bottle being set on your table -- fine by me). Everything was absolutely delicious, and the bill was only 65 pounds.

 Although my kids seem to love it here, this place is always a hit or miss. The service is never consistent. We went in today for lunch around 2pm. It was my daughter's choice for her birthday and she invited a few friends. It didn't seem too busy as we were seated quickly with no wait. There was 10 of us, 4 adults and 6 kids. After getting our drink orders it took a while for the server to come back to get our meal order. I've noticed this a few times before when it didn't look busy. They only have one or two servers working the dining area but at the same time they seem to be overworked because they're under staffed. The food was great however, we always get our fill of chips, beans, and salsa while we wait for our meal. I ordered the steak Mexicana which was delicious and cooked perfectly. Again, the server came by once to ask how everything was and if we needed refills. By the time we were done, we had to give obvious signs we were ready for our check (hubby left with the kiddies to get situated in the car, turn on AC). The server came about 5 minutes later. Our bill wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be which made me feel a little better. The food is good and priced right to fit my family's budget.

 I'm a fan of fish tacos, so this place definitely hits the spot. When I visited, I tried the Jerk Flounder Burrito and the Shrimp/Crab Dip appetizer.

 Was excited to hear that new ""premium"" outlet stores had opened in Glendale (101 Freeway @ Glendale). We waited for the Black Friday shoppers to go home and get some sleep before venturing the 45 miles from home to check them out. But first, I checked their website to see what their hours were, get directions, etc. I actually thought it was considerate of them to list the Arizona Cardinals ""Game Days"" being they're located right by the University of Phoenix stadium. HOWEVER...we got there to find that THIS game day was not listed (Sun, Nov 25th)! And guess what ~ they were charging $10 to park at the outlets, because those attending the game might park there, taking up all the free parking, and then walk over to the game. Didn't matter that we were there only for the outlet stores. But to make nice, we were given a coupon to redeem at the Service Center for a book of coupons that FAR exceeded the $10 charge to park. B...S... ~ NOT HAPPY AT ALL! And we were later to find out we weren't the only ones! So we track down the Service Center only to find a line of people that had been waiting for 25 minutes to get their wonderful coupon book. After scanning the coupons (of another shopper who was not happy about the parking fee), we found that the coupons were for 15% off a purchase of $100 or more, and not all stores at the outlets were represented. Well, I wasn't impressed by the selection of stores to warrant me EVER going back there. It takes me just about as long to go to the stores at Anthem. Now, I gave this whole situation some thought as I stewed about it for quite a while! First of all, I re-checked their website to make sure I didn't miss something, only to confirm that the day of our visit was not listed as a game day, nor was there anything about a $10 parking fee for that day. But then as I thought more about it, I thought, of course not! They are not going to let people know about the fee because the shopper will not visit that day; only the people attending the game. Thus, they will be losing out on the sales revenue. And then the more I thought about, I thought, ""So, are they going to be charging people to park every time there's an event at the stadium?"" And I have to conclude the answer is YES. So beware outlet shoppers! It's going to be a flip of a coin whether or not you're going to have to pay for parking. BTW...the stores there...not so premium.

 Just spent two nights here last week and had no issues whatsoever. Gonna keep this one short: Pros: - Great rate! $90 for a 4 person room during Spring Break. Pretty much the best deal on the strip after shitty old Imperial Palace - Very spacious rooms. Good amount of floor space to lay everything out, huge bathroom and showers. Our room came with a 42"" TV, which we didn't use too much but it was nice to have. The beds are pretty typical, but who really cares when you're passed out from a long night of partying? Cons: - The room was a bit outdated. I understand that they're upgrading their rooms, so I guess most rooms will eventually look a lot newer. Not an inconvenience, just something that could be improved. - No free-wifi in the rooms. Not sure if any hotel in Vegas has free wi-fi, but it would've been nice. Overall, a pretty good experience. We weren't looking for anything too fancy and wanted to keep the price low. We got what we paid for and left happy. Thanks Excalibur! ",0,0,0,1,0

I bought a top of the line computer for my daughter who goes to UNR and after 6 weeks it stopped working. The geeks squad cannot fix a laptop since they don't have a ""clean room"" they have to send it out for repairs. it will take 3 weeks!!!!! So now I have to buy a new computer because best buy won't stand behind their products and just return it and give her a new one. I don't know about you but I would expect more than 6 weeks of use.

 My wife and I used to eat here every Sunday until we got busy doing other things. After about 3 months away, we ate Sunday lunch buffet today. As usual, the buffet was fresh and delicious. The choices were extensive. Now the down side. The restaurant was not quite full and even though we had a waiter that has been there for years, the service was a little slow. Also, the bread served was not the rolls that they had served for years. Instead of an artisan style hard crust roll, these were almost like brown-n-serve rolls. They were not even warm. Definitely out of character for this restaurant. Even the co-owner brother was not the happy person that was enjoyed by many in months and years past. Something was wrong. I hope they bounce back soon. We will be back. ",0,0,0,1,0
