 Still the place I consider for comparing to other fine dining restaurants. Food here is more than just a meal, it's more of an experience. Service here is tremendous. Decor is extremely nice(think Museum) along with the view of the water fountains(if you are so lucky). Go with the Prix-Fixe Menu and be prepared for the best 2-3 hours of your life. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I really wanted to give this group a better rating... My husband and I work in construction and know how to measure. Since we weren't closing on our home for another 2 weeks, we took our own measurements on a floor plan and went to NuLook to get a rough estimate for laying down some laminate and base. They guys were very friendly and knowledgable and we were pretty set on just using them for the job. We ended up passing another flooring store down the road and figured lets get a 2nd quote and see if they have different products. We got our 2nd quote, went home and discussed our options. Come the day after we close on our home my husband goes back to NuLook to see if we could get someone to come officially measure right away. They wouldn't have anyone for another 4 days and they would call us to set up a time. 6 days later, we heard nothing. We called but there was no answer. Poor customer service in my opinion. We took our business to the 2nd place and we are extremely happy with the outcome! Sorry NuLook, in this economy, you would think you would follow up on a job... ",0,1,0,0,0

 July 5th, 2013 was when my wedding was held outside at Mandalay Bay. It took me less than 5 months to plan and save for the wedding. It was everything I could have asked for my wedding coordinator was prompt in answering my questions through email and there was barely any details that we didn't even go over. I live in Indiana, so for me to not be present in physical form was pretty iffy. But my sister lives out in the area so it was easy for me to reference from her and trust her judgment. I changed my venue last minute, so to plan a wedding in less than 5 months was kind of crazy. The decorations, flowers, and colors just all came together so perfectly. The photographer did a super job. Of course, they have to had done 100's of weddings so their skill should just be flawless. I loved every moment of it and being stress free of having to actually physically decorate. Destination weddings are the way to go. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Even if you are inexplicably dying of hunger or thirst, do NOT come here. Your waitress, who'll likely be a former stripper from Reno past her prime, will toss down your menus and expect you to order immediately. IMMEDIATELY. And when you're not looking, she'll throw away your takeout from Secret Pizza that you've carefully placed on the seat next to you. Oh, and if you complain to the management, you get a.....free shrug!!! A. SHRUG. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I just have to say my experience at this restaurant was horrible tonight. The waitress was not very attentive at all. We had to ask another wait staff for refills on our drinks. She seemed to be more focused on other tables than ours. I mentioned our bad experience to the manager and he gave me a half hearted apology..That being said, the food was awesome, the service horrible.the only positive thing about tonight is that I got a $25 gift card.

 Best Christmas tree selection and the guys helping are so helpful and nice. They give a fresh cut and assist to the vehicle. Janis, the owner is really sweet and supports the community charities. Thanks! ",0,0,0,1,0

 The food was fresh and the service was quick. My small salad was large and fresh. The ciabatta sandwich was also fresh and tasty. I will be back. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This used to be a 5 star from me as the food is usually very good and completely vegan with gluten free options that are cooked to order, not the typical gluten free default breads and tortillas that other places use. The reason for this review though, is that the place has really been off their game lately. This is so sad because I want to love them and I keep giving chances almost weekly! All summer I have been going there, but more than 75% of the time they are closed during hours that their website and yelp state should be opened. This is beyond frustrating as they are across town for me and also I have tried to bring a few different friends from out of town only to get there and have to find another place. usually when I get to eat there, the food is phenomenal; however, I have noticed portions getting smaller and smaller and when the owner is not there they always ""run out"" of gluten free bread (which is made to order so read: don't feel like mainf it). Finally, I went yet again today to order my favorite thing, the ""BLT gluten free"", which I have ordered for four years now, and it was literally about a quarter of the size that it used to be. I could have eaten it in 3 bites and it was $12.50!! I never usually complain but I did ask if I could either get more or be charged for a half order, since that is what I got. They were nice and gave me another micro mini sandwich but they both were completely undressed and very different from the usual deliciousness. They were mediocre at best. I'm really disappointed and after 4 months of really unfortunate disappointments, not sure I want to keep giving chances to this place... Ugh there goes one of the few vegan options I have... Really hope they get it together Bc I miss 24 carrots! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Went there for a lunch date with a friend, food was lacking is the flavor department and it was all cold. Then, while we were eating, the music started skipping like it was on a scratched CD... Wtf . The service was okay, nothing to write home about, probably won't be back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Great value for consistently good food. I keep getting the pulled pork sandwich. Need to try something else. They also have a wide range of sides, many of which are home made and done well. The place runs like a clock. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Any savy smart travel girls' new hot spot! I stopped into Vegas' XpresSpa on my way to catching a flight back home to MN. Excellent customer service and speedy service. This is my new favorite spot while on the go! Professional, fun and stress reliever! I cannot wait to go back! Props to you guys - job well done! ",0,0,0,0,1

 People rave about Voodoo donut in Portland, now Vegas has something to rave about! I actually think that Pink Box is better than Voodoo. Voodoo takes good donuts and puts interesting toppings on them, Pink Box takes good donuts and puts interesting things on and IN them! I am fortunate enough to live right down the street so I've tried quite a few things. I also routinely pick up a dozen on my way to work, just give me a reason to bring them in! Here are a few of my favorites: Fritters! They have apple and cherry! The cherry are SO good, but I've only seen them a couple of times. Key Lime Pie - This delicious morsel has homemade whipped cream on top and is filled with the limiest of lime fillings. SO good! Lemon filled - This glazed beauty has lemony goodness stuffed inside. If you are a fan of lemon, this is the donut for you. S'mores - Brulee'd marshmallow cream is on top of this chocolate covered marshmallow cream filled little cloud. Cheesecake - Chocolate covered and filled with delicious cream cheese cheesecake filling. Now, get out of your house and go...seriously GO...I'll wait... You can thank me later! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Don't waste your time or money! Luckily I like 80's music so I could sing along and keep entertained. Is a cheesy stage show with girls dancing who look like they would have more fun sitting and plucking out every hair on their body. I got dressed and ready for this? Where is my rifle? Here's what you do!!!!!!! Rent a Vampire movie...sit on the couch naked! So much more fun! I like boobies...where are they? Boyscouts in bikini's I swear. What is the point in a topless show? I saw more at Chippendales than this show. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Nice hotel. Good rate, via online weekend deals. Great free breakfast. Bed was comfy. No complaints about room or service. Upgrade over other budget places. Would stay again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Rica and I went to Phipps because the Museum of Natural History was shut, but we'd already paid for parking. The plant exhibits are pretty and informative. The decor was festive. You can see the whole place by only making right turns. I liked the orchids and the snowmen-made-of-pine-branches wedding display. The bonsai display was partially blocked. The men's bathroom was clean, with large dividers between the urinals. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Had the pastrami chili fries, the fries tasted like they were old and very hard, not fresh at all, the pastrami and pickles were good but they totally skimp on those ingredients and the price was way too high for what you get 10$ for the fries and the coke, the guy behind the counter was nice, 15 minutes later instant diarrhea. Not sure if would try a burger next time, not sure if I would eat there again ",1,0,0,0,0

 If you've eaten at Pizzeria Bianco, you already have an understanding of how much care and attention the folks at Pane Bianco will give to your sandwich. Today's market sandwich was filled with textured goat cheese, roasted tomatoes, and arugula -- delicious. Each sandwich comes with a small piece of candy for dessert (which, if you're like me, you'll eat on the way out the door). While the sandwiches are great, here's the beauty of Pane Bianco -- you can purchase loaves of the house bread served at Pizzeria Bianco for $3 each. I've never had better bread than this. Period. I'll be picking up a loaf the next time I make Nigella's trout pate (http://www.notquitenigella.com/2008/01/22/smoked-trout-pate-from-nigella-express/). ",0,0,0,1,0
