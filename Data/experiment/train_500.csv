 Last night I went to west side Grimaldi's for the first time. I've been a fan of their pizza ever since it was introduced to me at work when we were filming TV shows near the eastside location. I had been meaning to come by and show my support for the ""new"" Grimaldi's by my house for awhile. We dined on the patio, and it was perfect weather to do so. Yes, it's that one week in Vegas between hot summers and cold winters. The service left something to be desired, and I was bummed that there weren't any appetizers on the menu like garlic knots (I swear there used to be, no?) -- but those are my only real complaints. The pizza was great, and the ingredients were fresh as always. I'm sure there was a price for the pizza, but I got lucky in that I won some Internet contest and received a $100 Grimaldi's gift card in the mail a month or so ago, so the only money that left my pocket was for a tip.

 This gym is the filthiest, smelliest gym I have ever been in, the staff never cleans ANYTHING! We joined as a couple the price was right but we found out the hard way why! The Owner is extremely rude and seems to have a Napoleon complex or was having a roid rage moment! We were over charged on our credit card by only 7.00 but the amount wasn't the issue it was never corrected.. When we brought this to his attention he freaked out and cancelled our memberships! This blew our minds. His mistake, his gym who else do you go to? Well, not this guy, he seems really bothered by dealing with customer service a word he apparently never learned, his people aren't trained either which isn't any surprise! Don't waste your money you might end up sick, if this place doesn't clean up it's act they will most definitely be shut down! The health dept is on there way hopefully, I know several unhappy members who have reported these pigs!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Had the most basic drink: a small coffee. But it was very tasty. I think it was Illy. However, I think that little cup of coffee was over $3. But it is the Cosmo, so I'm not sure if you can find a cheaper coffee. I think the lattes were over $5! and I don't think it comes with a gold leaf or anything. There wasn't too much of a line so it was very quick, but when we left a huge group of people were in line, and depending on what they order, I have no idea how long it could take (e.g., gelato, sandwiches, snacks, etc). Takes credit cards, so that was convenient. If you're looking for a coffee, it's really not a bad option, just be prepared to pay for it, as if the coffee were made of gold. ",0,0,0,1,0

 India Palace is an excellent alternative to nearby buffets on the Strip... and (generally speaking) far less expensive! For about $12, you get a solid variety of popular Indian dishes (Chicken Tikka, Tandoori, Veggie Korma, Dosas, Basmati, Naan, Salad, and Desserts... to name a few), which all taste pretty good. I have had Indian food all over the world, so that's a definite compliment from me. Although the place was pretty clean and had decent decor, the service leaves some room for improvement. The location is also a bit seedy, but understandable as it is on the outskirts of the Strip. I also gagged when I discovered something that resembled a cockroach leg in my Masala. After inspection, I'd like to give India Palace the benefit of the doubt even though I've never seen such a thing in the countless Masala dishes I've had; but nevertheless, it totally ruined my appetite... but not enough to not give India Palace a second chance. The lack of service and room for improvement on the curries (I have had better- Saagar in Newport Beach is a comparable place and is much better) led me to give 4 out of 5 stars. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Mmmmm. Yummy. First let me say that the unassuming facade says nothing about the little gem inside. Since the place just opened, there's a banner instead of a sign, and a small curb tent directing diners in to the -only- open store in the building. But for those who brave new frontiers, it's worth it. Z's House Sandwich = Gooood. The smoked pork brings out the sausage and bacon lover in me, and yet I was rewarded with an equally good helping of 'Fresh' as well - the cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers were all great! The Egg Salad sandwich also received high marks from my compatriot, and I loved the option of the Orangina for drinks! Which leads me to the second aspect of the place - while it has little for decoration (other than the very comely proprietor) it has a wonderful supply of European goods - chocolates, breads, biscuits, drinks, meats and yes, Eurocrem. A vanilla and hazelnut spread that competes with Nutella in my book! Ahhh, yes. I hope others find and patronize this place enough to keep it in business, so I can continue to visit my happy euro-place! Update: I'm happy to report that business seems to have picked up as there was a short line for lunch! It didn't take long to get served, and they also offer lunch deals that are well worth the visit! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I had one of the most satisfying all around meals I've ever had at this restaurant and I cannot wait to go back. I went for Pittsburgh Restaurant Week and ordered the fixed three course meal and every dish was not only something i had never tried before but was also delicious. The best part of the meal was a goat cheese and balsamic ice cream which i was nervous to try but was actually mind blowing. As it was Restaurant Week the place which is fairly small was very packed but the staff was incredibly social and very helpful in describing all of the food and wine pairings. On top of all of this I got 3 orders and three drink pairings for $30 which was incredible. I cannot speak highly enough of my all around experience here. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Excellent little place in the heart of downtown Kitchener! Although service can be a bit slow, the food is absolutely worth the wait. After ordering, miso soup and salad were served. The salad was very fresh and very different. It wasn't the usual Thousand Island sauce or vinaigrette sauce. It was very tangy, with a slight wasabi flavour to it. I found the miso soup to be lacking in flavour. My friend and I shared two rolls - Love Love and Grand Canyon. The chef definitely had his creative hat on when crafting these rolls. The Love Love roll (spicy tuna, salmon, masago) was very unique. The Grand Canyon roll (eel, cooked salmon, cream cheese, tempura bits) was absolutely epic. The roll was baked just before serving. The tempura bits were very crunchy and it had such a different texture! ",0,0,0,1,0

 So, here is what I propose you do. First, the breakfast burrito with ham, cheese and potato. Then Lunch - the giant burro with chicken, a fresh lemonade and tres leche cake. Go into a food coma for 3 days, repeat... No you will not live long, you will not be productive and eventually you will outgrow your pants, your bed, your house but you will die happy and really that is what is all about...so, I repeat, the breakfast burrito...go for it! El Sol is found in some dumpy strip mall on Arizona Ave next to a trophy shop and a defunct piano tuner betw/Chandler Blvd and Ray. Parking is maybe the 3 spots in front. It is the perfect lunch spot when you want to take the afternoon off and sleep, the perfect breakfast when you want to eat and nap directly afterwards. It is not heavy food, it is not greasy food, but whatever turkey dinner has in it, it has got it in spades! It is that full, I really should take some time to enjoy this meal type of feeling. Enjoy.

 The novelty of eating during your movie quickly wears out due to the horrific customer service. I'm not sure if it's adequately staffed or what but after finally taking my order 40 minutes into the film, it took them another 50 minutes to bring me my food: a simple order of buffalo wings! If you're going to the movies here and need to eat out, hit something in town first or the 347 Grill (if popcorn or icecream won't do the trick, that is). ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is a pretty cool little pizza place to come have a beer and watch a game in the bar room on one of their many flat screen TVs. They have a good happy hour 3-7. Their pizza is ok. The boneless wings are pretty bad. Nothing you would find at a Buffalo Wild Wings. The rest of the food is pretty good tho ",0,0,0,1,0

 The Fruitmarket is conveniently located just next to the train station which means that if you have some time to kill and fancy a coffee and/or a bite to eat, you don't need to settle for expensive and sub-par station food. Our coffees were lovely, but our cakes left a bit to be desired as The Man's carrot cake was quite dry and my orange and almond cake was swimming in frosting/sugar drizzle and tasted nothing of almonds. Staff were a bit funny about two people having to sit on a table for two (rather than a larger one), which I could get if it was at all busy and if we didn't have a million bags between us, but there was only one table other than us and we ended up crammed in a corner with our bags spilling into the walkway. Totally fine for a pre-train coffee, but not somewhere I would come otherwise. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We showed up at 5:30 without reservations. There were only two tables seated in the restaurant, and we were told that they were full with a lot of snobbery and little concern for our opinion of their establishment. We were very excited to try the place, and the experience was completely wrecked by the very unwelcoming attitude. The food looked good, but the attitude was definitely not. Regardless of when everyone else shows up, you can at least let someone sit at the bar for an hour dinner when they're is only two other tables seated in the whole place. We definitely would have been gone by the time the last reservation arrived. I can't really truly convey how disappointing and almost downright humiliating it is to be told the restaurant is booked when there are 8 people sitting in the entire place and 20+ empty tables. While I understand opentable and the reservation system (and often use it myself), there is something to be said for being a human being and making a little effort. Perhaps a nicer explanation and an offer of a drink and an appetizer at the bar. I'm a little disappointed in myself for not making even a little bit of a scene, or being as rude to the hostess as she was to us. I'm not normally that way, and rarely consider doing so in a restaurant (especially where I'm planning to eat), but I was downright PISSED at the haughty ""we don't give a sh*t"" about your patronage attitude as we walked down the street. We ended up going a few blocks away to Chez L'epiecier http://www.yelp.ca/biz/chez-lepicier-restaurant-bar-a-vin-montreal for one of the best meals of my life. Save yourself some frustration, and just go there instead if you don't mind spending a few dollars more. I'm sure the food is probably good if you don't mind the potential of being treated like just another diner. I've had better service at McDonalds. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Moira has grown on me. They aren't my favorite sushi in the the Valley, but they certainly try to be! Their location is much welcome in the Downtown Phx area. Now, I am a sushi snob, so I don't think they have the freshest cuts or the most creative menu. I do think that if you're downtown and craving sushi, (especially late night) they get the job done. If you want a really good bargain, hit their happy hour and reverse happy hour. You can eat a ton of sushi on the cheap and go home satisfied. If you're there for happy hour, try the White Blossom and the Vegas. Both rolls are not very ""authentic"" or ""traditional"" but both are very tasty. Off of their regular menu, I suggest you try their hamachi yellowtail sashimi with a side of Sriracha, the Sunshine roll and the Spicy Hana roll are both good choices too. Moira offers many exotic mixed drinks to tempt your palate into trying something new, but be careful of the prices. The drinks can run anywhere from $7 -$10 and add up quickly. If you're downtown and don't feel like driving far or detouring from the light rail, go to Moira for your sushi fix. They have some solid choices for your sushi craving. ",0,0,1,0,0

 After getting mediocre haircuts at places like Fantastic Sam's and Supercuts, I was in search of a professional salon.

 My boyfriend and I visited Lollicup for the first time during the middle of the day in 115 degree weather. We were near heat exhaustion and needing a drink. We both got a bottle of water, which we instantly downed and a watermelon smoothie- the one made with real fruit. OMG- The watermelon smoothie was the most amazing, perfect thing on a ridiculously hot day. I can't remember the last time something tasted so good or so refreshing. It just hit the spot. Service was a little slow at Lollicup. We had one couple in front of us, but waited about ten minutes. It felt more intense because we were so hot! I would definitely go here again and will seek out the chain in my local area. Loved it! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Maybe I hit this place on a bad day. My wife and I stopped in here on a whim for a snack. We split a waffle with whipped cream and strawberries. The waffle was pretty good -- if a bit too sweet for our tastes -- but the tiny little shop was uncomfortable and the service less than cordial. The ""tables"" are thin wooden boards nailed to the wall and it was hard for us to sit and relax on the high rickety stools. I was also put off by the attitude of the young woman behind the counter. There were no other customers when we arrived and she was too busy with something on her smartphone to pay much attention to us. With almost a sigh of annoyance she took our order and prepared the waffle, then went back to her phone before we could even get the sticky, dripping plate of waffle and melting whipped cream back to the ""table"" (only three steps away). For a $5 waffle, I expect friendlier service, and a more comfortable atmosphere. Needless to say, I don't think I'll be going back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Way over rated restaurant. We had dinner here Sunday on the patio. The service started out pretty good until I asked for a sample of one of the two beers they had on tap. The $2 charge was not worth the sample. Bottle beer selection was better than most but still pretty weak. We had a beet salad that was pretty good, a caprese panino that was bland, a baked penne that was equally bland and slightly overcooked, and Margherita Neapolitan pizza that was soggy. Over priced and over rated. If you must try this place then hit it for lunch when at least the prices aren't too bad. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've eaten here twice now. I will continue to do so, as a group goes here Sunday evenings, and I enjoy the night out. But I'd prefer eating elsewhere. For starters, the burgers. I know people who rave about Red Robin burgers...nothing I've had here would set me to raving. The burgers are restaurant burgers; a bit better than McDonald's or similar, but nowhere near what I can do at home, and more costly. Nothing here sets it apart from any other mediocre restaurant style burger place. Of the two times I've eaten here, I once had the burger come pink -extremely- pink (like, 'rare'; I asked for medium. I think it was just rushed out of the kitchen because I ordered later than the rest of my party. If you don't like that, explicitly state 'no pink'), and the other time, there was a misunderstanding what I wanted (I asked for the Royal Red Robin burger, the waitress said ""You mean the cheeseburger?"" I didn't have the menu any more, and didn't remember if it had cheese on it or not, so said ""Uh...I guess?"" Apparently not), which wasn't exactly the restaurants fault, but was still really weird and kinda made it less appealing. That said, neither burger was worth the ~$10 I shelled out for it. I'm just...not enthused. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Not to bad.. not to bad at all.. you know me and chain restaurants don't get along very well.

Crunch toasted bread.. smokey bacon and turkey.. guacamole and tomatoes.. what else could top this off, a slice of pepper jack cheese. It didn't fucking suck! Now the free ice cream, that sucked!

 Lobster Me was just OK for us. I still think the lobster roll in Ogunquit, Maine is still the best and the freshest-tasting.

Note: The lobster bisque takes a while to prepare as it's soup in a bread bowl. I'm not sure why it was taking so long. Then, they forgot the Cajun Fries. Note: You cannot charge the restaurant meal to your room at the Palazzo / Venetian. That's too bad! Another Note: Go early for your meals 'cos they only have a few tables and chairs at their little restaurant space in the Grand Canal Shoppes. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Muscle Maker Grill....Their motto ""Great Food with Your Health in Mind"". So, let's see what's really going on. I had a co-worker rave about this place years ago and at the time; they were just based on the East Coast. Well, now they're here and I was curious if my bud knew what he was talking about. Their menu consists of wraps, soups, salads, burgers, sandwiches, pastas, protein shakes, and smoothies. Also on their menu are the total calories for each dish. I had two meals. Meal #1: Premium Burger, Baked Potato, and an extra Chicken Breast. There was nothing really special about the baked potato. It was on the small side. I thought that the burger was as juicy and as tasty as it gets for a 90% lean burger. The highlight was the chicken breast. I eat a lot of chicken throughout the week. In my opinion, Muscle Maker's was one of the best clean chicken breast that I've had in a while. The meat was thick, plump, and grilled just right. Meal #2: Rocky Balboa Wrap. I only got this because one of the regulars and the employees suggested it. I'm glad they did. This wrap had chicken breast, turkey meatballs, cheese, and marinara. This isn't the cleanest meal on their menu, but perfect if you're trying to up your calories and at the same time get your protein in. Taste wise, this was pretty good. The restaurant is clean and they should be since they're new. The staff is great and there are a lot of them. This Muscle Maker is located near the 24 Hour Fitness, which drove a lot of post-work out diners here. So, it can get busy. Overall, I'm a fan will come back. I have an office just 5 minutes from here and when it's time to pound some protein, it's nice to know that there's a place minutes from me. TIP: -They deliver ($2.50 charge) -Recommended by HealthyDiningFinder.com -Prices are average ",0,0,0,1,0

 Way over priced. The deal here is to fill you up on overloaded French Fry's. The bill for 2 burgers, 2 Frys, and 2 drinks was $28.00. Even eating in, they must treat it like take out because our order came in a brown bag. So we had no tray, basket, or plates. They put the burgers in the bottom of the bag and filled 6"" of French frys on top of it. Way more than any one person would want to eat. Each order of frys looked like the equivalent of 2 whole potatoes. The only good thing I could say was the burger by itself was very good. It was cooked just right. Juicy and flavorful. Still, the price can't be overlooked. $28.00 for 2 people is too much for a lunch of fast food ",0,1,0,0,0

 Earnhardt's Chrysler Jeep robbed me of my innocence. I went to Earnhardt's to test drive a Wrangler, and thus begins my first encounter with the demon seed known as Earnhardt's Sale's Staff. I was looking around the lot, and checking out different versions and years of the Wrangler when a somewhat smarmy but otherwise friendly salesman asked me if I was interested in a Jeep. I told him, that I was, but not interested in buying anything, just a test drive. He said that was cool, and asked me which one so I could drive it. I picked a white Sahara. He grabbed the keys from the front desk, got a copy of my ID and off we went. It was nice, but when he shot me a price of over 30K for the thing, I balked and said not a chance. So we went back to the lot and he suggested he take me to the back lot and look over all of the Wranglers they had to find one within my price range. At this point I didn't know jack squat about how much one should cost because I didn't expect to buy anything, but I played along. We finally found one that he told me was in my price range (I didn't tell him how much I wanted to spend, so how did he figure that out on his own?) and so had me test drive that one instead. It was nowhere near as nice as the Sahara, but the sticker said 23K so it wasn't as much of a shock to the system as the 30K+ was. Even still, I wasn't really interested at that price. Undaunted in his quest for a commission, he asked me if I had a trade. I said uh... yeah. His eyes lit up like a kid on Chrismas morning. ""Well, we could easily get the payments as low as you want them with a trade! Let's go run some numbers."" I replied,""Um... no I'm cool. I'll just take my car home"". Then he whipped out the phrase that ensnares hapless first time car buyers across the country into their web of high-pressure sales: ""What could we do to get you into this car Today?"" I said ""A payment below $200"". Now anyone who wasn't as naive as myself at the time, would know that no matter what the salesman says at this point, there's no way you can finance 23,000 for $200 a month without rolling it into a 15 year mortgage. Regardless, he assures me that that is possible. :| To make a long story short (too late I know) after 8 hours in a torture chamber filled with ""sales managers"" ""closers"" and ""finance guys"", I drove off in my bone stock Wrangler SE at a payment of $383 and a really bad headache. They told me I had gotten a GREAT deal, so they must be telling the truth right? Much like a bad one-night stand, everything looks much different the next day with the lights on. Too bad it took me a year to really scrutinze the deal they gave me. They sold me a Jeep that was listed at $17,995 for $17,995 with $5,000 of what was labeled ""Additional Dealer Markup"" in tiny little print at the bottom. However, since I never looked at the sticker myself until long after the sale, I didn't see it. My dealings with their service department have been equally lackluster and I have warded all of my friends, family, enemies, religious leaders, professors, random strangers, and pets to stay away from Earnhardt's. The only good thing I can say about Earnhardt's is that they have a huge stock. If you must visit them, find the model you want in their inventory, take a test drive, and then go to another dealer and get that car from them. No Bull? Yeah... except for the $5000 worth of bull on the sticker price. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. However the service was a little disappointing.

 I'm going to a concert in a few days and I wanted a haircut before then. This was very last minute and the place I usually go to was completely booked. I called to see if this place had any openings and they got me a spot within just 30 minutes. Not to mention, they were very patient with me on the phone as I had to put them on hold several times. Erin was very patient and fixed my hair up even though I probably asked her to do something more to it at least five times. I have never been satisfied with a haircut before but finally this time finally did the trick. I loved my haircut. The price was a little more on the high end but it was well worth it for what I got and it looked very similar to the hairstyle in the picture. I would definitely love to go here from now on.

 First off the bat there. the lady that took our order was not really paying attention to our orders. Hence is why im eating burgers with my friend right now that we did not order and got it wrong. My friend ordered a modernest. But she got a way different burger with jalapenos in it. Way to spicy for her and for her one year old daughter. I ordered the midevil burger with the biggest size of patty. Yet i got a burger the size of a mcdonalds happy meal burger. The fries where limp and soggy. The only positive part of this meal was the sweet potato fries. Also word of advice for the workers there, pay attention to your customers orders and pull up your pants. If i wanted to go see some thong and ass id go to a strip club. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Excellent studio! I generally only take the time to write reviews if I am OVERLY pleased or OVERLY disappointed and this is certainly an overly pleased situation. I have been going to Floo-id off an on for a few months. I wanted to try hot yoga for the longest time but really was too afraid. I didn't want to feel stupid or embarrassed if I couldn't do something. From the moment I walked in on a saturday morning, the instructor at the front, Jen, reassured me of what to expect and what to do if I feel like I cant do something. SCORE! From what I have heard, a lot of yoga studios in the valley can be somewhat pretentious and this place, is the complete opposite. I always feel amazing when I leave. I don't feel like anyone is looking at me weird or even looking at me at all. Great studio, Great instructors, Great atmosphere. Thank you Floo-id. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was actually looking for another restaurant that no longer existed apparently so stopped in here on a whim because I was so hungry. I have the broasted chicken sandwich with an arugula salad and I have to say it was probably the best sandwich I have ever had. The bread was fresh and warm, the cheese on the sandwich was yum and hte sauce was not over powering. Would go back again if I lived here. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ya know, it's really tough to enjoy a meal when your experience with the hostess rubs you the wrong way right when you walk in the door. We met some good friends there this past Thursday, and were there to use our groupon. They have a two year old - which normally isn't even worth mentioning, but that's where it went horribly wrong with the hostess. For some reason, she looked down on us - and not just because she's taller. Basically she said they had a table in the back where we wouldn't bother anyone with the ""child"". I realize that restaurants such as these are normally quieter, more intimate, less rowdy, so it's not what she suggested, it's how she said it. Our friend's child happens to be very well behaved, but she assumed we would be a distraction or a nuisance. The fact that she was a ginger, while not affecting her poor courtesy, is still worth mentioning. The server was attentive, for the most part, with the exception of drink refills. I can't comment on the quality of the steak, because everyone I was with who ordered steak ordered it wrong (medium well / well done). The food, for the most part, was forgettable, and unfortunately, we will not be back. Luckily it was a cheap night thanks to groupon!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 3 stars sounds just about right for this place. If I was rating it just on the quality of the room, 3.5 or 4 might sound right, but there are too many problems with the service (moreso the hotel's policies than the people). I stayed 3 nights in a room in the Carnaval Tower. For the price (averaged about $40/night for 3 weeknights), the room was quite good. It was spacious, clean, and had a nice bathroom. Let's get to the negatives. For one, I had to pay $28 to check in early on a Tuesday. I'm sorry, but that's bullshit. I understand how things work in Vegas, and that most properties that don't charge a resort fee do charge for early check-in, but I seriously dislike paying such a fee. Fortunately for Harrah's, I also dislike waiting in line, so I paid the money in order to drop my bag off in my room, and begrudginly paid the fee. I also think the casino here straight up sucks. The machines were too tight, and for a low-roller casino, the table minimums seemed kind of high to me. $10 was the lowest minimum I found for roulette, and all of the $10 blackjack games pay 6:5 for a blackjack, which is deplorable, in my opinion. That's really not even blackjack. I didn't eat at any of the restaurants while I stayed here, because they looked unimpressive. I could go on and on about how this place bleeds every last dollar out of its customers ($4.50 for a regular coffee from Starbucks?!), but that's how Vegas works these days. It would be unfair to criticize this hotel for something every other hotel in town does. At the same time, it would be nice to find a place on the strip that really does cater to the budget-minded gambler like Harrah's and Imperial Palace claim to. I've heard things are still like that downtown, but I'm not looking to be sitting at a table with a bunch of 70 year olds, so I'm not too anxious to find out. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have been a patient at the Joint at Norterra, but the DR. there suddenly, and mysteriously disappeared. I hesitantly went to the Camelback location, because the Dr. that treated me at Norterra was the only Dr. that could adjust me well in many many years of getting Chiropractic care. To my complete surprise, Dr. Stuart, treated me and was able to get all my adjustments the first time, which is very difficult to do with my spinal history. I will continue as his patient as long as he will have me, and appreciate his dedication and expertise very much. Thank You Dr. Stuart.

 I joined this gym in January with my fianc \ u00e9. It was crowded but everyone expects that when you join a gym in January! It was a great experience then. The cardio cinema is really great. I wanted to do my review after about 5 months to get the full picture. Well the place is now so overcrowded with people just standing around and the people there are what people warn you about with North Las Vegas. Not comfortable at all coming except to go to a class and leave. I would not go there just to work alone any more. Also, there really needs to be a timer for the movies because on more than one occasion I had to actually call the front desk to ask for someone to come and restart the movie!!

 I wouldn't consider this gourmet, but then again when I went to Hue in Vietnam I didn't have any gourmet style food. Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. I can appreciate the authenticity of their food here. Though I can't say I'm a big fan. The taste just doesn't hit me with enough bang! The food was okay, but I must give them props for service. I enjoy trying to speak Vietnamese and the server trying to teach and encourage me to speak...haha. Yes, I'm still learning .....

 Sure, you could go to one of the steakhouses on the Strip that have been decorated to look like an old-school steakhouse... but for the same money, why not GO to an old-school steakhouse? The Golden Steer looks like a total dive on the outside, but inside it's the room that time forgot. Everything looks exactly like it would have back when the Rat Pack was said to be among the Steer's clientele. Service is equally old-school - your glasses will never be empty and every crumb quickly swept. The menu is equally traditional - steaks, creamed spinach, etc. It's cooked to order and tasty. We've gone here to celebrate signing big deals, but we've also just gone to get a great steak. It's worth the cab ride. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Like Shauna, I am also surprised at the other reviews. I have visited PJ's several times, and have never had a bad experience. The food has ALWAYS been spot on and the wait staff has been incredible each time. My personal favorite is the fish and chips, which has always had a great flavor, and a wonderful breading on them, that definately does not dissapoint. The price seems a little bit steep until you see how much fish you get! It definately has plenty of food on the plate for you. The atmosphere has always been clean, and with the live music that they have, its hard to turn the place down. If your looking for someplace to sit and enjoy, this could very well be the place for you! ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place seriously used to be amazing. I haven't been back here in about 5 years or so, and thought id give it a shot since I didn't want to drive all the way to Khourys. (I'll never be lazy again I swear!) I ordered a chicken dish that was the worst tasting meal of my life. Not one thing tasted good. The chicken was rubbery and so seasoned to the point of being repulsive. Flavorless rice and bland soup. Clearly under new ownership and no continuity. I wish I would have checked the reviews before. $20 later for just lunch for myself ( no alcohol) and I have major food regret. I'm sorry for the harsh review. ",1,0,0,0,0

 First of all, my 5* rating is because of the food, not the atmosphere. The food is delicious! I love Joe's bbq sauce, it is perfect, sooo much better than many other places. All of the side items are yummy and fit in to the comfort-food category. I still have not tried any of the desserts, but they all look delicious....cakes, brownies, and huge old-fashioned root beer floats. The employees are all very nice. As far as the actual restaurant itself, it is very help-yourself, no-frills set-up. If the place is busy, which it usually is because the food is so good :) , you have to stand in a long line. Eventually, you reach the cafeteria style area, where you grab a tray, utensils, napkins, etc. I would not want to be eating at any of the tables or booths by the line with people standing there, watching me chow down. Once your order is taken at the next counter, you wait for your food, pay for it, and then find a place to sit. There is a big outdoor seating area which is nice if you have kids. I just wish they served a nice cold beer here, but they do not. Guess that would ruin the family type atmosphere. Fortunately, Postino's and Oregano's is right across the street if you decide you do want to have a before or after dinner drink. You can also order-to-go outside the building, this is definitely a plus. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Although my kids seem to love it here, this place is always a hit or miss. The service is never consistent. We went in today for lunch around 2pm. It was my daughter's choice for her birthday and she invited a few friends. It didn't seem too busy as we were seated quickly with no wait. There was 10 of us, 4 adults and 6 kids. After getting our drink orders it took a while for the server to come back to get our meal order. I've noticed this a few times before when it didn't look busy. They only have one or two servers working the dining area but at the same time they seem to be overworked because they're under staffed. The food was great however, we always get our fill of chips, beans, and salsa while we wait for our meal. I ordered the steak Mexicana which was delicious and cooked perfectly. Again, the server came by once to ask how everything was and if we needed refills. By the time we were done, we had to give obvious signs we were ready for our check (hubby left with the kiddies to get situated in the car, turn on AC). The server came about 5 minutes later. Our bill wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be which made me feel a little better. The food is good and priced right to fit my family's budget. Despite the lack of service, we will always come back. Hopefully they will work on getting it better. ",0,0,1,0,0

Not your everyday buttermilk Bisquick pancakes, but pancakes the BabyStacks way.

 It takes a lot for me to write a negative review, but I am simply baffled by all of the positive reviews this place has received. My girlfriend and I ate here for dinner and expected the food to be edible at the very least. This was not simply a matter of it being an ""off night"" - it was clear from the start that the quality of ingredients was well below what one would expect from a low grade cafeteria. The ""house balsamic"" served over iceberg was watery and flavorless. The bread tasted like cardboard. Her Penne Arrabiata was coated in a less than generous portion of bland sauce and the pasta was overcooked. My eggplant parmesan sandwich (The Favorito) was not only foul tasting, but down right bizarre - like eating the fried skin of some weird alien, not even distantly reminiscent of what i know as eggplant, served on the same crappy bread. Somehow our waitress could not comprehend that we did not want boxes. We left with full plates, empty pockets and emptier stomaches. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This was my first dinning experience at this restaurant and I'm sorry to report that chances are slim to none that I will ever return. The service was average at best, wait time was much slower than it should be. The champagne arrived warm and it took over 20 minutes for it to get to an acceptable chill. I had to ask the waiter to please bring more ice since when we complained that it was warm and they didn't respond. We shared the foie gras and it was extremely small for $20 and the toast served with it was so heavily drenched in butter it overpowered the taste. We had to ask for plain bread instead. We then had the salmon entree and a side order of the mac n cheese. Very nice flavor and we left feeling satisfied. However, around 5 hours later, we both started experiencing stomach cramps and diarrhea. This went on all night long. I wasn't happy about spending $180 for dinner and getting sick, so the next morning I called to tell management our experience. I wasn't sure what to, but I thought they should know. She spoke to me very courteously, but basically said, ' they checked all their food for expiration, and no one else complained"". This reaction annoyed me. I feel at the very least an apology was in order and perhaps offer of something on our next visit, anything! This is very poor customer service and I will not return there again. There are too many places for fine dinning here, i don't have to patronize an establishment that is not concerned about my comfort or satisfaction. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The short version: Not bad, not great. A few problems, nothing major. The food was good... not great, but good. The long version: A friend and I met up here for lunch yesterday. Even though it was noon, the service was quick. Unfortunately, the floor was had been mopped with something that left a slick residue, and my friend (who was wearing flip flops) had to quickly find a seat so as not to fall. I, however, was wearing boots with heavy tread, so I had no problem. Our food arrived about 10 minutes after we sat down, and it was fresh and enjoyable, though it didn't stand out from other burgers I've had at places like 5 Guys. (I had the Paradise Valley Cheese Burger). The table was wobbly, and it was annoying enough to make me want to change places, but we were engrossed in conversation, so I decided to try to ignore it. The server did come around once to clear away trash and ask if we needed anything, and I wasn't expecting extra attention in a casual burger joint, so that was nice. However, when we left the restaurant at 1:30, the trash can that had been filled to overflowing during the lunch rush had not yet been emptied. That would have been gross enough on its own, but someone had spilled guacamole all over the opening of the trash can, down the side, and onto the floor in front of the can. This was the kind of trash can that you have to push open the flap on the front in order to dump your garbage inside, so it was rather disgusting to have to deal with that. For the two of us, lunch was about $22. That got us one burger, one side, and an ice water each. So, overall, it was a pretty decent place to grab a quick, freshly-made hot meal. Just don't expect too much. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This was my 3rd time here and very disappointed!! They had NO salsa bar, no one ordering food but it took about 10 min to have some one come and ask what i wanted. The counters were dirty like they caught something on fire and the ambers blew on to them. Ordered 3 Carne Asada Tacos and a Carne Asada burrito. Also chips and guacamole. It was $4.15 for chips and guacamole and it wasn't worth it. The chips were hard, stale and the guacamole was flavorless. The Carne Asada tasted like it wAs cooked with fish! Awful!!

 I love Ian's! It's such a Madison staple; I always have to stop by when I'm visiting family in WI. Ian's has such a fun variety...everything from mac 'n cheese pizza to baked potato pizza to salad pizza. Yes, salad pizza. I'm personally a big fan of the buffalo chicken with bleu cheese, but I like to try something new every time. So far, not a single experiment has gone poorly for me. The atmosphere feels very much like a college campus. It can be crowded, noisy, and full of students. Depending on when you go (such as lunchtime), the line can get very long, but the service is fast and friendly so the wait is manageable. I highly recommend a trip next time you're on State Street.

 Overpriced, sub-par food can be forgiven if the service is decent. I've been in the service industry for a long time and understand what rude customers and being in the weeds is all about. When a restaurant is nearly empty and servers are standing around, there is no excuse for bad service. They make minimum wage, customers' tips are their bread and butter, if they are at least nice or pretend like they don't hate their job. Our drinks were not refilled once, dirty dinner plates and long finished appetizers were on the table when we left, after dessert. The thin, dark haired manager (if that's what they call him), is the worst!!! Managers are there to smooth out situations, he made ours worse.

 If you don't feel like reading my entire review, let me just summarize it here, SAVE YOUR $$ and MOVE ON! MINUS 5 SUCKS HOT @$$! Thanks for ruining my 30th Birthday! I had high hopes for this place but was utterly disappointed over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I wanted to do something different in Vegas for my 30th birthday so I told all my friends that I wanted to go to the Minus 5 Ice Lounge...MISTAKE #1. Once we arrived, we were told that we have to pick a package to enter this place. The prices range from $15-$75. We opt for the $37 package which gave us a parka, gloves and 2 cocktails. Before you head in there they ask you to put your cell phones and electronics into a locker...had I know what I know now I would've snuck my camera in...MISTAKE #2. Once everyone was ready to go inside they run down the rules of this place. Once you're finally inside...one word...CROWDED and small!! if you hate tight and cold spaces, this is def. not the place for you. The bartender was probably the best thing in that place he had hooked it up at the bar with an extra shot. So after my 2 cocktails were done...I was still waiting to take a group picture for my birthday. Something to save the memories of coming here. The camera girl, MARY, came around took our photo but then said that the flash wasn't working properly so she would go and fix it and come back. 10 mins later, MARY, came back in the room but does she come to take our photo? NO! she starts to take photos of people who JUST GOT THERE?! How are you going to tell a paying customer you will be back and then not do what you said?! Finally, she came back around to us and once again...FLASH IS OUT?!?! WTF?!?! MARY, tells us the same BS again, oh it's broken I'll be back. 10 more mins after she comes back once again she does the SAME BS! I didn't mind that she had to go fix her camera but wtf if you say you're going to come back, then fucking COME BACK. this time, instead of coming straight to us for our photo, once again...the B goes and takes a photo of another couple who just got in who sat next to us. MARY, even has the nerve to tell me to GET OUT OF THE WAY! are you F-ing kidding me?! that was the last straw, in my mind MINUS 5 was dead to me. We complained to the General Manager Marc...DONT BOTHER! it's like speaking to a broken record. Def. does not know customer service and def. should be retrained in it!!

 My husband and I have been to LOTS of Japanese restaurants with an AYCE option and this place is the WORST. The seaweed salad was old, shrimp tempura was tough with a thick batter, and the mussels were also tough and neither any of these were edible at all. The sushi rolls should have been called rice rolls but at least they were edible. The only thing that we liked was the miso soup but who goes wrong on that? The service didn't help their case either. Our server, well, she was the only server there, was very arrogant and rude. She wanted us to finish every little thing on our plate, mind you, we can hardly eat anything we ordered. We should have known better as we were the only ones in there on a Saturday. We were out the door 45 minutes later, hungry and disappointed. Such a waste of money and time. Please be warned that you are better off going somewhere else like Oyshi or Sushi Kaya. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Nice course, awful hospitality. We were harassed all day to keep up a 4:15 pace (on cart path only day). We finished 4:23, but that wasn't good enough for these grumpy dudes. A marshall named Chuck chased me down when I went to the bathroom at the turn (I'm not allowed to pee?) and told me I was holding up play. The 7th time the marshall came up to us, we told him to kick rocks. Head Pro Brian came out afterwards and continued the harassment. I have never seen anything like it, there are plenty other of courses to play in they valley, so don't come here if you are looking for a relaxing round. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My wife and I found Angel's Blessing Spa online. We were visiting from out of town and hate to pay the strip prices for massage. Even with the cost of taxi to and from the day spa, it was less than it would've been to pay the outrageous prices on the strip. I had Aya and my wife had Armando. As soon as we saw each other at the end of our massages we gave each other the thumbs up. We both loved the massages. They paid attention to what we liked and changed the pressure accordingly. Aya used several different techniques during my massage including pressure points, deep tissue and stretches. We each got an hour and a half massage and came out feeling relaxed and ready for the rest of our vacation on the Las Vegas strip! Angel's Blessing's Spa is amazing! I strongly recommend it. I can't wait to get back to Vegas so I can get another massage from Aya! ",0,0,0,0,1

 A classy, fun place to go for a nice change of pace. I like cigars, and I enjoy a good drink (away from the douchebagg-y Old Town scene), and this place fits the bill well. Great selection of cigars that are well-kept in a walk in humidor, great selection of beer as well as spirits. I'm not a frequent whiskey drinker, so I can't speak to the fairness of those prices, but the smokes and beer are fairly priced in my opinion.

 Today my daughter went to the LC and they lost the order and she did not get the food for over 45 minutes. The said the order was not placed in 'it was lost for a few minutes'. The order goes from the counter where you place the order to less than 10 feet away to the cooking area. She probably wished she had just left because she got food poisoning from the Los Chief salad. She had a large order and the food was placed in a cardboard box that she took to her car. NONE of the plates inside of the box were secured for travel; simply two paper plates with the food on the bottom plates. The enchiladas spilled off the plate and the poisoned Los Chief salad placed between the plates also spilled off. They used to put the salad in a bowl and tape it shut. She said the tortilla for the cheese crisp was stale and just lousy tasting. I'd warned her I no longer would order anything but their shredded beef tacos. I use to get the green chili burrito but the last time I ordered it was made with a store bought tortilla. It was gross. My family has been going to this restaurant since the 60's. The food was excellent and service outstanding. However; the owner of the restaurant Mary died and the food has been going to h*ll rapidly. The service is with a snotty attitude that the management is doing a favor to serve to the customer. There's just too many good Mexican restaurants to waste your money here! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I don't like to give out 5 stars being that it's the mecca of ratings and all, but this place nailed it. It has it all, great food, great service, and great atmosphere. I was torn between the Salmon Tartini (I think that's what it was called) and the choriza enchillada. I'm pretty sure neither would be a miss, but I heard through the grapevine that their chef makes the chorizo. Thus, I was directed that way. It was a great tasting dish, perfect for my Sunday hangover. I also had a peanut butter and banana protein shake which I sucked down like the Hoover Dam! It was delicious. If you like a little live entertainment, I'd suggest hanging out at the bar and observing the very friendly, outgoing staff (all good looking women as well, always a plus!). Before I blew that hot dog stand, I grabbed a coffee to go. I don't know what it was, but it was the perfect blend of smooth and bold. I can't wait until next time to try out that Salmon! ",0,0,0,0,1

 This is a wonderful alternative to going on vacation at a fancy resort. The options are limitless and the attractions are many. There truly is something for everyone here. They have a kids area with rides from your elementary school carnival. You know the slide that takes off a layer of skin and shocks your ass all the way down? Also, the tilt-a-whirl, no doubt filled with sun-baked vomit. There is a petting zoo, and you can even feed and ride miniature livestock! You can buy a bird here, and even get a brazillian wax for $45 from a toothless woman. Dining options include pork rinds, funnel cakes, and snow cones. In all seriousness, it's only $2, the people watching is decent, they have beer, and you might find something cool. I didn't think the prices were spectacular, but maybe I have unrealistic expectations. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My girlfriend and I came here for a pedicure last Saturday since she lives right around the corner. When we walked in, there appeared to be a wait, so we asked how long the wait would be before we opted to stay. There were two female technicians doing manicures and one male technician doing the pedicure. One of the women told us 15-20 minutes so we decided to wait. The guy started up the foot baths and invited us to have seat and soak our feet while we waited. 35 minutes later and he is just coming over to start on my feet. The guy was really slow and kept doublechecking what he was doing. I am not sure how often he does pedicures. About 25 minutes into it, he was getting ready to start on the leg massage at which point I asked that he paint my nails because I couldn't stay much longer. This whole time my friend was still waiting on her pedicure (50 minutes) soaking her feet. About the end of my fast-forward pedi, one of the nail technicians came over to start on my friend and apologized to both of us for the wait and how long it took. And the weird thing was that the polish I chose ended up being way lighter on my toes than it looked in the bottle. So, not only was I not able to receive the full pedicure but I didn't get the color I wanted. Yes, I could have asked them to change the polish but I didn't have enough time. Had the wait truly been 15-20 minutes, this would have been a non-issue. The basic pedi was $21. For that price, I have had better pedis but I can probably forgive alot for a $20 pedi. Luckily, I don't need to come here because I got the bomb spots in CenPho. ",0,1,0,0,0

 On a recent trip to Las Vegas we were going to attend a special midnight showing at the AMC Town Square Theater. After a long day at a local convention, we decided to head to the theater early and chose a place to eat that was near the venue. Once we arrived the decision was made to eat at McFadden's Irish Pub, since several members of our group of 8 loved it when it was located at the Rio. Since there is no better endorsement than from close friends, we decided to give it a try. We arrived around 9:00 and sat at a high-top table near the bar and dance floor. The eight of us crowded around the table, took our seats, and were greeted shortly by Tanya, our server. She took our drink orders and brought them back shortly and took our food orders. By 9:15 she had taken our dinner orders. It is worth noting that this group of eight hadn't eaten since lunch. 20 minutes later we started wondering about our food. No one ordered anything special or difficult. It's a pub, so the food isn't terribly complicated. There were a few burgers, nachos, and chicken wings. Nothing fancy. 30 minutes later we continued to wonder about our food when we noticed that other tables around us who had food orders hadn't received their orders, either. By this time it's 9:45 and not only are we very hungry, but we're starting to get unpleasant (this group of eight hasn't eaten since lunch). Tanya came around and offered a round of drinks on the house (thank you!), but the fact that food still wasn't on the table is the actual issue at hand. By this time several of us were getting low blood sugar and getting what my wife refers to as ""food headaches"". Irritability starts to set in. At 10:00 two things happened to make this dining experience worse. 1) The lights were dimmed to the point that you could barely see what was in front of you and 2) the music was turned up. WAY up. Like, to 11. At this point talking to the person next to you was an exercise in futility. At about 10:10 food started coming out...for other tables. While there seemed to be a moratorium on food for the better part of an hour, there were signs of sustenance ahead. Meals were delivered, two or three plates at a time, to the table next to us and to a table that was seated after us, and one or two to our table, seemingly as a side note. By the time the last meal was delivered to our table it was 10:25, meaning that the meals that were delivered previously had cooled down, but nothing was said because A) We didn't want to wait another hour for any problems to get fixed and B) We had a deadline we had to meet. There were no problems with any of the meals (aside from the cooling down of those delivered 15 minutes before the last one was), and everything tasted fine, despite not being able to see what we were eating. We ate hurriedly, being unable to really enjoy our meals because of the completely unacceptable service time. No sooner did my wife eat her last bite when she had to walk out of the establishment due to the volume of the music. We don't know what happened. Did the cook just come in to work? Did the kitchen staff take an abnormally long break? Were they waiting on their supplier to deliver the food? We were never given an explanation as to why the food was so delayed. Would I recommend this eatery to anyone? Based on this visit, ABSOLUTELY NOT. While Tanya was pleasant and did what she could, the real problem was out of her hands and lies squarely with the kitchen and the (lack of) management. There are reasonable expectations that food delivery is going to be timely. This Was Not The Case. There are reasonable expectations that the atmosphere will be conducive to enjoying your meal. Exceedingly loud music and very low light made that rather impossible. As much as I'd like to give this establishment a great review, I simply can't. Accurate orders and an attentive server don't make up for lousy service times and an atmosphere that's seemingly designed to keep diners away...or to drive them away to make room for the bar patrons.

 Have to give a shout out to this place. Although I have only gone to ""Cocktails"" a few times in the last few years, it will always have a special place in my heart. Flash back 25 years ago. My Dad used to take me here for happy hour with his work buddies. Some may say that isn't good parenting. Maybe its not. But I have very fond memories of sitting up at the bar getting my cheeks pinched by the bartender and the patrons. The nice, smoky voiced, wrinkly blond female bartender would put a zillion maraschino cherries in my shirley temple. And I would play darts with my Daddy. I feel warm and fuzzy just thinking about it. Once I would hit adulthood I would stop in every so often. Though my life was constantly changing this bar just felt like home. Another warm fuzzy memory? My brother proposed to his amazing wife here on New Years Eve a few years ago. I wasn't there at the time, but he text me pictures after the proposal.

 One of the best burritio I've ever had. That's high praise, I know. The short rib meat was fantastic and the burrito construction was just perfect.

I hear you...it is expensive but then again, you probably will eat $8 in chips and salsa before you get that burrito. Throw in the delicious rice and beans side it comes with and you're getting a fair price. I've also had the crips (think mexican pizza) and the enchiladas. Both were very good but I'll be sticking with burritos in the future. Additionally they have a good happy hour M-F with 1/2 price apps. The guac is definitely worth ordering. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have a feeling that this place probably appeals to individuals with more of an East cost experience with chicken fingers (though I could be wrong, but I will explain). As others have noted, it is family owned, not a chain, and the owner is extremely polite and that is god thing. I ordered the regular chicken fingers plate with fries and a piece of Texas Toast and got an extra chicken finger because I was a new customer. For the sauces, and there is a number of selections, I got the blue cheese sauce and the house specialty. Being more used to Texas style chicken fingers I tend to like a think coating of batter (like chicken fried steak, dredged in an egg wash, and then flour and preferably twice). These seemed like they were just dredged in seasoned flour and then fried. So, fries were okay, Texas toast is like a thick piece of garlic toast and well, it was basically cooked chicken that you could dip into the sauce. Honestly, I think the chicken fingers from Popeye's are much better. If you like the style of chicken fingers they offer, then great but not really my thing, though I give kudo's to the owner for providing great service. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This old hotel has a convenient location with some rooms offering a nice lake or capitol view. The building itself, rooms, and furnishings are dated. Even in the upgraded ""Governor's Club"" the rooms seem old. The a/c units are noisy, the mattresses are old & lifeless, and worst of all, the walls are paper thin. You can hear your neighbors shuffling papers, talking, and flushing their toilets. The nicest thing in the room was the plasma TV. They offer free wifi on site but the signal was far from reliable. So there's an open bar if you upgrade to the Governor's Club. They advertise ""top shelf"" booze but it's really mid-shelf. The complementary breakfast, snacks, and desserts are hit or miss. There is a decent fitness center, sauna, and whirlpool. For serious meatheads the gym won't cut it. The cardio machines are adequate and there are lcd panels to watch TV but there is only 1 pulley machine and a very limited selection of free weights.

 We went in today to look at (and potentially purchase) a new Nissan Pathfinder. We already own a Nissan Altima and really like it. So we decided we would buy another Nissan. The initial sales guy, Joe, was really good. He was very easy to talk to and didn't pressure us at all. It wasn't until we met with the manger, Mike J, that everything went downhill. Unfortunately Joe lost the sale because of Mike and I will never return to Larry H Miller Nissan Mesa because of him. To sum it up, when he walked up, he immediately told us that we would only pay sticker price for the Pathfinder; no one ever pays sticker price. He also told us that there were no Pathfinders on the lot and this was why sticker price was the best deal. Joe had told us there were 17 on the lot. When I got home, I verified on their online inventory that they had 17 Pathfinders. So bull on this too. Every word out of this guy's mouth was a lie. He indicated that the only way he would talk to us was if we would be buying right then and there with no questions or haggling. When he was done with us, he told us good bye and didn't even give us a chance to say anything before he turned around and walked away. Because of Mike, I will never return to or suggest Larry H Miller Nissan Mesa to anyone. If this is the attitude of the managers, I can only imagine what the rest of the buying process or even service at this place would be like. ",1,0,0,0,0

We were also brought out complimentary champagne and the server refused to accept a tip! It was such a nice way to start our stay at Caesars! We then purchased $65 pitchers of rock candy lemonade (not virgin), and it was amazing. We ended up lounging by the pool for 6 hours.

 This place was disgusting, and of course by disgusting I mean awesome. And I suppose I also mean disgusting, because lets face it, Pomeroy's is not intended for the faint of heart. A group of us came pummeling on Saturday night after Amber W. and the Second Time Ever boys were kind enough to give us a Sunnyslope Art Walk preview (which kicked ass by the way) and immediately I was hooked. $2.75 Amber Bocks ALL DAY and a late night menu with grilled cheeses, chicken fingers, and mozzarella sticks? Where do I sign up? Like seriously, that is my holy trifecta of late night bar food, and this particular bar food was delicious. And I can say that with great confidence because believe it or not, I wasn't drunk, so I could actually taste it : ) Be prepared to wait though, because the service for certain members of our party (sorry Jordan) was SLOW. Yes, the table was filthy and no one once came over to clean it. Yes, the clientele was a bit on the unwashed side. And yes, there were at least 5 people in there that wanted to kill me for no other reason that I made the mistake of walking in with a designer bag. But listen, Pomeroys make's ZERO excuses for itself, and really, what self-respecting dive bar should? That said, before my next visit to Pomeroys, I will dirty myself up a bit and dress in the finest wife beater I own, and it will be on, because no amount of salty bar patrons will stand between me and my $2.75 Amber Bocks, so don't even try...

However, this was not al a dente, but simply undercooked. When you bit in the pasta, there was still a hard, uncooked ""core."" It needed a few more minutes of cooking time.

 Had heard a lot of people mention this over the last couple years in Charlotte, so a friend and I (who had also never been to this place) decided to try it for lunch on a weekday. I met her there and the place was typical of a bar/pub. The back patio looked nice and large, which is where I've heard it's really chill to drink out back during the summer, but as this was a cooler day in Charlotte (high 30's), this was not so appealing. The staff was helpful and friendly and pretty attentive, so this was clearly not what caused me to give them 2 stars. It was the food. I had a burger w/ fries and my friend had a BLT w/ fries. It's not that it wasn't cooked properly or wasn't decent, it's just that it wasn't anything special and when it comes to bar/pub food in Charlotte, there certainly are other places that are much, much better. All in all, it felt more like a bar/pub restaurant chain more than a neighborhood hangout and I was certainly expecting more. Like I said, it might be a cool bar to hang out during the summer, but not a restaurant that should necessarily be sought after. I'll probably give it another chance if someone wanted to go there, but won't be convincing my friends to go have a meal there. ",0,1,0,0,0

 great steaks at a great value compared to other strip places. Free mashed potatoes and salad were forgettable but cant really complain if they are free. Also some nice happy hour deals ($5 top shelf cocktails). On top of that they currently have a half off groupon which is just about the best discount to quality of food ratios you will find in Vegas right now. As far as other steakhouses in this price range, I prefer The Barrymore and Envy for their higher level of sides (which are not free) and a nicer selection of non-steak entrees. But their steaks are very comparable. One thing to note, my wife and i actually had a difficult time ordering enough food to use all of our 50 for 100 groupon since she ordered a burger instead of a steak. We ended up ordering 2 desserts even though we were completely stuffed to use the rest of our groupon voucher. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Chose this place because of the great yelp reviews. I have to say that I agree. They did my car very well. When I got there, they warned me up front that it was going to be a little bit of a wait. I appreciated that. I would rather know than not know. They did a nice job. Does not look as fancy as Fabulous Freddy's. I really appreciate their good manners and the nice job that they did. No complaints. The day after I notice that they did not vacuum my trunk. Still happy with them overall. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because I do like the food at Panera in general. This location and the customer service are terrible here, to the point where I won't even bother going anymore. I work in the area and have given way more chances than I should have for them to try to redeem themselves. The staff seems as though they have no training in customer service, I even called one day to complain to a manager because I was apparently interrupting a conversation between a cashier and a customer who already paid. The customer even said, ""Oh, I'm sorry. You can take care of her"". The cashier proceeded to say ""It's ok, she can wait"". Are you kidding me?! That was a first at any restaurant I'd ever been to. Another time I went in during the evening, the place was basically empty. The cashier asked if she could take my order, I told one minute I was deciding. She walked into the back and didn't come back, I waited for someone to come help me which they didn't so I left. I don't have too much to say about the parking lot because I would walk there but I know it's hard to get in and get out. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Stopped by at this location to meet a friend for lunch and to use my gift card there. We tried the 2 for $25 special. Not a bad deal, but what a drabby decor. It just looks ancient compared to the one that I've been to in Scottsdale. The special comes with a large plate, soup or a salad bowl, one dessert or appetizer. We each chose a meal, shared the salad and a good-size tiramisu. Our bill came to $27 after tax. The server was okay. She sneezed while taking our order, and I think she used her hand to cover her mouth! I quickly looked away and hoped she washed her hands. I mean, she's human but I just wished it didn't happen right then. Later, she got confused about the tip. She came back after I paid and asked if I wanted change and I was like, ""Yeah."" And she responded, ""Oh okay, let me go and get it."" And I'm thinking, why did she come back without it? She already pocket it. I always tip, I just didn't want to give her that specific amount. Needless to say, I won't go back to that location because it needs a facelift. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I, too, decided on MCN based on Yelp reviews after moving to Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, I did not have the great experience others did. I ended up getting probably the worst haircut I'd had in 10 years. It ended up a good 4 inches shorter than I discussed with the stylist. In addition, she took the fact that I work in a professional office to mean that I wanted an ugly, boring, mom-ish haircut. It's taken almost a year to grow back to the length it was before. I admittedly should have complained then and there, but I'm a wuss. Additionally, the experience at the salon left much to be desired. I went in the late morning on a weekday. There was a little girl there (around 3 or 4) with her nanny. Apparently her mom was a regular customer. The little girl was getting a haircut and she cried and screamed for 25 minutes. I know kids will be kids, and I don't blame the little girl for being scared or cranky. I do blame the salon for not finding a way for the girl not to disrupt the entire salon - taking her to a back room, taking her outside to calm down, not allowing children in an adult, supposedly high-end salon, etc. Something that was supposed to be a treat for me turned into a headache. I will not be back here, but it seems like others had great experiences. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I could not agree more with Alicia B's review. I went here with my husband Saturday night, it is in our nieghboorhood and we had heard decent things. We waited about 10 minutes for a table, not because it was full or busy. The hostess looked a right at us, no acknowledgement and then she went on to what must have been more important business. Finally, a passing waiter sat us. The service continued to be inattentive and slow. Our cocktails were tasty, I had a pomegranire margarita and my husband has something with a kooky name, I think it mentioned a Donkey. We had the Queso with crab which was pretty good, the crab could have been tastier and the whole thing needed some spice. The chips and salsa, OK. I had the carnitas, after recommendation by our waitress. Not bad, but certainly not good and not worth $17. My Husband has the seafood crepes, they were OK, but lacking flavor. The food was not bland, but flat, just meh. This place would be a 3 star, but for the price, it is coming down to a 2 star. The building and patio are really cool and set a good atmosphere, too bad the food and service don't follow suit. On a side note I did get to overhear a great conversation by two guys visiting from out of town, probably in thier mid to late 40s. I guess last time they came here the women were way hotter. This time there are hot women, but they are not as common. They seemed to like the place, one of them remarked the only thing better than his food was getting laid earlier that day. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I tend to stay away from restaurants that have a celebrity chef attached to it. I wondered how much time did Bobby Flay actually spend in this restaurant? I admire Bobby Flay and I have had some of the dishes he inspired and like what he does with flavors. I figured Mesa would be a safe bet when I was asked to choose the place for a group of six. It was better than safe, it was excellent. The service was excellent. The gruop wasn't in a rush, and the waitress didn't rush us. She spent a lot of time asnwering questions without a hit of annoyance. I had the coffee rubbed Filet Mignon and it is probabyl the best steak I have ever had. I didn't need a steak knife, it fell apart. There was something about the coffee rub that is going to compell me to go through hsi cookbooks in hopes I find what exactly is in it. Other notable items on the table were Goat Cheese Queso Fundido, heirloom tomato salad. Both were excellent. The side of mashed potatoes was really good. This is a top notch restaurant! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I hadn't been to a Steak 'N Shake in years. We used to go quite often when I lived back east since they were open 24 hours and it was a good spot to hit after a night out drinking. I'm not sure if my taste buds have just changed, if the burgers I've had here and in LA have upped my burger requirements, or if this particular one just kinda sucks, but it's definitely not what I remember! So my first complaint are the hours here. This is a 24 hour town, yet this Steak 'N Shake closes at either midnight or 1am depending on the day. That's pretty lame. I'd personally never even eaten at the chain back east until at least 2am, so eating here during the day was a first for me. And this was my first experience ever eating here sober too. I always remember their shoestring fries being insanely good and crispy! Not here thou, they were very bland and almost mushy. I remember the burgers being very tasty, but it was just blah, barely a step up from someplace like Micky D's. I ordered a shake for old times sake and it took forever to arrive. I would've liked to have it during my meal, especially since I ordered it at the same time. But it didn't arrive until I had about 2 bite left of my meal. That was pretty annoying! All in all, I really doubt I'll be returning. The line to get in was ridiculously long, so the 30+ minute wait for a bland and underwhelming meal wasn't something I'd like to repeat anytime soon.

 Booked their economy car from 6/1-6/3... I already decided I wasn't going to pay more than I saw advertised on Southwest.com so as I made my way through their waiting lane, I put my game face on. The guy behind the counter took one look at me, and decided since I had boobs, I was probably going to cave in to his suave sales talk. Yeah, not really. So the conversation went like this: Do you want to buy the extra insurance? No thanks. Do you want to upgrade to a mid-size sedan? No thanks. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Do you have kids? Yes, I have two. Well then you should upgrade to a mid-size since you need a lot of room for all their stuff. No, I only have an umbrella stroller & don't need the extra space. Well are you planning to go shopping? Um, maybe...? Our economy cars don't have a trunk so where will you put your things so other people don't see it? (By now I've had it with the arm twisting). What do you mean the car doesn't have a trunk? Our economy cars are hatchbacks, no trunks, no power windows, no power locks, it's just basic. Ok, that's fine- basic will be just fine-- I only need it for a couple days. Obviously defeated, he graciously shut his trap & continued to explain to me that since I was using a debit card, the deposit of $70 was now going to be $250 (WTH? At this point, I just wanted to leap over the counter & smack him with my purse). He assured me I was going to receive a full refund of my deposit within 10 days of returning the rental. I figure, I need the darn car, and I have now your full name, physical description & contact info. You better not be fibbing. It turns out when I went to pick up my rental, my cute little economy car DID have a GINORMOUS trunk, power windows, power doors, and thank God Almighty, AC. Sure, I felt like I was driving around in a Barbie Power Wheel, but the gas mileage was awesome! No thanks to Rico Suave at the counter.

 Hands down the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. My friend and I were in town for the weekend, so we had to hit up Primanti's. I lived in the 'burgh for about three years, and have had it before (from the dahn-tahn location) but my friend hadn't. We came in at 1pm on a Sunday, certainly not busy at all. We sat at a table by the bar for about 15 minutes being ignored until we got fed up and sat at the bar instead. My friend and I ordered a sandwich each and I asked for no cole slaw. Seeing as how I'm pretty sure that these sandwiches are not pre-made, I didn't think it was a big deal. The waitress stared blankly at the ceiling and replied ""I'll see what I can do."" Eventually, our food got there and it was okay, not the greatness I had built up to my friend. It took about 20 minutes for the waitress to bring the tab after asking for it (I almost thought about committing my first dine and ditch out of mercy). We had to flag down a different waitress to take our money. For the first time in my life, I left no tip. ",1,0,0,0,0

 A thoroughly underwhelming experience. Before you've had chance to get comfy in your seat the waiter is trying to upsell you on bottled water. Hey Mr. Ruth or Mr. Chris or whoever's in charge here, I'm paying close to $50 for your steak, cut me some slack on the water, okay? It doesn't get much better from there. A ridiculously over-dark dining room sees older patrons using flashlights to read the menu. And then, the steak... it's barely above grocery-store quality. And even if it was good meat, why smother it in 500-degree butter? Let the meat speak for itself. Recently dined at Carsons in Milwaukee and the meat was way way better quality and less expensive. In summary, dinner at Ruths Chris came to: One NY strip, one Ribeye, , one lobster bisque and a shared plate of fries and a drink = $160 with tip. Hard to see why we would ever go back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Rooms are small, but then again... it's a casino hotel. They WANT you to be uncomfortable in the room so you'll be more likely to gamble downstairs. Also, the walls are exceptionally thin. There was a pervasive odor of stale cigarettes throughout the hotel. Either the air scrubbers weren't doing their job or something was off. I was there a week and it was not until the last night that I figured out that it was the plastic mattress pads on the beds that made me so irrationally hot every night, waking up in a pool of sweat. Really? Plastic mattress pads in a supposedly 4 star hotel?? The good? Thomas, the concierge. First rate guy with wonderful recommendations. Would I stay there again? Probably not.

 So this place is located, for any of you locals who have been in the area for a while, where Beef Eaters used to be. Across from the restaurant is a book store and it looked as if there was another shop onsite as well. I liked the Po' Boys sandwich that I had.

 I liked the atmosphere and staff a lot. Very nice and easy to communicate with. I didn't have a wait at all, and was in and out in less than an hour. I had a mani-pedi and felt relaxed and pampered. The scrub and hot towel treatment was Devine. Normally before I go for a pedicure, I always trim my own toenails because I always find, wherever I've gone, that the nail technician cuts them too short and I get an infected ingrown toenail. Well, this time I forgot to pre-trim and I allowed the nail tech to cut them for me. Sure enough, she went too short. It hurt the next day and when I was at Disneyland 4 days later, I had to wear flip flops so it wouldn't hurt more. But I blame myself more than I do the nail tech. Overall, I am pleased.

 Beer 5 star Food 3 star Service 1 star Atmosphere 1 star Not as awestruck as I had thought I would be. Food was very hit or miss. Recommend reading the menu very well or you could get someone's attempt at a sweet savory burger that is too far in either direction to blend well. Do try the wings and the hot pretzel. The Matador was pretty good too, reminded me of a Philly steak sandwich but on a pretzel bun. My husband had the ""Meat Treat"" flat bread pizza. It was good but we had to ask the waitress where it was, she returned to tell us ""they are remaking your order, it will be up in a few (was not a few) minutes."" I realize it's Friday night, and they were busy, but after our initial seating we had to flag the waitress down for everything and then she would disappear again. Once I flagged her down, she would immediately dart off, and I'd have to say ""WAIT.."" or she'd take one person's order and leave without asking if anyone else needed anything. The ketchup that was served with the fries, was pretty awful. That needs to go. The house pop tart, tastes very much like the Pillsbury dough boy made it.

 If there were a negative star for this hospital that's what I would give it. I had my daughter here after hearing what a great hospital it is to have a child. Let's forget that my Doctor never showed up and that his partner who had 2 years experience finally did the C-section after 15 hours of labor. Forget that she was in distress before they did anything, forget that I was in a labor room the whole time, forget that my blood pressure dropped so low that my brother had to alert them that I was passing out. Those things can happen. But I can't forget that when I was feeding my daughter the nurse told me she is either eating a lot or you are bringing the food home. Nice comment, excuse me ""accusation"". I will never forget that when my bandage that they use to support the cut from the c-section was being replaced by myself in the bathroom, the nurse, or whoever she was repremanded me when I went to throw it away. She told me ""oh no, we wash them and re-use them"". I was mortified!. I told her, ""not on me we don't"" Ok, so I will forget all of that. This is the thing I will never forget. ""I got Mercer infection before I left the hospital and it was dismissed"" When I called infectious deseases, they didn't even want to hear it, they never called me back. My wonderful Dr. told me I would have to take 2 rounds of a heavy duty anti-biotic and get my bandages changed every day and I would have to go into a clinic to have it done.

 My husband and I have been to Char's twice now and we will be going again. Its a very little place, dark, small dance floor. The type of place you can wear comfy shoes and jeans and really get out and dance, just plain fun. If you get there right when they open you'll have no trouble finding a seat. The place does fill up quick though, after 10 it's standing room only. The two bands we have seen have been a lot of fun, very eclectic, very good. Service the first time was great. Service the second time SUCKED. Took forever to get drinks, and even longer to get our checks. They accept cards, but I suggest cash, there is nothing worse than being held hostage when the waitress cannot find the time to bring you your card to close the tab.

 The first time I came to Vegas, we were staying at the Paris, which apparently is just too full of functional, non-gambling or drinking adults with children for me and my girls, so we headed for the Sahara and its $2 No Bust Blackjack tables. We basically spent our entire vacation at those tables. The dealers were fun and friendly, even the pit bosses chatted with us. Okay, granted, we were there for like three staff changes (no sleep is necessary in Vegas due to all that extra oxygen they pump onto the casino floor) but they really were cool. Minus two stars for Paco's Bar and Grill. A steady 13 hour diet of Bud Light clouded my judgment to the point of thinking that eating Mexican food at a desert-themed, low-budget casino would be a good idea. Well, Bud Light was wrong and I scored some impressive FBI (food borne illness) but danged if I didn't lose 5lbs on that trip. I still love the Sahara, though, and I continue to return for blackjack every time I'm in Vegas. Come on, it has its own ""NASCAR Experience"" in it! I don't know what that is, but I'm pretty sure it's Bud Light and crappy Mexican food, which sure as hell beats cappucinos and mimes at the Paris any day! ",0,0,1,0,0

Not cool and no apology was offered either. 3. Food was just awful. Poor quality ingredients. Peanut chicken was supposed to be spicy: hardly any peanut flavour and no spice. Garlic shrimp was meh and deep fried?? Saut \ u00e9ed veg had no flavour but lots of oil. Best thing on my plate was the broth from my soup! I can't say more - crossed off our list forever.

 Originally a vaudeville theatre built in 1914, the Imperial is a Historic Monument owned by a non-profit organization and is the homebase for many film festivals that come through town. Watching a film here feels like a classy, out of time event. The lobby, the gorgeous ceiling, the balcony, all softly swoon worthy - the restoration was award-winning for a reason. It's wonderful that this place survived so many decades of change and offers such a soul-soothing space to experience the magic of movies. But they just don't show enough of them! The schedule should be packed, as far as I'm concerned, with the best modern and historic cinema has to offer, but all too often it sits empty waiting to be rented out for events. I think you could fill this place 3 times a day with creative programming involving the local university film programs and art galleries... just sayin. ",0,0,0,1,0

 If I was on shrooms I would have freaked out! I kept thinking about the scene in ""Knocked up"" where the guys are watching a Cirque Du Soleil show. Overall this was a very entertaining show. My second time watching it now and I've been impressed both times. Seating: All seats are good really. Can't complain...front row might get a little wet. There is so much going on that you pretty much won't see everything, but will get the overall idea of the show. Pricing: Very reasonable priced. Show: Very entertaining. Great production and acrobatics. The music, lighting, and action is amazing. You really do feel like you're in some crazy dream. There are many details that you won't catch the 1st time around. The show itself is the perfect length of time...short enough to get your money's worth and long enough to not get bored. They do have a snack bar as well and you can snack on popcorn, soda, mixed drinks, and beer while enjoying the show.

 OK, it's been a while since I had a fast food burger, but it was moving day for my lovely daughter Whitney, yesterday. The menu selection for moving day lunch is ""bag of burgers"" for the moving crew, of which I was a part. If you are going to do chain, drive through burgers, you can do far worse than Whataburger (I mean you MickieD, and you too, Burger King!). I like the fact that Whataburger toasts the buns and smears on a little butter flavored...something, grease, oil, lard...I have no idea, but it adds to the taste and doesn't make me ill, so thumbs up! They don't get the order wrong any more often than any other drive through place, and when they do, they have remade the order without attitude, so that's nice. Over the years, I have tried a couple of other things on their menu, and they do a pretty good job with a chicken sandwich and sausage biscuit from their breakfast menu. Again, far superior to some of their national competitors. Good for the moving day ""bag of burgers"", but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there (BTW, when is Lucky Boy going to put a place in Old Town Scottsdale?). ",0,0,1,0,0

Don't be fooled by the price this isn't a child-sized portion either. We were able to eat there but the seating is quite limited. That being said, that particular restaurant is clean and tidy (though not much to look at), but the surrounding mall is somewhat abandoned/dirty. Service is super-fast ...as in 2 minutes later you will have you sandwich in hand. We couldn't bring ourselves to venture past the #6 as it was perfect. I will say it tasted better when we ate it there as the bread hardens slightly on the take-out drive home. We had some beverage options aloe juice ( a personal favorite of mine-so refreshing), white-gourd juice (tasted like amaretto but neither of us enjoyed it), and a strawberry sunrise bubble-tea ( I hate nesquik, and the flavor was very similar...wasn't a fan). We also had the sunflour cookies, which were visually appealing but skip-worthy. I will stick to the banh-mi sandwiches and aloe juice and be on my merry way! ",0,0,0,1,0

 We arrived at PH on Thursday night to check in to our room (that had already been previously paid for). We were asked if we wanted to upgrade our room for $20 per night. We said that would be great and I left my debit card open in case we wanted room service. A day later I checked my balance and they had taken $400 as a deposit. I was in disbelief. So I called down to have them close my card out and bill me for the $20 per night upgrade. Now they inform me there are $24 per night resort fees. Was never told about these charges either. Plus, I already paid my resort fees when I initially paid for the room. So why am I being billed for something twice? They couldn't give me a straight answer to that question. So after the $20 upgrade per night, the $24 resort fee per night, and the tax...I had a $185 room upgrade. Honestly, that's not a bad upgrade fee for being on the 37th floor (one floor below the penthouse) with a Vegas Strip view. I am not upset about that. I am really upset about the $400 deposit and the lack of information given at the time of the upgrade. Overall, the room was extremely clean, and very nice. King Size bed was very comfortable. We hardly heard any street noise. A/C was very quiet and cooled the room very quickly. Bathroom was very clean. Be sure to ask all the details of an ""upgrade"" before agreeing. You may not like all of the hidden fees that started out as a simple ""$20 upgrade"". ",0,0,1,0,0

 Just spent two nights here last week and had no issues whatsoever. Gonna keep this one short: Pros: - Great rate! $90 for a 4 person room during Spring Break. Pretty much the best deal on the strip after shitty old Imperial Palace - Very spacious rooms. Good amount of floor space to lay everything out, huge bathroom and showers. Our room came with a 42"" TV, which we didn't use too much but it was nice to have. The beds are pretty typical, but who really cares when you're passed out from a long night of partying? Cons: - The room was a bit outdated. I understand that they're upgrading their rooms, so I guess most rooms will eventually look a lot newer. Not an inconvenience, just something that could be improved. - No free-wifi in the rooms. Not sure if any hotel in Vegas has free wi-fi, but it would've been nice. Overall, a pretty good experience. We weren't looking for anything too fancy and wanted to keep the price low. We got what we paid for and left happy. Thanks Excalibur! ",0,0,0,1,0

 We bought the 24 hour buffet passes here and used it for Sunday brunch. I liked it. There wasn't as much lunch time food as you would usually get at other brunch buffets. It was definitely more breakfast focused. However, I was able to find more than enough food to leave myself full. Our waitress was attentive at continually refilling the champagne glasses and they were handing out mini bottles of vodka to make your own bloody mary. I was nice and tanked by the time I had finished brunch. I can see a lot of people not enjoying this buffet but I go into all buffets the same way. I will find some things I really enjoy and some things I do not enjoy. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've always said I avoid ""fusion"" restaurants. I am a vegetarian and it should be easy to find something anywhere... but with fusion dishes it's nearly impossible to customize or substitute entrees and that creates problems for my diet and (mushroom) allergy. Last night while arriving 45 min. prior to watching ""perks of being a wallflower"" (watch it!) I noticed this place next door. I have been wanting to try ""tapas"" (this was not that style of small plates)... My friend and I stopped in and ordered two individual glasses of sake wine (try the top red option if you dine here! I had the white peach- meh.) I simply ordered dessert which was the banana fritter + ice cream. It was good but nothing spectacular. Ordinary deep fried 'nana, fruit as a garnish, and a scoop of ice cream. Not even really worth the $6. Why didn't I eat any 'real food'? I only noticed one tofu dish listed throughout the whole menu. Not very impressed. And NOT veggie friendly. I've been to other sushi places and usually I can at best find a ramen noodle option. Not the case here. Also, the female server was nice 'n all, she mentioned. . .""Oh if you ever stop here AFTER your movie you can bring your ticket stub and get a discount"" Uh....... cool? Not helping us tonight. We also split the bill. 2 cards. she charged mine twice! How do you mess that up? We weren't even in a rush. As the yelp rating ^ states, ""Meh. I've experienced better."" ",0,1,0,0,0

 My mom wanted to go here for lunch last Friday & I was actually kinda excited, because it's been a few years since I last came here. Parking was a bitch & that was a task in itself! Any way, we made our way back to the hostess stand & was told there would be a 30 minute wait. For lunch, really?! We decided to sit at the bar where there was no wait. Lindsey was our server & she was so sweet, checked on us often too. For starters we ordered the bistro calamari & boom dip. I forgot how big the portions are, what were we thinking ordering 2 apps?! The boom dip was yummy but the calamari was just ok, way too much breading/coating! For our entree we decided to split the 14"" aunt margherita pizza (thin crust) & added artichokes. My mom only had a bite since she ate a lot of the apps, I had a slice & it was ok. Pretty bland in flavor, barely any cheese & the crust had a similar texture to cardboard. I took the leftovers home & my hubby agreed, he wasn't diggin the pizza either. Total (not including tip) was about $40. While the food was just ok the service was great! I'd like to come back & sooner than a few years, because I know I've had good food here in the past. I think next time I need to order some pasta & definitely the pizza cookie! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Okay I want to like this place and only giving two stars is really hard! The sushi was fresh and nice portions and the wildfire and sweet tomato are my new fave rolls.... But.... The service was below average. Felt uncomfortable there. And it didn't help that the guy, who based on other yelpers picks might be the owner was rude! I ordered a Snow White to him, he took my order then walked away. 10 min later I realized he wasn't coming back and didn't tell other chef about my order so I had to order it again. Our rolls were good but based on other yelpers picks who know him, we got short sticked on our presentation... I like the radish noodles with my sushi! Then they don't do half rolls and with all you can eat there are so many limitations. I agree with other yelpers that with all those limitations I can go somewhere else! Only certain appetizers are included in all you can eat, you can only do one each of the rolls with no rice, and because of those rolls I had to pay dinner price at lunch time. I really want to like this place as they had good selection and all. But I didn't feel comfy... When chef gave me attitude when I said most places have a tiger roll and it's good I was like what??? And they weren't very nice to my kid who loves sushi and loves sitting at the bar cause most places make it fun for her! So due to all that I gave two for quality of fish and selection but when I go out I want to enjoy myself! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Neat little sub shop where they slice the meat when it's ordered, as opposed to Jared's big sub chain that the stuff is sliced somewhere else. So the sub I had (turkey and provolone) was fresh tasting on a nice toasty foot long... I mean... a twelve inch long... sub roll. Cut into quarters, which I wasn't expecting but I liked it. They have the usual cold deli meats and the usual toppings, plus what look like some decent hot offerings. It's not outstanding, but it's way better than the usual national chains and so it gets a four star review from me. Soda fountain has Pepsi products and there are two urns of iced tea. Free wifi!

 It was my second visit & possibly better then the first time. Not sure why but I really enjoyed everything. The waiter has been there forever & he has a very quirky personality which made the experience a lot more interesting. The house itself is too cute for words, yes it used to be someone's home. The lighting & French music is absolutely perfect & everything is very charming. The food was great! We did the 5 course menu & come hungry because it's a lot of decadent food. Everything was cooked perfectly & it's a long dinner experience but didn't feel that way. I honestly wanted to just spend the night & explore the grounds. Keep things as they are because we loved the old Vegas/French feel that is what's left of it. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Probably the only restaurant that the service was so terrible that I have left before getting my food. Me and my boyfriend went here with a groupon, that we had purchased specifically for Fujo. They refused to take it, and the manager told us, ""you have two choices, ask for a refund from groupon or just eat here without it."" If we had been rude then I wouldn't be able to blame him, but we had politely and calmly spoke to them and asked about it. We walked out and went to Emzy for sushi instead and it had great service and excellent food. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I'm somewhat a ramen fanatic, having already eaten at most of the Seattle ramen shops. We decided to check this place out since my brother said that this place was amazing (especially since they were a good sport to take care of a group of 20 people haha.) I'm not too big on the overly rich, highly sodium filled broths that I've experienced. I decided to play it safe and went with their shio ramen w/ light sodium. The first bite I had was amazinngggg. So warm, so chicken, so doge. The noodles were perfect in every way. Not too soft and not overly chewy, I can just easily slurp them! :) the pork was really tasty too, it was made so you could easily break it into pieces, or just have it melt in your mouth. Service was excellent, the waitress was attentive and had an adorable personality. My only complaint is the wait time. I hope they get a bigger shop soon! I highly recommend this place to any ramen lovers out there! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Dropped by on a Tuesday night and they were slamming old school hip-hop (no cover). It's right next door to Blue Dog - so you can co-mingle with the dubsteppers there on a Tuesday night or just pop in if you want to spaz out. Anyways - spent the majority of my time here. Dope little bar with a crazy fast bartender. The place was packed and he was the only server working. Cozy booths and plenty of seating around the bar with a little dancefloor in the back. Unpretentious, fun and cheap. You can dance or just drink while listening to some Golden era hip hop. I wish there were more places like this where I'm from. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My first visit here I wasn't impressed. I tried to order white rice, and the waiter couldn't understand me after repeating myself 3 times so he brought me fried rice. It was just okay. However, the second time my boyfriend and I came here we were quite impressed. We walked in at 7:45 PM on a Monday night and the place was empty. We were the only ones there. The waiter this time spoke and understood good English, which was nice, but he was a tad bit awkward. But that's OK. Every meal service starts out with complimentary wonton chips and sweet and sour sauce. We ask for a side of spicy mustard with them. Try it- it makes them taste a lot better! We ordered some crab puffs to start. Six of them come per order for around 5/6 dollars. They are quite small, so the price for the value is just alright. Otherwise, they're pretty good and are not overly cream-cheesy like the ones you'll find at other Chinese places. For dinner I ordered the string bean beef and my boyfriend ordered the orange chicken both with white rice. My string bean beef was exceptional. Not to mention the portion was HUGE (like 2 meals worth and I can eat a lot!) which made the price of around $12 worth it. I'm not a huge fan of orange chicken so I didn't try his, but my boyfriend really seems to like it and he is the pickiest of picky eaters. They also give you a really nice portion of rice which is cooked really well. Altogether, the meal with two drinks came to about $35, which isn't bad considering the portion sizes. Much better than Panda Express value. Perhaps my favorite part of the meal are the complimentary banana desserts that they give you that are wrapped in wonton paper and coated in a crunchy caramel like sauce. SO good! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've eaten at many of Thomas Keller's fine establishments, and this is one I am happy to recommend. Brunch with friends was a memorable experience. The service complimented the food, even though it took a little longer than normal for all the dishes to be delivered to our table. The pastries were incredible and their daily specials were just as equally delicious. I tried the chicken and waffles and the end result was a juicy, moist half chicken served alongside a sourdough trio of waffles with a delicious sauce. This is an item you must try (and share). While the line was somewhat long, they often pass out samples of their pastries so your wait is somehwhat enjoyable. ",0,0,0,1,0

 First of all we missed our reservation time due to Hennessey. Worried that we may not be able to move to a later time, I was pleasantly surprised to receive a later reservation. So of course our party still showed up late to the restaurant still in thanks to said Hennessey. The staff still managed to be very friendly despite our lack of grace and composure (aka Bachelor Party). In fact they locked us in the private room with an equally crazy Bachelor Party also from our hometown (Go Niners). The food itself was good. I had the Crab Dynamite Roll, the Spicy Scallop roll and the Crispy Salmon dinner. None of the above stuck out specifically but the quality and presentation are enjoyable. Drinks blurred into Sake Bombs and shots of Patron. The check was a bit rough but I felt it matched my expectations well. My overall star rating is 3.5 ",0,0,1,0,0

 Call me crazy, but I was expecting this place to have the best darn hushpuppies in town.... I was very mistaken. The hushpuppies were more like corn bread nuggets, nothing like the cornmeal fried delights that I'm used to. They were good... but they were disappointing at the same time. I think they should rename this place ""Mediocre Southern Comfort Food."" Most of the meal choices earn you a trip to their ""salad bar."" Yes.. I put salad bar in quotes because it offered only one choice of lettuce with few veggie toppings, but I will give them credit that they did have a large variety of dressings. Alligator tail: A good appetizer. The breaded deep fried nuggets of gator did not have any distinguishing flavors. I could have been eating fried chicken nuggets and I would not have known the difference. However, the breading did have good seasoning and the nuggets were crispy so that is a plus. The freshwater catfish was thinner and milder in flavor whereas the farm-raised catfish was thicker with a stronger flavor. Both preparations were a big disappointment. The breading was completely bland and the fried fillets weren't crispy. So it was an overall soggy flavorless dish. The only thing that made it palatable was the cocktail sauce that I dipped it in. If you ever had the opportunity to eat at Catfish Alley- this place pales in comparasion. The fried shrimp was a little better, but I could have gotten better fried shrimp from the Red Lobster. Plus side: the catfish/shrimp dishes are AYCE so if you have a large appetite you can eat your weight in fried seafood, but for me and my husband, we left full... but not satisfied. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Stopped in for an early dinner on Saturday evening. I had missed lunch and was starving. I rarely get over to this part of town and it had been well over a year since I had visited. So even though it was only 4:45 PM, I figured I would visit again. So glad I did. Even though it was so early, there were already a few tables filled and the carryout pizza was flying out the door. By the time I left a little after 6:00, the place was pretty full. I was promptly greeted and seated, and quickly attended to by my server Todd. Great guy. Very friendly. His service was stellar. I started with the appetizer special of a large Portobello mushroom cap stuffed with a crab filling and topped with a balsamic reduction and served over a bed of saut \ u00e9ed spinach. Delicious. I followed with a entre special of Osso Bucco (did I spell that right?) with a side of Gnocchi. Again, simply delicious. All in all, a terrific experience. Great food and service, with a comfortable and quaint atmosphere. I'll need to try harder to get over that way more often...... ",0,0,0,0,1

 Hooooooooly smickity smack - Hawthorne's threw it down for us today and I am a fan for life now! This is my second trip to Hawthorne's. Like Candyce B. reviewed, I attended a Yelp event where the service and food was absolutely amazing, but I had to return on a normal day to see if the service and food were of the same quality and they absolutely were. My lunch date and I had an amazing lunch today and I am tempted to go back for dinner to have their special of the day. Visiting at 11:45 on a Sunday for lunch to try and beat the second service church crowd, parking was already a bit of a cluster (I hate compact car parking... seriously... it's the south, most of us drive full size vehicles), but there was ample parking. Other than The Meat House, it seems to be mostly restaurants and offices at The Village at Robinson Farm, so I guess everyone was hungry on this gorgeous Sunday. We arrived to a friendly hostess and were seated immediately. Our super friendly server arrived seconds later to get our drink order and told us about the special of the day - it's St. Paddy's Day, so the special was a Reuben pizza, which we got the 9"" pizza as an appetizer. Oh. My. Dog. So simple, but so delicious. There was no red sauce, just mozzarella, swiss, thinly sliced corned beef, sauerkraut with a small drizzle of thousand island, served on a thin wonderful crust. It was AMAZING, absolutely delicious. The crust was perfectly cooked, thin and crisp without being hard. YUM! I had corned beef and cabbage for dinner last night, this reuben pizza for lunch and I am seriously considering going back for dinner tonight for more of the reuben pizza. This needs to go on the menu full time! I ordered a Philly cheesesteak for lunch, which was nice pieces of beef with cheese and a chipotle mayo served on toasted bread. It was good. My lunch date had the lasagna, which he said was delicious. The meat sauce was full of meat and it looked and smelled really good. We were too full for dessert (4 hours later and I am still stuffed), but I will be trying some dessert on my next dine-in visit. Our server was wonderful. Attentive, kept drinks filled, provided some lunchtime entertainment, he was excellent. Lunch took an hour and a half with waits on the food, which I thought was a bit long, but the food was quite good, the drinks were kept full and the company was great, so no complaints.

 I concur with the reviews that this is a 'hidden gem' among theaters - specifically ""mainstream"" movie theaters, i.e., more likely to be playing a sequel or kids movie. So, you really can't compare it to a Filmbar or Camel-*gag*cough,cough*gag*-view because they don't show major studio-financed movies that get called ""indie"" (as opposed to major studio-financed movies that don't get the hipster designation -- if none of what I just stated makes any sense to you, then you probably don't go to movies that often to care about the diff.) Accordingly, you can't judge Picture Show by Filmbar standards if one theater shows crap - albeit big-bugeted, undeniably entertaining crap - and the other theater shows Cinema with a capital ""C."" Ok? No comparison. However, there is a reasonable criticism to be made vis a vis the concession stand being situated in the lobby, but before the entrance of the theaters. As in: First, you get the tickets - secondly, you get the popcorn and soda - and thirdly, you hand your ticket to the ticket-taker. I don't know why no other Yelp review has pointed this out, but that really isn't the ""norm"" for *any* moving picture exhibitor. There's also a reasonable criticism to be made that their popcorn tastes like it was popped out of a microwaveable bag. It tastes better than AMC's popcorn (constipation alert there), but not as good as Harkin's popcorn. So, be careful about getting a large popcorn: stick with small or medium. I'm in the ""Yay! I'm a fan"" category. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place is a gem. Great space, great views, great service, great food, great prices. We had a wonderful dinner. Started with olives with fresh baked breads and a rocket/parmesan/pine nut salad. Next, my wife had a skirt steak with chips (I think they were cooked in beef drippings...great flavor) and I had a mushroom, prosciutto and pea risotto. We finished with a chocolate/espresso pave and a chocolate pot with poached pear. Our dinner was accompanied by a very nice Montelpuciano (Note: the wine list is dominated by a very good selection of screw cap topped wines, and wine service consists of the bottle being set on your table -- fine by me). Everything was absolutely delicious, and the bill was only 65 pounds.

 I didn't pay for this, it was comp'd. I'm a baller like that. I walked up to the cashier and she said, quite rudely ""you're Katie??????"" I answered with a confident ""I AM."" I guess when you see a 29 yr old girl alone in a buffet line at 9am with a free voucher, it's questionable but I didn't let that deter me. Even the beverages are self serve here. I guess you tip the wait staff for taking away your plates. They at least do that adequately. I wasn't offered champagne and wasn't sure it was an option until the table across from me got a bottle. I would've at least appreciated the choice. Speaking of choice, I really should discuss the food. I had 3 plates and finished with soft serve ice cream. After taking a small bite out of each item, I managed to lose my appetite. My plate-taker-awayer must've been confused at the plates he was taking away as they were all barely touched. There were even ""crab legs"" that weren't memorable. As a fat girl who jumps at the chance for free food, this is not acceptable. I filled up on Diet Pepsi (why is it impossible to get a Diet Coke in Vegas??) coffee, ginger from the sushi bar and melted soft serve. I understand when you put cobbler in the bottom of the bowl, or if the bowl is warm, the ice cream will melt. My bowl was cold and the ice cream was soup by the time I returned to my table. I remember going to the Excalibur buffet as a youngster and my family getting out of line because it was so repulsive looking. It was like that scene in ""Vegas Vacation"" where Cousin Eddie takes them to the buffet. That being said, The Big Belly Buffet is leaps and bounds above that status... but in a city of Wicked Spoons and Bacchanals, your money is best spent elsewhere. Again, it was free. C'est la vie.

 Great food and fantastic staff. Been going there since they opened and love it. Great burgers and chicken sandwiches, if your there on Fridays, the fish fry can't be beat. I am not much of a salad guy, but the Southwest Chicken Salad is more that enough and is great!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 My husband went into Bed Bath & Beyond with one simple goal this evening - buy a new vacuum. He had it all picked out and had his coupon ready. In his words, this was the worst experience he has ever had at a BB&B and ""maybe ever in a retail store."" While I know Yelp encourages people to write about their own personal experiences, my husband does not have a Yelp account and asked me to write this for him. His complaints: 1. The aisles are too narrow to get a cart down. The vacuums were located at the end of a section that was not reachable by cart. A vacuum is a pretty big item that one would need a cart for, so instead he had to carry it down to the end of the aisle. Not a huge deal but still a pain. 2. In addition to the aisles being too narrow, there were ""things"" on the ground and in the way in many of them - display models, etc. It didn't seem as though they were in transition and the items were there temporarily as they moved things around - they were just in the way. 3. When it was time to check out, the two women at the check out were so busy talking to each other that they did not have time to acknowledge that there was a customer. They could see that there was a person in line, but still stood there finishing their own conversation before helping him. 4. There was no pen to sign for a credit card purchase. Silly, but...it's a store. Where people use credit cards all day long. Shouldn't a pen be readily accessible? 5. The entire walkway from the register to the exit was blocked with shopping carts. My husband had to push them all out the way to get out of the store. 6. And finally, after all of this, the check out person forgot to take the security tag off of our new vacuum, so the alarm went off, and he had to wait there until they fixed the situation. He was not pleased. This is a bummer to me, as I have always enjoyed shopping at Bed Bath & Beyond. I can only hope the next time we stop by the store we have a more positive experience, and I can come back and update the review!! :) ",0,1,0,0,0

 Was excited to hear that new ""premium"" outlet stores had opened in Glendale (101 Freeway @ Glendale). We waited for the Black Friday shoppers to go home and get some sleep before venturing the 45 miles from home to check them out. But first, I checked their website to see what their hours were, get directions, etc. I actually thought it was considerate of them to list the Arizona Cardinals ""Game Days"" being they're located right by the University of Phoenix stadium. HOWEVER...we got there to find that THIS game day was not listed (Sun, Nov 25th)! And guess what ~ they were charging $10 to park at the outlets, because those attending the game might park there, taking up all the free parking, and then walk over to the game. Didn't matter that we were there only for the outlet stores. But to make nice, we were given a coupon to redeem at the Service Center for a book of coupons that FAR exceeded the $10 charge to park. B...S... ~ NOT HAPPY AT ALL! And we were later to find out we weren't the only ones! So we track down the Service Center only to find a line of people that had been waiting for 25 minutes to get their wonderful coupon book. After scanning the coupons (of another shopper who was not happy about the parking fee), we found that the coupons were for 15% off a purchase of $100 or more, and not all stores at the outlets were represented. Well, I wasn't impressed by the selection of stores to warrant me EVER going back there. It takes me just about as long to go to the stores at Anthem. Now, I gave this whole situation some thought as I stewed about it for quite a while! First of all, I re-checked their website to make sure I didn't miss something, only to confirm that the day of our visit was not listed as a game day, nor was there anything about a $10 parking fee for that day. But then as I thought more about it, I thought, of course not! They are not going to let people know about the fee because the shopper will not visit that day; only the people attending the game. Thus, they will be losing out on the sales revenue. And then the more I thought about, I thought, ""So, are they going to be charging people to park every time there's an event at the stadium?"" And I have to conclude the answer is YES. So beware outlet shoppers! It's going to be a flip of a coin whether or not you're going to have to pay for parking. BTW...the stores there...not so premium.

 Met up with Rand H and Norm R for lunch here today. We had been talking about going for Mexican food and Rand had been here before and liked it. We got here right at 11am when they opened and all decided to do the buffet. There weren't a lot of food choices - I had a cheese enchilada that was pretty good, a chile relleno that was just okay, some beef fajita meat that was fatty and tough, average rice and beans. Nothing spectacular but not bad. I think if I came here again I'd order off the regular menu and skip the buffet. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I was just writing a review for Triple C and realized I have never written a review for Noda. Personally, this is hands down, my favorite brewery in Charlotte. I am an IPA drinker so maybe I am a little biased as they have an abundance (but never to many in my opinion) of IPA's. I prefer their original nodaryzed myself but also enjoy the Woody and Wilcox, Ghost Hop, and the new Pacific Reign. All are super hoppy and just the way I love them to be. All are higher gravity so be careful. They typically have one of the amazing food trucks of Charlotte in there parking lot too, as well as a grill outside for you to bring your own meats to grill out. ",0,0,0,0,1

 The first time i came it was delicious and had fast service. Second time I went i ordered a breakfast sandwhich without spinach salsa or peppers. Got it to go. It took forever. And it had more mushrooms than anything else. It didnt even have cheese and it came with peppers. I even asked before getting the bag if she had made sure it was no spinach pepper or salsa and she said yes. What a waste of $9. All i can taste is mushroom. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My experience with Penn Avenue Fish Company started off pretty great. My team and I are here on a work assignment in the area. I found this place on Google yesterday, so we all agreed to check it out. The decor was really cute, and even though it was a small restaurant and crowded, we got prompt and attentive service. The waitress brought our food out quickly and it was delicious! We all loved what we had and agreed to come back the next day. Today was a different story. One coworker ordered the black cod chowder, which he really enjoyed. Three of us ordered the salad. One had grilled shrimp, my boss had salmon, and I had the swordfish since she was raving about how great it was the day before. The grilled shrimp salad came out first. After waiting fifteen minutes after that, we tried to get the waitress' attention to find out why the food was taking so long, but she kept flying past us delivering food to people who had come in after us. My boss finally got her attention while she was walking past us. My boss started to ask her about our food, but she rudely cut her off and said, ""not yet"", and kept walking. No explanation, no assurance, no apology, just ""not yet."" We saw another staff member dealing with a problem order, so my boss went to ask her what was happening with our food. She told her that different food takes different amounts of time. (Thanks for the tidbit, Captain Obvious.) My boss explained that we had ordered a salad with fish and that it shouldn't take this long. She went back to check and told us that our food was in the window and it was coming out now. We basically waited over 30 minutes for our salads after the other salad had come out and we had ordered them together. The waitress brought our food, still with no apology for the wait. Our coworkers had long since finished their food and were waiting for us. I had two bites of my salad, which tasted really good. Then I took a bite of my fish. It wasn't really hot for something that just came out and the salmon and my swordfish were burnt on the bottom. I explained to the other staff member about the fish. I told her that I didn't want another one since it took so long in the first place, and wanted my money back. She went to get the manager who turned out to be the rude server who we had already had issues with. I told her that the fish was burnt. She said that it wasn't burnt and that all of their fish is fried all the way through or something to that affect. I think I know the difference between well done and burnt, but whatever. This isn't my first time out of the house. She asked me if I wanted them to fix up another fish and I said no. She said that she would put it in as a priority and I said no. I wanted my money back. It took too long and we needed to get back to work. She came over, put the money on the table and left. We barely saw her. No one apologized. The waitress / manager and the other staff member were rude and condescending. It was clear that customer service was a foreign concept for both women. It would have been okay had there been better communication. It was busy, they are understaffed with there only being one waitress who happens to also be the manager. Mistakes happen and I get it, but to avoid us at first, cut us off when asking a valid question, and then not apologize for what happened says a lot. I would not go back there and I wouldn't recommend it to any one else. It is unfortunate, because the food was awesome yesterday. This place makes my the no-no list.

 After going here for my and my husband's 1 year anniversary, i believe that social house pays people to write good reviews. The $125 we paid for 2 rolls, a few beers, and miso and edamame might not have felt like such a rip off if the amount of fish in our rolls was even detectable. The lemon slices on top of my salmon roll were thicker than the salmon slices on top of the roll. Nasty. Starting to lose faith in yelp. ",1,0,0,0,0

 BAD. Was on vacation and thought I'd stop by. I have tried Sprinkles in Beverly Hills and it was good, not excellent, but good. Have tried Crumbs in Hollywood, and it blew my mind, sooooooo tasty. The girls behind the counter were surly and the one that took my order was really indifferent. I ordered the chocolate marshmallow. What the heck was that? THe cake was so stale it broke apart, like dried playdoh. The frosting tasted like chemicals. And I agree w/ that other view. What do they inject in these things? i was on a sugar high for a good hour and I eat chocolate all the time. My hands were jittery! I threw it away after two bites. What a waste of money and cardboard. This Sprinkles has particularly bad reviews, I wonder if the climate and heat have something to do with the dryness?

 I consider myself fortune to live close enough to Liberty Market that I can visit often. In fact, I've been having breakfast here once a week for almost year. It's a fabulous ritual in my life. This place is just what they say, an unpretentious bistro. The food is amazing made with high quality ingredients that takes a flavor twist on traditional. My favorite breakfast is the demi that I order with a pancake (usually with a seasonal option), 2 scrambled eggs and a sausage link. Add to that a great house cup of coffee and I'm in heaven. I sometimes order the cordatito from the E-61 coffee bar. it's a few sips of heaven if you love spicy coffee. I often stop by for either the burger or pizza of the week for lunch. They are always delicious and sometimes they are intoxicating. My favorite burger is the dragon burger, which adds barbecue and slaw with an asian sauce. I do a little dance when I see it is back on the menu for the week. If you love scones, you need to try their blueberry scone. And try any of their desserts. Oh, and don't forget to try the sweet potato salad--it's amazing, too. In fact, I'm sure that anything you order will be amazing. So what are you waiting for? Get yourself to Liberty Market.

 BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!! To all parents: if you are buying a computer like I did for my college student, you might be buying a factory defect. I bought a top of the line computer for my daughter who goes to UNR and after 6 weeks it stopped working. The geeks squad cannot fix a laptop since they don't have a ""clean room"" they have to send it out for repairs. it will take 3 weeks!!!!! So now I have to buy a new computer because best buy won't stand behind their products and just return it and give her a new one. I don't know about you but I would expect more than 6 weeks of use.

 If I could give no stars, I would. Worst dining experience ever. My fiance and I stood at the hostess' stand for nearly five minutes before the hostess decided to seat us. Then we waited ten minutes for someone to take our drink order. I ordered the roasted lemon herb chicken. When it came, it was visibly incorrect - it had clearly been grilled and smelled like chemicals. When I peeled the skin away, it seemed okay... so I ate a little bit. Then I dug deeper. To my absolute horror, the chicken gushed blood and the looked like jell-o. It was RAW. Of course, my waitress was nowhere to be found, so I found someone else to take it back to the kitchen and grab the manager. Meanwhile, my fiance had a chicken fried steak. It was cold and tough. Ten minutes went by and the manager still hadn't visited the table. Worse yet, our waitress decided it was time to go home... and we weren't assigned another waitress. We had to go find someone ourselves to get the check and have my meal taken off. I hunted down the manager, who was apologetic about the situation, but didn't offer any practical solutions to the situation. She didn't seem to think it was a problem that the waitress had left work without reassigning the table, and she tried to defend the chef who made the chicken. I couldn't believe it. If you are out of something, fine. Let me know and I'll pick something different. Do NOT serve me something you pull out of the freezer and try to cook really, really quickly. You could kill someone that way. I hope I don't get sick. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I finally got to try Tradiciones today. This one has intrigued me for awhile because it is consistently rated as one of the best Mexican places in Phoenix by the Arizona Republic, yet Yelp reviews are mixed. I kind of get that now. First of all, when you walk in they have meat cooking over a wood fire, which is a really nice touch. Even as I write this, I still have a slight campfire smell on my shirt. The d \ u00e9cor is more or less your typical American Disney-like Mexican restaurant ambience, maybe a step above the norm. I was on my lunch at work so I could not drink, but I noticed Dos Equis on tap, which is always a plus in my book. The place is pretty large, so it would be a good destination for a group. Service was very good and friendly. The prices were pretty decent for lunch, at least; I did not see the dinner menu. I had the carne asada platter with chilaquiles ($10.95) and my co-worker had a burro. The food was good. It was not super great, certainly not one of the best in town as AZ Republic suggests, but certainly a step up from Macayos and other chains. I think this would be a good place to impress out-of-town relatives that are not ready for super-authentic Mexican food. I'm not saying there is not authentic stuff on the menu, it's just that there is plenty of the stuff people would be used to seeing at a place like Garcia's. I would almost bump it up to four stars just because of the nice smell, the good service, and most of all, the proximity to the Ranch Market--the most wonderful supermarket chain in Phoenix.

 Find peace and stillness. Sweat buckets. Grow. Nurture mind, body, and spirit. These are the things that I achieve with each practice at Yoga Hive. The teachers are all wonderful people with distinct practices, but all of their practices share a common theme: the practice is rooted in their spirit. When you step on to your mat, you will have a new and different experience with each teacher based on their energy, spirit, and experience. The studio is warm, typically around 85 degrees. With a dozen people in a class, the temperature probably hovers closer to 95 degrees. If you have not experienced heated yoga, I suggest that you try it. The warmth promotes flexibility and produces a wondrous cleansing effect. I have practiced in numerous studios around Pittsburgh, and though there are several standouts, Yoga Hive has become my home.

 I had been tossing it around in my mind whether or not I wanted to review this place. So, I'm just going to do it. I had the take-out beef ribs, collard greens, black eyed peas, sweet potatoes, and the hush puppies. I am really picky about ribs, and you could tell that these were not slow-cooked. They were sort of tough, and not at all how I like them. I didn't care for the sauce much either. The sweet potatoes were good, and so were the greens. Someone stole the black eyed peas from me, so I didn't taste them. The hush puppies were fabulous though. I dunno. I really like ribs, but I would never have them from here again. I don't know if it's worth it to me to go back and try something else. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The staff was very helpful and I relied on them for suggestions since I hardly ever make my way here... They set me up with some delicious lunch, too... I ordered the brisket tacos when I saw them on the screen behind the ordering bar... The tortillas tasted fresh, the brisket was well seasoned and even though I took the tacos to go (and they had a ""superhot"" sauce, grilled onions, cilantro and cheese), they were not all wet and icky which was incredibly impressive... I ordered the hottest sauce they have and it barely had a kick to it in my opinion... Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I was expecting a lot more spice... Candyce B was right, guys... Do not skip the queso... The chips were pretty run of the mill, though... Lastly, the price was a bit high... Over $8 for two tacos, a drink and queso? Maybe I'm crazy, but that's a little steep for lunch... At least for me, so I definitely wouldn't do this frequently, but it hit the spot today... And it's good to know that tasty food is waiting for you whenever you need it... ",0,0,0,1,0

 I don't know how long acme has been an establishment, though I believe they are approaching a decade. That's saying a lot for a Scottsdale bar, though when you actually come here you have to wonder why. There is nothing here that sets this pseudo dive apart from the others. A long bar runs from forward to aft. Booths are squeezed in on the opposite side, and if you are not here during peak hours, you have room to breathe. Otherwise, forget about it. Bartenders and wait staff don't appear knowledgable or engaging, the bar is sticky and smells of college dorm room. Tidbit from the bartender is best night is Tuesday - jam packed with industry folks. Not open on Mondays, their happy hour begins at 5 and goes until 8. $2 domestics, $3 wells, and half off all appetizers and pizzas. It being a grill, the menu is filled with burgers, sandwhiches, and steaks. Apps are the typical dive bar fare...wings, skins, nachos, dips. Probably a good spot for tackling your hangover, not to take a date. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My wife and I used to eat here every Sunday until we got busy doing other things. After about 3 months away, we ate Sunday lunch buffet today. As usual, the buffet was fresh and delicious. The choices were extensive. Now the down side. The restaurant was not quite full and even though we had a waiter that has been there for years, the service was a little slow. Also, the bread served was not the rolls that they had served for years. Instead of an artisan style hard crust roll, these were almost like brown-n-serve rolls. They were not even warm. Definitely out of character for this restaurant. Even the co-owner brother was not the happy person that was enjoyed by many in months and years past. Something was wrong.

 So, how would I end up in Montreal at the Napoli Pizzeria? Who knows really, maybe it was the large gathering of other nerds who were in town to talk to each other about get this (babies, development, and psychopathology). I know right. What the heck does that have to do with traveling all the way to Napoli. Well, it really has nothing to do with that but it really justifies the long trip from New Orleans to here. About the venue, it's cute, small, and has a large tree placed right in the middle of the room. This tree is adorned with glowing grapes that if your lucky are all flickering. The food, I started my night with the french onion soup, and it was unlike any other kind I've ever had. It was slightly sweet but in a different way than most. It wasn't bogged down with cheese like some are so that was nice too. We also ordered a pizza that was delicious and nicely cooked. The pizzas are larger than you would think and if you are with someone else they will split whatever you order on two plates so you even get your own servings! We ordered the medium and we both had two full pieces to take home. So, if you go with someone else you could get away with the small pizza and a salad, or soup or something alike.

 Disappointing experience, especially considering the expectations we had based on others' reviews. The prices are out of line with the quality of the food & service. We had two specialit \ u00e9s du chef: the veal oscar and the caneton bigorade. The veal was overly breaded, dry and tasteless. The duck was good but not great. The bread provided in the basket was low-quality supermarket grade ""French"" bread. The server left a used knife from the salad course for us to re-use with the main course.

But really, this is a 100% geriatric establishment. There should be a social security card machine to make sure you were born before Ronald Regan to get in here. The decor is beat-up 80's - something like a thrift store. The bar is large and mostly deserted. I assume the food is as flavorful as an inner tube - I didn't stay long enough to find out.

 I recently took the Grand Canyon tour around the Christmas holidays. The tour guide was excellent. He was full of fun and interesting facts about AZ. People don't normally think of the desert and think of snow or cold, but North Arizona is quite different than the desert. We first took a short stop in Sedona. Later, we continued north to see snow all around. We traveled through Navajo country. When I finally got to the Grand Canyon, I took the helicopter ride around the canyon. The view was magnificent.

 Totally vegan bakery. Muffins are so-so, but the cookies (especially pecan sandy, peanut butter choc chip, double chocolate walnut) are good. Yes I've tried all the flavors. 98% of the patrons are on computers or working on their own, so it's a good place to work but not the best to socialize. Did you hear me say all-vegan bakery?!

 Awesome food here! This is a highlight of a chain restaurant. The beignets are the best around. (They are only served at this particular Grand Lux). It is a solid choice if you are thinking along the lines of Cheesecake Factory. I love it here. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Excellent food, all the way around. This is the kind of place you expect to have paper towels on your table, and you do, and you'll need them and love that you do. I lived in DC for a few years and there were a lot of pollo a la brasa joints all around there that I became addicted to, and miss. This is very close in flavor, if a different cultural tone. Totally recommend this for an inexpensive, delicious, and low-maintenance meal with close friends. Knowing basic Spanish is probably helpful. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Meh. I was really looking forward to trying out Takamatsu. After all, it is right up the street from our house. Dude and I joined Sarah R. and a large group (15-20, I think, many dropped in and out) here for her Sendoff Dinner. Yes, the quality service tends to decline when larger groups are present. But what we experienced was downright unacceptable. Really rude server. Mumbled and spoke too quietly and we seemed like a giant inconvenience to her. Brought rolls to our table that belonged to no one in our party, and got visibly peeved (eye rolling, dirty looks, etc.) when one of us told her politely it wasn't ours. Good luck getting water or utensils. Dude and I ended up just sharing a glass. Trying to cash out or get a check was a nightmare. Another server approached our party and asked Dude and I if some rolls were ours. They need a better way to keep track of tickets. Got to the point we walked up to the cashier, told him what we ordered and paid. Also, another server on Sarah's end of the table got frustrated with a new guest to our party and RIPPED UP his sushi ordering sheet. In front of customers ... And was that really necessary? We probably made a mistake ordering sushi at a Korean BBQ joint. But hey, sounded tasty! Tried the Las Vegas, Tiger, Rainbow and Heart Attack Rolls. Everything tasted the same. Way too much rice, thinly cut fish (to the point it looked like just the skins), and the breading on the Vegas Roll was bready and soggy. Like it had been sitting out a long time. And don't even get me started on the culinary clusterphuk that was that Heart Attack Roll. Come on: Eel sauce + spicy cheese sauce + cream cheese + jalapeno pepper does not equal a palate pleaser. I did; however, get to taste a piece of Sarah's spicy pork dish ... That was excellent! The bright side to this place? We had a wonderful time enjoying the company of our friends, and Takamatsu was OK with me bringing a cake for Sarah. Despite the dismal experience, I wanted to come back and try the Korean BBQ. That is, until Dude got an epic case of food poisoning. Going on day two. And we're talking about a guy that almost never gets sick. Can count on one hand after nearly 9 years together how many times he's been sick. Not worth $8.95/roll; sure as hell wasn't worth an 18% gratuity charge. I'll stick to Shimogamo for delicious sushi that matches the price, and will be on the hunt for another Korean BBQ place. Spare your digestive tract and avoid the sushi. Stick to BBQ if you go.

 Had Mongolian beef... Which I rarely order because of all the fat on the beef.. Pineapple rice... Mushroom chicken.. Broccoli and chicken.. And shrimp spring roll.. All this shit added up to 57 bucks.. Small portions.. But the shit was alright.. I'd order again, I d just keep the entrees down next time.. But Mongolian beef and broccoli chicken is a must have.. The spring roll bullshit can go.. Like who makes 2 big ass burrito size spring rolls!!!? With 1 shrimp in it.. And the shit was like 6 bucks.. I'll pass.. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was pretty excited (and quite surprised) when two Valeries opened in Edinburgh - I knew them well from Old Compton St and Marylebone High St in London - both long established establishments as I understand. Though normally I would be found in Maison Betaux in Greek Street when in Soho ... I have mainly visited the Rose St branch at which I have taken to stopping at for a coffee and occasional croissant before work. Initial thoughts: - great airy space strongly benefiting from the french doors opening on to Rose Street - which needs all the help it can get (see below!) - early morning views of the street crammed with loading lorries and other traffic not that great on a ""pedestrianised"" street (don't event get me started onCastle Street!) - love the brown and beige vibe which totally reminds me of the main cafe I used to visit when I lived in Austria! - staff have been lovely each time I have been in including when I had forgotten my wallet and was short of cash by \ u00a31! - coffee: great - excellent latte - pretty strong (no flat whites: too modern?!) - I have also had a pretty good croque monsieur and a good chocolate \ u00e9clair. - croissants: ummm, a but disappointing - have tried at least 3 times but none of them tasted that fresh making me wonder if they had been baked some time earlier and delivered or even dated from the day before. Also (and note to all cafes in Edinburgh!) not a great idea to microwave any yeast/pastry-based product as I suspect had been done to my almond croissant! - Also popped into North Bridge branch for an iced coffee (sold out) and some take away cakes - felt pretty overheated and airless although was a hot day; also disappointed at the Black Forest gateuax unfortunately especially having experienced Falkos. Sponge seemed dry, almost mass produced, and no taste of kirsch! Nonetheless, feel they are a very welcome arrival in two streets which need a bit of brightening up and the window displays definitely do that. May be if the comments on here are taken on board they can up their game for 3 stars! My Yelp research tells me that the two London branches I mentioned have better reviews that Edinburgh -so far.

 I'm pretty sure this was the worst restaurant I've ever been to. I know that's quite a charge, but it is well deserved. we were tempted to leave when we arrived and were greeted by an empty restaurant with an overpriced ($21!!) omelette bar. When my son touched the rail next to some stairs his hands came off black! We say down anyway. We ordered some omelettes and French toast and asked if we could substitute anything for the potatoes and toast (we are eating low carb). The waitress offered bacon and fruit instead. the omelettes were poor to mediocre. Bell peppers were used instead of ""green chiles."" The cheese tasted cheap. Definitely not worth $9.50. Any hotel buffet omelette is better. Then we get the bill, they charged us $3 for each bacon substitute ($3 for 2 slices of bacon as a 'substitute'?!) and $3 for each little fruit bowl that had been offered as a substitute! Also, whipped cream was added to my daughter's French toast, a nice touch but something we didn't order and we were charged for that too. So two omelettes and French toast came to $40! After much harassment and lecturing from a very rude manager she agreed to remove the extra charges after I adamantly stated that I would not pay for what I did not order. We left unimpressed with the food, disgusted by the service, and understanding why the restaurant was empty. I don't think we have to worry about them staying in business for very long. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I went for dinner with a group of friends and was super excited for this place. I missed Lisa G's and unfortunately, my expectations exceeded reality. The menu was good and some of the items were somewhat original, but it was the same theme among restaurants serving lunch food for dinner. Central Phoenix seems to be notorious for this and I typically do not mind it most nights but tonight was different. I split the mac and cheese and goat cheese salad with my friend that actually worked out perfect. The food was good, but somewhat bland. Thumbs up for the chili peppers in the mac and cheese to heighten the taste. The goat cheese salad with strawberry was flavorful but the dressing was a bit too sweet for my taste. My other other friends ordered the sandwiches that came with chips and were satisfied with their orders. They have a great beer draft menu and saw a couple of beers that I have not seen in other restaurants, which is a total plus! So the food was good and had a great selection of beer, so why 3 stars? The SERVICE from before I even stepped foot into the restaurant! I called earlier that day to see if they were taking reservations since we had 6 people. She said she wasn't sure if they were and that she would call me back. I never received a call so I called back later that day for a followup. During dinner, there was a consensus that our service was not up to par, and we thought our server had some personal issues going on. After speaking with the waiter, who was very nice once he talked, made it known to us that they were understaffed and was having a busy night. I didn't think it was his fault for his lack of service but thought that management should of hired enough people, especially on a Friday night. I am planning to revisit at a later time when they are more established and I have great hopes for a better experience. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Healthy, nutritious, filling, simple. Because there's the option to create your own bowl, the potential for things to go awry is there. If you don't trust yourself, just order one of the set items on the menu. You can always get a little crazy and sub out proteins for one another. I had quinoa + salmon + kale + pistachios + avocado + and some Asian-y dressing, and it totally hit the spot. Could I have made it myself? Yes, but WOULD I have made it myself is the real question. Overall? grabbagreen is worth the 10 buckaroos if you order shrimp or salmon in your bowl. Otherwise, I'd call it steep, but it's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area and pressed for time.

 The Root is a great, reasonably priced hair salon in Phoenix. The stylists are extremely well trained and very knowledgeable as to their products and trade. The owner is Lauren Hart and I have been going to her for about 12 years now. Every time I leave her salon my hair looks amazing. She has been doing hair for more than 20 years and you can tell. Lauren and her staff continuously go to classes and hair shows to stay up to date on the latest trends and technologies in hair. Everyone that works there does an amazing job and they are all so friendly and upbeat. The decor is very minimal and everything is extremely clean. There is really cool artwork everywhere that is all for sale and changes periodically. The salon is really a place you can go relax and enjoy yourself. I recommend this salon to everyone I know because the staff is very professional, knowledgeable and friendly. I know how hard it is to find someone to do a great job on my hair and I have been fortunate to find this salon. If you are new to the area or just need a new stylist, The Root has what you are looking for. They specialize in color correction and they really do have the client's best interest in mind. They also offer some waxing services, deep conditioning, and they carry a wide variety of products. One tip, call ahead. Because they are so good at what they do, you need to book your appointment in advance, especially if you want to get in with Lauren. Also, they are closed on Sundays. ",0,0,0,0,1

 i am SO disappointed in Reflections, it's in fact very sad. when i first moved into my beautiful apartment (January of 2013), with granite counter-tops and an enormous kitchen i was in heavenly bliss. they were in the process of just finishing up renovations, with a gorgeous pool house, sauna, gym, Jacuzzis...the works, and for the first year and a half i LOVED it here. granted there were some issues of the gates never being fixed, and continuously standing ajar for the whole city to come and go as they please, yet i still felt safe, and the management and workers here were great, always friendly, on the ball, and getting things done when they were needed to be done. then the managerial changes occurred. Jada a good manager, was replaced by Ryan a GREAT manager, some amazing staff members were relocated to other complexes, and other new, albeit competent were brought in, no problem. then they started firing all the great new lease agents, keeping the incompetent ones, and hiring people who barely lasted a month. finally Ryan left, followed by Stephanie and Trinity brought in a slew of rude, incompetent imbeciles who can barely sign their own name without using spell check, and all this for a tremendous hefty height in rent. my lease was up back in August, and personally as much as i love living here, i was worried about being able to afford the rent increase, but i stuck it out and asked them to renew my lease, the lease renewal was unfortunately being done during their new incompetent hires. back in June, when i first requested a lease renewal, i didn't give it a second thought. yet 3 weeks later in the beginning of July, when i have still not received one, i was getting a little anxious, as the buildings policy is, if you do not sign a renewal lease, then you pay a month to month with a penalty of an additional $100.00 per month, which would be added to the rent increase, making the rent of a one bedroom apartment at close to $1000.00 (trust me, far from worth it). after talking to one of the new hires, Courtney, i asked for a lease renewal, she gave me a fake smile, tried to hide her rudeness, didn't bother writing my info down, and said she'll have one ready by the end of the week. needless to say, and to make a long story short due to space, it took them up to up to TWO DAYS before my lease was up, and they STILL didn't have a lease ready for me, it was only with my raising my voice, and raising holy hell that they said they would get right on it. on August the first i STILL didn't hear anything form them, so i called to find out was going on they said, they were waiting for my home insurance info, so i asked if they called the insurance company they said they didn't, so i asked how were they planning to get the insurance info, they said i was supposed to get it to them, i asked if they contacted me for the info, again they said no. so i questioned how were they planning to get info if they never bothered to ask anyone for it? Courtney just gave me a vacant look like she didn't understand what i was even talking about, and said ""i don't know"". that is how their leasing agents ""work"", now lets talk about the grounds. because of the bug infestation here, the pools, and the jacuzzis, when the jets and heat aren't broken, are uninhabitable because i have an issue of doing the breaststroke, with a cockroach doing the backstroke along side of me trying to keep up. the pools and jacuzzis (again when they are working, which in fact is quite rare) are usually filthy with dirt, grime, leaves and bugs...lots and LOTS of bugs. even the main house has an ant infestation in the kitchenette area. they claim they spray weekly, but when you see a parade of ants, all over the coffee machine, you tend to wonder if they are spraying with pesticide or water? the little refrigerator that is to house water for the residents is void of water, but now filled with employee left over lunches, going back who knows how long. the dog fecal matter is lying petrified outside my building, so they can claim that they clean it up every morning all they want, but i don't know of a single dog who has WHITE poo. and don't even get me started on the bird dropping on the stairway, because the area is such a delicatessen for them because of the bugs. the AC in the gym has been broken for ages, and when i told them about it, they said they had someone take a look at it but it was fine (86 degrees is NOT fine). there are fights and arguments in the parking areas, people blast their music from their cars at all hours of the night, there was even a shooting here. this place has gone to holy hell, and i can't wait for my lease to expire, because this time, no matter how much i love my kitchen, the filth and low class of tenants and management that they brought in are far from worth it, especially for the price they charge.

 When fellow friend Richard G. raved and raved about how good Earl of Sandwich is and how he'd eat it any day and everyday, I thought he was just obsessed. I've had other people tell me Earl of Sandwich is good, but that was it, it was just ""good."" I'm a big fan of sandwiches so I was coming into this place with some pretty high expectations. And sure as hell, Earl of Sandwich delivered. I want to say this place ranks in my top 3 (along with Ike's and Mendocino Farms in SF and LA respectively), but where in the top 3, I'm not so sure (I'm so conflicted). But yes, the Full Montagu is a must get! I'm not a fan of mustard, but a;ofhusfo;ahfouef Earl of Sandwich, you did something right if I'm in love with a sandwich that is heavily dosed with mustard. My sandwich was absolutely perfect, love the crunch of the bread and how everything just melts and comes together in your mouth. No doubt, it's an amazing sandwich. They say the line can get long, but came by Saturday afternoon and beat the lunch rush, not a long wait at all. And since it's Vegas, what a steal for such good food on the strip. Open 24/7? Yeah, I'm sold. Going to try the Earl Club next time and their lemonade. And apparently dipping your sandwich in their broccoli and cheese soup makes it super good too. So that'll be the next plan. But yeah, Earl of Sandwich, you definitely earned your name. ",0,0,0,0,1

 When the bread basket arrived filled with hot, flakey, tender, and tasty biscuits, we had high hopes for the rest of our meal. Sadly, they ended up the best part. If you do go, expect a wonderful view of the city lights and a loud, lively environment, but don't come for the food. Biscuits: awesome - they deserve applause. Snake: too tough to chew. (Yes, we tried it.) Salad: swimming in the dressing and tomato was spongey. Potato Skins: cold and strange flavor. Ribs: they were not falling-off-the-bone. The steak knife could barely separate one rib from the other. They were lukewarm with ho-hum flavor. Corn: mushy Green Beans: fine Surprise Cotton Candy: cute and sweet We were looking forward to a great experience, but left feeling like the smell of the steer manure at the entrance should have been a premonition: The food stinks, too!

 Overall, I would not return to this restaurant nor recommend it. Small tables and cramped. The waiter spoke so fast that we had to have him repeat the specials three times. He served us so fast that I got the feeling he really didn't want us there! We felt uncomfortable even asking him questions and pointing out our issues with one of the entrees. I had the veal piccata and it was perfect! The wine was excellent, but our other three guest where extremely dissapointed. The veal chop is much smaller than it used to be. One pasta dish was served very dry and at a cool tmperature. We sent it back. Bread was just ok. Not the amazing kind that you expect in an Italian place. The other dish was just so so. There are so many restaurants to choose from in this area that I won't go back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It just so happened that in one weekend I visit two ""Best of Vegas"" spots, the other being Pho Kim Long. I didn't even do that on purpose. My honey likes pizza! I ordered the chicken calzone. Lately, I've grown more and more in love with calzones. This calzone came out HUGE. The dough rose a lot, making it look like a two story calzone. It looked great, but didn't taste as great as it looked. I loved the guilt free cheese, but not really the taste of the chicken. I wish it had pepperoni instead. And the tomato slices are big. I would have preferred chunks. I got two meals out of this. Although it wasn't fantastic, it wasn't worth throwing away. My fianc \ u00e9e ordered the meat lovers stuffed pizza, which he regretted. You are able to get sauce on the top or the side, but there's no pizza sauce inside. Womp womp womp. Maybe we ordered the wrong things. Or maybe we had higher expectations. Either way we left full. As a note, they have a discount practically every day. And it's different everyday. One day it may be 25% off for military and another for teachers. The day we came in you could receive a discount for wearing tie-dye or a peace sign in honor of Woodstock. That's a pretty cool incentive to get some pizza. ",0,0,1,0,0

 All of the amazing hype is true. Seriously. If you like comedy, burlesque, amazing acrobatics, and ridiculousness, just do yourself a favor and go see this show.

 I love Capriotti's sandwiches, no matter what shop I've gone to the food is pretty much the same. This one in particular is not in a casino and is seriously lacking some fung shui. There is no order counter here, you just walk up to the edge of the kitchen to place your order and to pick it up. If you've never been here it would be easy just to keep walking right into the kitchen. The dinning area is tiny but they have a few tables outside. Last time I went in there I ordered two items, and they wrote them down. Yet somehow they failed to get it correct. Still enjoyed them because it's Cap's and it was still good.

 I went to McFadden's because I was staying at the Hotel across the street, and me and my girlfriend wanted to go somewhere convenient. When we arrived, even though the Blackhawks were playing the Coyotes(in Chicago) in the playoffs, there were about 13 people (tops) in the place...which seemed strange to me. I then noticed that there were only 2 servers and a bartender working. Shouldn't have been too bad given the few people in there...but it was. It took 10 mins for the server to come to our table, another 15 for her to take our drink order and give us a menu then 20 mins to take our order. Once the food came it was decent, but nothing special. Your usual Chilis', applebee's or any other chain restaurant fare. Again, nothing special. The only reason I see that people would go here is because it's close to both stadiums and in the westgate plaza.

 A new BBQ shack offering a variety of different sandwiches, combo plates, ribs, salads wings and more. You can also buy whole ""family sized"" meals and chopped BBQ pork or chicken by the pound. Apparently by the name, the Ribs must be their specialty, though I opted for the smothered pork sandwich which was chopped pork with slaw on a toasted bun(see pics) Out of the 12 different sides I chose mac and cheese. I wasn't impressed with the mac and cheese, it was too processed for my liking but I did like the sandwich, the meat had a nice flavor and the slaw was crisp and refreshing. I would likely return to have that sandwich again. I'm gonna go with 3 stars for now until I have a chance to try some more items, but all in all it was a good experience,service by friendly staff in a clean industrial shack dining area.

 Went here last night to get their 44oz water and a snack before work. When I ordered I was told my total and to pull forward. I was in the drive thru line for OVER 35 MINUTES!!

I replied ""excuse me?"" He sighed and walked off. Finally about 30 minutes after I ordered I asked to speak with the manager, who was polite and the only reason my rating isn't ZERO STARS! I explained I am irritated I have been in line for over a half hour because the machines weren't working and if I ordered something that required that machine why didn't they let me know it might take a while since by this point I am late for work!!

 We made reservations here since we were seeing a concert at the MGM Arena. I highly recommend making reservations online before coming since there were many people waiting to get a table. But that being said, I wouldn't recommend the food. Here it goes... we started off with the pretzel and cheese appetizer. Pretzels good but the cheese was not. Bummer. I had ordered the nachos off of the appetizer menu. Honestly I wish he would have told me how huge this was. I could've been split easily between 4 people. This jicama relish on top was not very good. Spending this much on nachos I was hoping was something tastier. My husband ordered the Champ burger... a $19 burger. Was it worth it? Nope. I had a taste and was disappointed. The service on the other hand was impeccable. There were constantly people coming over to refill our drinks. Our food was out quickly and our waiter was very friendly and professional. $70 later, you would think it would have been a better meal. Bummed. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Kinda hard to add anything new other than notch on the bedpost for Ichiza. I went in with high expectations and there were delightfully surpassed. I was with a group of 5, we ordered a ton of food, beer, and sake, just pointing to items on the wall at random, and the bill was totally reasonable (I think less than $40/person). Everything was fresh, delicious, and exquisitely prepared. The service was so-so, but who cares when your taste buds are dancing the Macarena on your tongue? The Hamachi collar was phenomenal, so was the red snapper carpaccio, and the honey toast. I can't remember everything we ordered, but nothing was disappointing.

Pros: -Desserts here are a MUST -Deep Fried Oreo Sundae -Frozen White Hot Chocolate -Huge seating area Cons: -Hamburgers start at $18 and range to $27, NO THANKS -Wait time is long enough for you to lose your appetite -Take-out window is rarely open -Waitress was only sweet when giving us the check -Only 2 waitresses with 20 tables -Sharing charge of $6!!! When possible, go to the Take-out window, you won't be charged the $6 for sharing a sundae and there is a large seating area outside! ",0,0,1,0,0

 The diner has been nicely remodeled, the it's not to classy yet not to trashy. I really like The D hotel and how they have remodeled and yet still kept classic vegas. The meal we excellent the steak I ordered was prepared to order and to be honest was probably straight from the steakhouse behind it , maybe a shared kitchen? The sides were mash potatos & veggies, the steak was topped w blue cheese crumbles. Salad w dressing and dinner rolls were also included. The wait staff was very attentive and promptly refilled out drinks and brought bill on time. I like that you can use casino vouchers for meals here and also your player card points. The only thing I didn't like was there was no waiting area or paging system, so during busy times it's a mess hanging out in front of the diner. ",0,0,1,0,0

 If it sounds too good to be true it usually is, right? Not in the case of Vegas Club Passes--it's totally legit. I've used their services multiple times in the past few years. It's simple: first go to the site, sign up the number of people going, what days, select the clubs you wish to attend that are available, and you're halfway there. Next, Chris will text you a confirmation the day of (usually late afternoon) confirming that your group is on the guestlist or if any changes need to be made. The great thing is that if you have any questions or concerns you can text him and he responds quickly. Just make sure your group arrives to the clubs before guestlist closes or you've just totally missed the point of the whole thing and end up wasting money on cover. Ladies are usually free for the most part and depending on which club you go to you may get free drinks before midnight. Guys usually just pay half of the usual cover. The only catch for using their services is you have to go to one of the Palms clubs your first night. Moon is okay if you're feeling for more of a lounge atmosphere, I couldn't care less for Ghost Bar, but Rain is definitely the best out of the three and the biggest. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was looking for a Beach Cruiser and didn't want to spend a fortune... I had been looking online and the price for a cruiser plus shipping and handling was pretty much the same as just popping into a bike shop so I thought, what the heck... This location has a pretty good selection... They have several different types of bikes and I saw a lot of mountain/performance bikes... I also found the cruiser that I wanted... It is a nice matte black one... The service was pretty OK here, the guy who was fixing a bike wasn't very helpful even after the repeated eye contact... But the guy who did manage to help me was very nice and friendly, he helped me get the bike and test ride it, as well as throw on the grips that I chose... Oh and the LED light for safety... The final price was very reasonable and I was happy with my purchase... After leaving the store, we thought the bike would miraculously fit into our car and no.... There was no way, so I went back inside and asked the salesman if I could use a wrench so I could take off one of the tires, so it could fit... He said no problem and handed me the proper wrench to make this happen... Long story short, the bike did fit... My cruiser also has a very smooth ride ",0,0,0,1,0

 Updating my review: Still love this place! They are open on Mondays now. The menu has expanded and the prices have slightly increased since they opened, maybe an extra 50 cents. Not a big deal, prices are still very reasonable. The pho broth here is my favorite. It has a great flavor and doesn't taste overwhelmingly salty. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Ill keep this one short. They have a good selection of wine, beer and other booze like products. But I would still recommend going to total wine instead.

 This is my first Yelp review ever. I wasn't ever really interested in writing reviews, but my horrible experience here made me want others to know what I experienced here. Problem #1: My dad and I bought a brand new Civic here a couple weeks ago, agreed on price, APR, monthly payment, length of payment term, etc. with tints & splash guards as part of the deal. They said they would call us within 4 business days to set up an appointment to have them installed. They never called. Problem #2: Kept the car for about 2 weeks, then received a call (finally) asking my dad and I to come in. We walked into the finance manager's office where we were told that our APR was increased because of banks not willing to take the loan on the conditions we agreed on. This is where the problems started. The increased APR would have increased our monthly payments (and overall payment) significantly. We continuously told them that we had a deal that we shook hands and agreed on and that they were not honoring it. What kind of a business is this? This just proves the stereotype of car dealerships of doing shady business practices. As a result, we returned the car that day (since we drove it there) and were driven home by an employee. Problem #3: The finance manager, Jon O'Connell, CURSED at us and THREATENED to take the car and force us to find a ride or WALK home. He also threatened to call the police. The 3 other employees were civil for the most part despite our disagreements with how the way they backtracked on our deal (one of them kicked Jon out after making those threats and remarks at us). If anything, this guy, Jon O'Connell, will be the primary reason why I will never shop here again or recommend friends/family to this dealership. This is a prime example of how dealerships should NOT behave if they want to make a sale. Problem #4: Before we returned the car, another one of the four employees whom we talked to did not hesitate to call the police on us for ""trespassing"" and ""refusing to leave."" What total BS. He even put the phone on speaker as he called in order to intimidate us. At that point, we called the police ourselves and knew we couldn't find a resolution. No more talking at this point. Two officers came, pretty much summed up that unless we find a deal, we couldn't keep the car, so we returned it once they promised to drive us home and returned our down payment. One of the officers even said that they can pull this kind of stuff because they probably have a clause in the contract that says they can. Shady business practice, I tell you. In short, they shouldn't have made the deal with us if they weren't 100% sure they could honor it. They ran our credit scores and made the deal with us based on what they saw and after hours of negotiating (2 days w/ 3+ hours each). In their defense, they claimed that they do not provide the money to finance the cars, but make deals based on a ""best guess"" system, where they make a deal by guessing how much a potential customer can get financed at what rate. They try to make a deal that makes the customer happy and sign a contract, but come back some time later and say ""Nope, we gotta charge you more because we made that deal on a guess and no bank would agree to the terms of that guess."" Total BS. Never shopping for a car here again. Never recommending this place either. How they treated and spoke to us and backtracked on our deal is a prime example of inappropriate and improper business practices. It also proves that its employees are in a dire need of classes in hospitality, customer satisfaction, and making deals that they can honor. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Yeah, two stars and that's all it deserves! Sure the food is really tasty but that is really all Pure Pizza has going for it. Look I get the whole organic/granola/hipster thing everyone is into these days. I like that we are getting back to real foods with real names from real people. But honestly this ""market"" aka ""food court"" is a prepackaged sterile side show! Its located in the heart of downtown Charlotte, and has the typical chalk board menus, old style metal chairs, and hokey 'barn' carts to hold food items. The walls are covered with images of vegetalbles/flowers/smiling people/and all that organic stuff. There are about 10 other shops in there (coffee, sushi, meat, wine, pizza, desserts, etc) and each one is playing on the farm local organic vibe. But come on people this was hand picked by marketing and designers to make you FEEL like your in an old world market/little farm town. And its specifically designed to pull in the younger crowd working in downtown that wants to be a part of that image. Let me get off my soap box and talk about Pure Pizza. I ordered a medium and 3 bottled waters for a total of $24. The cost was a little high, but I thought maybe the pizza would be all that other Yelpers had raved about. I figured that would be more than enough for my wife and toddler to enjoy. Anyway, yes I did enjoy the pizza, but it was more like a small in the realm of pizzas. On top of that these pizzas are thin crust, no not crazy paper thin, but thinner than I was expecting and from seeing it I knew it would not be enough for my family. Regardless though the pizza was super tasty with a great crust and the honey to dip the crust in was a very pleasing. But all it did was make me want like 2 more pizzas! But I was not about to drop almost $75 dollars on a lunch! And how much were those stinking bottled waters!?! They weren't even anything special and actually they were super cheap bottled waters with caps that were annoying to take off. But whatever the pizza although amazing on taste is too expensive for the amount you get. Yeah I know all organic and free range and vegan with no preservatives and high fructose corn syrup is worth the extra coin. But I can't recommend this place because of the cost:food ratio. It's that simple! In addition to the prepackaged 'market' theme that your immersed in... its just to fake for me. There are better values in Charlotte than Pure Pizza. I'd rather go to the Penguin for some true local flavor!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've been here dozens and DOZENS of times over the last 25 years. 5 stars without a doubt. Standouts are the Italian beef with ""lots o hot"". Their cheese fries are absolute perfection... here's why. Put fries in a basket, smother them with cheese sauce, put another hand full of fries in basket, SMOTHER AGAIN WITH CHEESE SAUCE. When you are done with these cheese fries you are looking for more fries for the cheese, not more cheese for the fries. Then, when you walk out, school girls and boys break into song and birds start chirping. Oh, I have to mention the cheese steak. I don't like the standard way they do it (beef, onions, cheese) BUT if you ask for it ""Philly Style"" they do it with their cheese sauce that they add extra cheddar cheese to. Yum yum yum.

 I am hear visiting from CA and needed a wash after a brief downpour, I was directed to Danny's from the concierge and boy was I disappointed. First the guy hounded me to get a ""special"" deal on a detail job that is normally $249.00 and he would get it for me at $199.00 being a salesperson I figured if he was negotiating I would to.. I offered him $125.00 he gave me an attitude and told me he wouldn't do it and he had to move on. I took the normal wash and went to pick up my car...keep in mind it is a black car and the temperature was up around 95 degrees, noted to the dryer guy that it is a bad idea to have a black car straight out of the wash in the direct sun, considering you have a over 100 feet of under roof shade!!!... He told me that they have to move them up to keep the line going...there was ONE other car behind me...besides that they were using DIRTY towels... I would have thought that being that Arizona is one of the cleanest states overall that I have been in the car washes would mirror that care.. NOT!!!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Accidentally found this place. We were totally on the way to the Thai place on the same plaza when Chez Monieux appeared. Cajun food? Hummmm... My friend said he had Thai but have not had Cajun and that sealed the deal. So, we go inside and place is totally empty. I mean no one is there. WOW What the?!? But no matter, we were quickly greeted and seated at the table of our picking. Chit-chat with the guy and turns out they are like super new. Just opened up and not many people even know about them, and today supposedly weirdly slow anyhow. Ok cool, better for us!! We order up 2 platters and it shows up real quick. They even split it for us as we asked, so we can easily try each other orders. And try we did! It was GOOD! I mean, really REALLY good stuff. And it was lots of it. Did i mention it was good? In fact, my buddy could not stop eating it even though her kept on saying -""I can not stuff anything else in!"" But its simply too hard to pull yourself from it. I do not give rave reviews very often, but this is totally one of them. You should absolutely check it out, its worth it. Yes, it might be in the little plaza next to the freeway and ambiance might be all but non-existent. But who cares?!? Go for food. You will not be disappointed!

 I went to this buffet with three other people and none of us liked it. The buffet presentation was great, as stated in pervious reviews. The actual menu was the problem for me. I don't think I was cultured enough to enjoy their offerings. The item that stood out to me the most was the shrimp that still had eyes and legs. The dessert was very mediocre and looked better than it tasted. I spent most of my time walking around the buffet with an empty plate because the food was totally different from what I would normally eat. I'm glad it worked for some, but it's just not for me!

 Solid authentic Chinese food- expect to see lots of families dining together at giant tables heaped with giant portions of fresh food, twirling around on lazy susans. Service is not the most attentive but genuine and polite, food is fresh and great. Menu is extensive and a bit more expensive than you might expect- but the quality is the reason why, hence my use of the word authentic. Also, portions are enormous. Many seafood dishes including sea cucumber, lobster, and crab. Some dim sum-like items on the appetizer menu, including my favorite fried shrimp balls, but here they go for larger portions with a justifiably higher price tag (order of 8 for $13). Getting a few dishes to share family-style is the way to go here: Szechuan scallops are stir fried with onions, bell pepper, and bamboo, and is a great dish here. Another favorite is the barbeque duck, which is available at a well-priced $9 for the half order and is served with an amazing sauce. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Ok... i'm not getting the hype. The problem I had was that with everything good, came something bad. - Menu: huge selection of basic mom-pop italian food. The pizza is definitely the highlight, Problem was that it was too huge, including the goofy oversized menu that hit my partner in the head all the way across the table. -Pricing: pretty good. some things were high, some were low, but all in all i have to say pretty darn good for the portions. -Portions: We had the garlic cheese bread, awesome and HUGE - almost too huge though for an appetizer, to the point where it filled me up too much and i could barely finish my pizza! The pizza, as well, was HUGEEE (we got the chicago style - DO NOT get appetizers if you are getting a chicago style because you WILL NOT finish it, or even come close, be happy with pizza for the next week). On the other hand, we also got the ""zany zitti"" which was... well pathetic. Small and unsatisfying, served in a bread bowl, and i mean cmon how many carbs can one person have??? The flavors were boring as well - not something i would ever recommend, being i've made better at home from a box. -Flavors: Not bad, but not special. not surprising - so in my opinion, therefore not interesting. All in all - if my guy wanted to go back for the good pizza, i'd be ok with it, but its definitely not a place i'd drag my friends to on a good thursday night. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I can't speak for other Yelpers but I have never had too much of a problem with the service. However, I do have to say it has been about six months since I have actually sat down to dine there. When we have in the past, the hostess was always very cordial. As for the servers, it usually averages out each time I had gone - ignored this time, really good service the next time. Most of the time I order the Hong Kong pan fried noodles, some bbq pork or if I am with my mom also some roast pork. Most of the time we also get sauteed Chinese broccoli (yes, I do broccoli if it is of the Chinese variety.) Everything is usually very delicious, very flavorful and not ""Americanized"" at all. Lately, I find that I mostly go here during lunch time to order from their take away counter. It is always their bbq pork and rice. The old man behind the counter is pretty friendly and the young lady who rings up my order is pretty nice as well. For me it's a carnivores delight. So I guess if you don't want to risk the service at least try the counter where you can see them weight your food for the correct price :-) ",0,0,1,0,0

I can't say enough nice things about everyone who works here. I have three vizslas and they're a handful...and have broken things at the store because they get so excited when they're there -- and they still are kind and welcoming to me.

 This was my first time stay at the Rio, so here's the breakdown. Staff: 5/5 Friendly & polite. Room: 3.5/5 It was a conjoined room (suite), and I had the room with the king-sized bed all to myself. The room includes a sectional sofa, tube t.v., a Jack & Jill sink, & a typical shower/bathroom. The reason why I gave it a 3.5, is because the pictures from the t.v. fluctuated between black and white, and then to color. And the floors needed to be vacuumed, or at least underneath the bed. Bed: 5/5 So COMFORTABLE. Not too stiff or too soft, just the right amount of firmness to give you support, yet cradles the body. Extras: 5/5 I love that they give you a mini fridge, that kept my water and left-overs nicely chilled. There's also an ironing board and iron; good for last minute presses. Hairdrier (standard), and a single cup coffee maker (coffee is, of course comes with a fee). Noise level: 4/5 Walls are pretty insulated, however, loud conversations can be heard, though. But overall, outside noise was kept close to none. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Good chips and salsa is about all the positive I have to say about Manuel's on this visit. The food quality was lacking - oversalted and grisley steak, greasy quesadilla my daughter rung out before eating and wilted lettuce strewn about the plates. All of the prices are REALLY high for the quality of the food and it seems like there are NO more affordable options. Even the kids menu is high ($5.50 plus extra for juice) and their emphatic NO SUBSTITUTIONS is frustrating. The happy hour menu looks more promising but for a Family, it's a NO THANK YOU.

 This year, we sold the truck, and bought a slip -- probably the best investment ever. What a pain it was, to load up the boat with coolers, hook up the trailer, tow the boat all the way the lake. All that gas we used. Then we had to wait to put in, and someone would have to park the trailer, like a mile away. Then we had to maneuver the boat to the ramp to pick up that poor soul. Then at the end of the day, do it all in reverse, and when we're tired, hungry, and sunburned. Now it's drive the car to the lake, where the little golf cart whisks us down to the marina. There, we can pick up a cart for our stuff, which is minimal, since we keep the coolers on the boat. Grab some bags of free ice, stroll down to the boat, load up, cast off, and be gone! When we come back, we just tie up again, grab our stuff, and hop on the shuttle back to our car. They even pick up your trash for you, when you leave the bag at the slip. The marina itself has all the conveniences -- a store, gas, a restaurant and bar -- which are open to the public. Sometimes, the restaurant / bar has a band or karaoke. I'm usually too pooped at the end of the day to check it out. But it sounds like fun. Plus, for members, there are also laundry and shower facilities, and a sort of rec room, with a bank of grills you can use. The staff are always friendly and helpful. For us, it's really been worth every penny. We go to the lake a lot more often now, too, since we don't have to deal with all the stress. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Finally got around to going to this BJ's close to my neck of the woods. Would always pass by it on Centennial and see it was near constantly busy with cars. Whaddaya know, we like it! Nice building, very reminiscent of the one on Charleston (my guess is that's the point). Lots of dark wood, intimate lighting in some parts, lots of room at the bar with multiple TV's. Nice flooring and high ceilings too. I like the rotating door at the front entrance, good touch. The night we came it was on a weekend so it was busy at a nice clip. We didn't have to wait long for a table though, maybe about 5 minutes. Aisles are pretty spacious so I had no problem getting to my seat. Our server was courteous and well-mannered, took care of us really well. Even if we weren't first-timers to BJ's he still gave us a nice review of the menu and the specialty types of pizzas they create. Informative, nice. We've been to BJ's before so we had a good idea of what we were ordering. There were four of us in our party and we got: *Piranha Pale Ale Nachos - Topped with BJ's Pale Ale Chili, jack and cheddar cheese, tomatoes, green onions, olives, cilantro, and sour cream. With a side of fire-roasted salsa and extra jalapenos. *BJ's Favorite Signature Deep Dish Pizza (Large 14"") - Meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, olives, onion, and tomatoes. *Baby Back Pork Ribs - Flavored with Big Poppa Smokers' Sweet Money Championship Rub, topped with BJ's Jeremiah Red Ale BBQ sauce, and served with two steak sides of your choice (we opted for steamed veggies and the Wedge Salad). Luckily on this day we had a coupon from Facebook where you buy an entree and get another entree of equal or lesser value FREE. We bought the pizza and got the ribs gratis! Not a bad deal at all. Especially considering a large pizza will set you back between $20 - $25 depending on what kind of pizza you order. The food? Not bad! Definitely reminds you of a Cheesecake Factory type joint. The nachos were good, lots of cheese everywhere, and that fire-roasted salsa had some great flavor. The pizza was good, definitely fits up to being a signature of BJ's. The crust was thick but still light and airy. Nice crunch on the outside with a good chew on the inside. Loaded with good toppings. After two slices I was done! Definitely not a NY pie (which I kinda prefer). The wedge salad was excellent, and would only be that way IF you have a head of very, very fresh Iceberg lettuce. Topped with creamy bleu cheese dressing, bacon bits, and fresh black pepper, it was a good accompaniment. The surprise of the night was the pork ribs! Someone did it right - enough smoke, generous rub, enough sauce (with extra on the side), cooked just right to near-fall-off-the-bone, I couldn't get enough! I finished half the rack myself. With that coupon our meal was a near steal. For the four of us, we managed to get away with an under $50 check (with tax & tip), and leftovers for a midnight snack. I like a value meal! We were too full, but one should try and get a BJ's Famous Pizookie. A warm deep dish cookie, topped with two scoops of cool, creamy ice cream? Yeah you're gonna want one. I'll be back again BJ's, I'll have to try your Happy Hour that goes from 3 PM - 7 PM M-F, or 10 PM - Close Sun-Thur. That looks like some good eats for cheap! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Absolute junk! After less than 1 year their main ion-exchange tank developed a leak and had to be replaced. After 3 years the brine tank developed a leak and leaked brine all over my garage floor. 90 days after having that replaced i went out to replenish the salt. I found the brine tank completely dry and all the salt I had put in it was still there. I called their ""customer service"" and was told I would have to pay yet another $79 to have a technician come out and fix the problem they left when they came out to replace the brine tank. Thanks alot guys!! Now I have to pay again to fix the problem they left. They only have a 30-day warranty on their work--even if it was done in-correctly to begin with. ",1,0,0,0,0

All interior elevator doors // puke and whatever else stained Comforters // badly stained Casino is fun, miracle mile is good, but why stop maintaining your property????

 We had a large party on Saturday night and were promptly seated when at least ten guests arrived. I ordered the Firebird Rotisserie Chicken with potato salad and grilled vegetables on the side. The chicken was perfectly cooked with moist breast and dark meat. We also enjoyed their famous homemade cornbread. My buddies went straight to the red meat, which I looked at with envy. I definitely will return here. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We came here as a bachelorette party posse, after happy hour-ing in our room at the attached hotel, and having dinner at Ling and Louie's. There was no cover, but I believe we got there right at or just before 10p, which might have been why. I was surprised how packed this place (eventually) got. There was a scant crowd at 10ish. Early in the night my vodka/soda was $5, by last call it was $7 - I don't know if I got an unsolicited upgrade in vodka or if prices went up after a certain time. I'm by no means a club person so take the following criticisms for what that's worth, but this place was totally lifeless and utterly forgettable, by way of vibe, d \ u00e9cor and clientele. The crowd was bizarre - at a casino out on the res, that is to be expected. I surmised they were young folk (mid 20s singles looking to hook up, and edging on 30s married couples in groups who all got a babysitter for the night) who probably lived out in Maricopa and this was the closest club to hit up. (Let's face it, it's the closest anything). The layout is terrible. There is zilch seating and the dance floor is small. The only seating offered that isn't reserved tables (that require bottle service) is a padded bench in a raised up area. This area, which is also where most of the small, booth like tables are, has no view of the dance floor. Utterly stupid move. It feels like you're totally separated and closed off from the action. The bar is separated right in the middle by this raised up area, so on one side you stand at normal bar, the other side you are a giant, towering over the bartenders and bending oddly to collect your drink. Weird. The materials, angles and colors of the club made it seem like a cheesy spaceship set. DJ was ok, basic top 40s stuff with a few old jams from Outkast, MJ and Pharcyde thrown in the mix. But there were more than a handful of times he would put a song and the dance floor would just clear the hell out. But instead of get the hint and cut it early, he would ride it out. Bartenders were slow and inefficient. In the end, it was convenient and exactly suited our needs for the event: a bachelorette party. But if I had to get dragged out to a club again (yes, I am usually dragged) I would take a PCL or even a Martini Ranch over this place any day. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My wife absolutely loved her turkey burger, and the fries were decent if not spectacular. So why the 2 star rating? The service was absolutely awful. This was at the South End food truck meet up on Friday night. By the time we got there (8ish) the lines were dying down. My wife ordered from here while I went elsewhere to order. The line was longer where I went so by the time I got back she was already waiting for her food. Then we went to Common Market to pick up a couple of beverages. We came back and my food was just coming out. Hers was nowhere to be seen. It was another half hour before it came out. I was watching the whole time and it wasn't like they were overloaded with orders - it took them between 5-10 minutes to put out each order. Absolutely crazy! My wife liked her burger so much that she said she would eat there again, but it will have to be without me because I won't wait. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Tonight I went to this location. I have been there at least 20 times over the past 2+ years since I travel to Pittsburgh a lot. Some times I have good meals/service and sometimes bad meals but I like being able to get the lunch-sized Chicken Pamesan for dinner. Tonight was a disaster. I ordered my usual lunch chicken parmesan and a small 1893 salad without olives, feta and peppers. 40 minutes later I got my meal with the chicken on top of the spaghetti on top of a lot of oil and a salad with everything with little lettuce. It was the sorriest sight. I complained about the length of time and was told a large party of 35 ordered right before me. I told the manager, Laura, that someone should have told me that I would have to wait a long time. She said the waiter wouldn't know. Obviously the kitchen staff would know. Cmon Tuesday night after 8:30 shouldn't have that wait. Why didn't they bring the salad out first. She had the audacity to not pick-up my $25 meal but offer to pay for a $10.95 entree when I have a $10 coupon. I declined because it was an insult. Walking out I mentioned about the salad being wrong and she said my original waitress didn't communicate correctly to my replacement waiter. Obviously the manager needs training too because she didn't know how to handle a disgruntled guest when her restaurant was at fault. My waiter didn't even bring me out a plate for my salad or the usual bread. I had to beg for a water refill. I told her that I was so upset I couldn't even enjoy my meal. Previous issues that I will add here..... burnt appetizers, burnt food, long time for meals, horrible service, incorrect orders, no silverware for carryout - being told the manager had the utensils locked up in the safe so that's why I had to wait almost 30 minutes for my meal to be wrapped up. So you ask why do I go back. Many times I have had great food and service - Thank you Gina for your service in the past. With too many choices I won't be back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 So my closest 17 relatives and I were going to Vegas and I wanted to try to introduce them to some interesting food that they might not otherwise try. Talking to a group like that is like herding cats! MY GAHHHD!!! It was such a loooooong, painful process! I showed them pictures, menus, prices, and spent hours deciding what to eat for our 3 days in Vegas. While talking about our dining options, I often heard: ""It's expensive!"" ""Buffet! Let's go to a buffet!"" ""That's such a small portion!"" ""Let's go to the Filipino restaurant!"" ""Umm...where else can we go?"" GEEEEZZZZ. I wanted to end my misery so I gave up persuading them to eat somewhere else. PAN SEARED SCALLOPS - Yessss, oh yeeeees...These scallops were perfectly seared, fresh and tasty! The red wine sauce was so good that I actually ate all the brussels sprouts and parsnip pear pasta that came with it. The sauce had a tremendous flavor but it didn't cover up the scallopy flavor! Is ""scallopy"" a word? Well, it should be! Nothing else was as superb as the scallops, though. COMPLIMENTARY BREAD - They gave us so much! Unfortunately it wasn't fresh off the oven. I didn't even mind if it was recycled but at least heat it up! The olive oil/balsamic vinegar it came with was spicy and wasn't good. My family, on the other hand, must've liked it cuz they inhaled most of the bread and the olive oil, maybe because the entrees were taking too long. OSSO BUCCO - This was the special that night but it wasn't that special. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, it was alright but it was thirsty. I was not impressed with the risotto it came with either, it was a little tough. A little more water all around would be great! TIRAMISU - It was decent and that's all I can say about that. PANNA COTTA - Light, silky, creamy, yummy! But it was just like many a panna cotta I've had. SERVICE - Needs improvement! We were the only customers for a while and their service was so slow. Our entrees took about 45 minutes. It got even slower when more people came in. Our waitress was MIA for so long that we asked another waiter for the dessert menu. It took about 15 minutes for everyone to decide what to get and our waitress was still missing when we were ready to order. When we asked for our waitress the waiter replied, ""She's busy."" Uhh...how about us??? We didn't want to be late to the Cirque du Soleil show! So another waiter took our order. We finally saw our waitress again when she served our dessert. I was kind of disappointed that my family chose to eat here cuz there are so many other excellent restaurants in Las Vegas. It wasn't a total bummer because the scallops kicked serious ass, the panna cotta was good, and my family liked their dishes. So in the end I guess I didn't mind so much that we had dinner here, but I don't think I could be convinced to eat here again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Much better than what we were expecting! Doctor checks on patients almost everyday. CNA'S promptly came to every call nicely and were helpful. Rooms were kept clean. Food was good, more variety & has an alternative if you wanted something different. Rooms were a bit outdated & small, but it was comforting to know they really do room checks every hour. However, 2 patients to a room can have its own downsides. You also may have to remind staff to turn them more often to prevent bed sores. PT & OT were good. This place was accommodating for our visiting hours before & after normal visiting hours. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I don't think it would have ever tried its place on my own, because I don think I would have ever found it. I was asked to go for brunch from a friend and fellow yelper, who was going a on vacation for a month (a going away brunch). I did not know what to really expect after looking at the menu online. First let me say that there were 12 of us. We didn't not have a reservation, it's first come first serve. We got seated right away with no wait time. For bunch they offer specials and bottomless bloody Mary's or mimosas. I had to work or I would have been down for the mimosas. I ordered one of the specials, a twist on eggs Benedict. Instead of muffins they had spicy potato patties. To drink I ordered a cappuccino, and let me say it was almost as good as the ones I had in Europe. My food came out hot and looking great. There was so much on the plate. My first bite was so good, I did not want to put my fork down, but I did ( at least a few times to say how good my food really was). Looking around the table the eggs Benedict must ave been really yummy sounding because 6 of the 12 people ordered it. Our waited did a fantastic job in getting overtones order correct and keeping our water and mimosa glasses full. He was very attentive to our group and also his 4 other tables. The price was a bit more then I thought it was going to be but it was well spent after trying the food and the great service. I WILL BE BACK!!! And I will try more yummy foods. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I'm like a chick when it comes to a bad haircut... if it's bad, I'll want to cry, eat chocolate, chinese food, and drink pinot grigio until the pain goes away. But since I'm writing a barber shop review to a bunch of men, I'll focus on the important things here. 1) The haircut is fine. I've never walked out of here with a bad haircut. 2) The TV's have sports on them. 3) The prices are fair for a haircut. 4) I've farted in the chair while getting a haircut, and I think they might be used to it. Nobody said anything. Just a tip for the future... it's okay to fart here while getting your haircut!** 5) For men like myself who use product, they've got a decent selection here. 6) There's a nail salon next door if you really want to pamper yourself. 7) There's a sandwich shop and a sonic next door. Plan your day accordingly. I guess that just about covers it. ** - This never happened, but try it and play a mean trick on your stylist. Let me know how it goes! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Tighten up, Management. Nothing worse than a great idea, a clean facility, and decent to good food ruined by very poor and disappointing service... Breakfast this morning with a large party. Around 20 minutes after ordering, my simple oatmeal had still not arrived, while others who had ordered egg dishes etc were already eating. This was because they had run out of oatmeal. How can you wait twenty minutes after running out to come tell us it will be another ten minutes before more is ready? That is not how a dialed breakfast spot runs. They should have told us in a reasonable time so we could switch our order if we didn't feel like waiting a half hour for a bowl of oatmeal. Getting our drinks was a major challenge, too. Clueless wait staff totally unaware what we had ordered. Please cut this nonsense out already and learn how to execute proper service people. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The Cheesecake Factory is definitely on my list of favorites....Ive never been to this location before and I was in the area so I decided to give it a try. The service was great, our waiter was very attentive, and the food was pretty good although my shrimp was a bit over cooked (I had the shrimp and chicken gumbo)...one thing that really bothered me was how filthy their silverware was (there was pieces of leftover food on my spoon and butter knife). I asked my waiter for an extra set of silverware and cup of hot water to soak them in...problem solved...I don't live in this area so I'm sure I won't be returning to this location ",0,1,0,0,0

 Root 174 is probably my favorite place to eat! I am lucky that this is so close to me. Will the GM is awesome! He is also super friendly, fun to talk to, excited about everything on the menu, and loves mountain bikes. I always feel so welcomed by him. I took my cousin there Saturday night and again it did not disappoint. She loved everything about it. They are definitely farm to table, putting together the freshest ingredients that compliment each bite. We split four apps (brussel sprouts coated with bacon pepper jelly, grilled romaine with cornbread croutons and a chipotle Caesar dressing, bone marrow br \ u00fbl \ u00e9e, and the beets special) all of it incredible. Will was very helpful in pairing a white wine for us to compliment our food choices. We then split the skillet chicken, with mole sauce, grape tomato salsa, and grits. Amazing!!! My cousin follows a gluten free diet and they had no problem making substitutions for her that absolutely did not compromise any of the delicious flavors. I don't eat out that often and when I do I usually end up at Root, because I am never disappointed! ",0,0,0,0,1

 The hotel is great and very nice. It's a very nice La Quinta Inn. The issue is the hotel double charged me for my stay. I spend several hours with the hotel staff and told me stuff. I am not sure if the stuff was true. I have my doubts. I finally dispute my charge with my credit card company as it was not refund. I then had to threaten legal action against this specific hotel including cost of going back to Yuma for the court case. Only after that did they refund the money. It took almost a month for me to get my money back after they double charged me. Please note with my credit card activity, I can tell when the refund was put through on their side and when it posted so I know it was posted afterwards. I have been double charged before by hotels. I understand the mistake, it happens. All the hotels had the charged refund within a day or two of calling, not a month and not having to threaten legal action. I don't known, if I would stay here again. It's nice but I would NEVER GIVE THEM MY CREDIT CARD AGAIN. In all honesty, I am not sure if I would stay at another La Quinta agian. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I would give it a half star if that was possible. The hotel smells like my dearly departed Grandma's house since she smoked Virginia Slims for about 40 years. The entire hotel even the rooms is saturated with cigarette smoke. I'm a smoker and it was making me gag and cough! My sister had the bright idea to stay here on her last trip and tried to get me to stay in her room. I woke up in the middle of the night trying to catch my breath because I felt like I smoked a carton of Pall Malls! I had to leave and go home around 4 a.m. wondering if they have ever cleaned the vents. The next day I went back for more abuse and humored my sister by eating this piss poor excuse of a buffet with her. All 4 in our group had IBS attacks and were literally tripping each other to get to the restroom because we all had projectile diarrhea! I wondered if it was food poisoning or E-Coli that would be responsible for my demise. We all literally had sore stomachs and flaming hot nether regions!

 I really like Joe's and actually went here for my Birthday this year. Let's just start with the real reason I like this place: key lime pie! It is awesome. My boyfriend got the peanut butter pie and one slice could have feed a small family. Back to why you're probably interested in Joe's, the seafood. The Stone Crab is always cold and fresh and the mustard dipping sauce it on point. But do be warned that if you make a late reservation they can and do run out of it. The rest of the menu like King crab legs, seafood platters, steaks and salads are pretty solid offerings as well. Last time I had the Filet oscar- steal topped with crab- and it was really great. I find the prices to be on point for the strip but not overly inflated like most strip steakhouses. If your solo, there is a great bar area where you can dine and Stephanie makes some amazing cocktails at the bar. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The first time I ate here we did the hibachi which is a lot of fun...especially if you have a big group or kids with you. Tonight I went for sushi and it was really good. The spider roll had crab meat in it and of course that paired perfectly with the soft shelled crab, but I've never had it prepared that way. The highlight was a sushi rolled called ""Captain"" that was one of the more delightful rolls I've ever had. It had crispy fried onion rings on top of spicy tuna and some kind of garlic sauce. Serious yum and kudos to the sushi chef who came up with the idea! I will definitely be back. Thanks, Ohjah! ",0,0,0,1,0

 All hype? Honestly the only reason I wanted to come here was cuz I saw it on Man vs Food. If you're a fan of huge portions you might like his place, but I prefer smaller portions with better flavor. Wow, I sound like a food snob, but I don't mean it that way. I just felt the Fried Chicken Benedict had too much going on. And the fried chicken didn't seem to complement the benedict. It just added a heavier element to the already heavy ingredients. We also got a salad and soup which I didn't mind cuz the flavors were there, just in a bigger bowl. I didn't feel that way about the benedict. I don't regret trying this place, but I don't think I'd come back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is a mixed review with the Mystery Mansion Dinner Theater because it is housed in Coco's. I went to Coco's on Friday, August 12 for the Mystery Mansion Bedside Manor dinner the show. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. We were seated at the table furthest from the stage where most of the show took place. I won't even post any of the pictures I wasted time taking because I was always too far away or behind the actors. Not good! I paid extra for the salmon. Big mistake. It was way overcooked, hard and tasted like tuna fish. I had two small bites. I asked my friend how a person can burn broccoli and she answered, ""The same way they burn carrots."" Burned over-steamed vegetables. Really? The tossed salad in the little cup that kept spilling out as I tried to stab a piece of lettuce with my fork.,and part of the overheated, dry baked potato were the only part of the meal I ate. Bummer. Over all the night was a big disappointment for the money paid. The jokes were corny and the accents difficult to understand. Pete Swartz (female)made it bareable.

 I dig Scramble, their breakfast pizzas and french toast are great. The hashbrowns with cheese and bacon is also good, but I really can't get over how slightly pricey they are considering what you get. Pretty much everything is ala carte. There really isn't a complete meal on the menu. The yummy french toast comes alone. Yeah, you get a lot of french toast, but really nearly $7 for just french toast? It should come with a side of bacon or hash browns. After you add a side your breakfast not including a drink is $10. I just think it's a tad high considering I could go most anywhere else and get a complete meal for less. I can't spend $30 on breakfast for me and my husband when A) we aren't getting full on meals and B) if I'm not getting any boozy breakfast drinks. Still, I do enjoy breakfast here. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We originally went to terrible's casino for some cheap dinner now, which was around 10:30 pm, but graveyard specials didn't start til 11pm. So I kinda waited around before deciding to leave my folks and walk down flamingo and see what there was to eat cheap. I was starving haven't eaten since breakfasts. Busted out the yelp app and saw a donuts place nearby. Walked towards the donut shop then changed my mine. Ended up winging it and just walked, passed Roy's and saw 9091. Ok let's do this. Aww closed. Ok what else was there, I didn't want to walk back without anything. Walked some more towards jack in a box, didn't really want to settle for them and hoped there was something on the way. A message place, a pizza place looked like they were closed, a nice dressed restaurant skipped it i was in shorts and slippers, walked a little more then turned around to see if the pizza place was open. Ahh Verona Pizza, a girl was cleaning the floors, chairs were up, has to be closed nope they were open. A relief, saw the $3.99 for 2 slices of cheese pizza and a soda and got it after checking out the menu. Sat outside, enjoyed the full moon, cool night, pizza slices and soda, fast and friendly service. Pizza was very good, made like NY style but with a better tasting dough, thinner crispy edible crust, light and not oily or greasy which helps a lot because it wasn't a sloppy and saggy mess. The owner or at least what looked like the owner seemed cool too he spotted me the tax cause I only had $4 cash and my card. The rest of their menu was looked pretty good and at a good price, definitely coming back. 12 wings and a soda for around 6 bucks. My night here wasn't actually over with the food, it is again Vegas on a Saturday night. During my meal, a guy asked me to use my phone, no problem looked like a local boy from Hawaii probs UNLV student who was stressing cause his friends left um there. Hawaii people can usually spot each other out and always show that aloha when needed. But if he wen dig wit my phone, my slippaz was off and ready fo run lol. Later on there was a customer who walked out of Verona swinging his carry-out pizza box in all kinds of direction and the owner looking guy ran out and nicely scolded him and told him that he was gonna mess his pizza up, probably first time having a pizza in a box lol. Also when I was about done there a guy who was walking back and forth, in and out of Verona, across the parking lot, who I thought was a regular customer waiting for pizza. But then he stood by the entrances 10 feet from me, quiatly speaking to himself, then went all out talking to himself swing his arms, shaking his pocket filled with coins, sounded like he was bragging about how much coins he had. I dunno I was already done and bailed. Pretty good night so far enjoyed my pizza and energized myself. Lol sounds more like a Facebook update then a review but I figured share my experience. Add they have sitting indoors and outdoots. And a big menu that includes, pizzas, salads, calzones/stromboli, sandwiches, and more. Open til 2am Fri and Sat, 12 am Sun-Thurs. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ate at Flavors for breakfast and lunch recently while visiting Las Vegas. In years past, I enjoyed this buffet, but no more after two tries. Breakfast: A complete rip-off at $18. The $5 breakfast buffet (with card) at Palace Station had more tastier selections. While everything I had was meh to mediocre, the bacon stood out as being particularly bad. It was served in a bin in bits and crumbly pieces instead of strips. The waitress never came over to serve us our drinks - I had to get the manager, Lunch: Again, at $24 a complete rip-off for very limited selections and an almost non-existent salad bar. None of the food is what one would consider premium, and was on par (if not as good) as a Golden Corral buffet. Belileve me, if you must eat a buffet on the Strip or near Strip with similar or slightly higher prices, you will do much better at Le Village in Paris, Spice Market in Planet Hollywood, or Carnival World in Rio.

 As someone from the south, the Las Vegas BBQ scene has always been a source of disappointment. Most BBQ places are comically bad, both in terms of the meat itself and oftentimes more so in terms of the sides. So I went to the Road Kill Grill with pretty low expectations. My expectations were greatly exceeded- the food here is definitely passable and I think this place more than earns its ""best vegas BBQ"" reputation. Before I get to the pros let me explain quickly why I took off two stars: 1. Only outdoor seating. In Vegas. Let me tell you something about the average BBQ eater- they are fat people. When its 100 degrees outside they go into hibernation like a grizzly bear. They don't want to sit outside when eating their BBQ. 2. The service was pretty slow. There were only 3 people in front of me when I got in line and getting the food still took about 25 minutes. I don't mind a wait, especially when the food is good, but this delay was clearly due to under staffing/inexperience as all the food was ready it just needed to be dished out more efficiently. The design of their service line leaves much to be desired- a little rearranging so that more than 1 person could get involved and this problem would be instantly solved/service would speed up 10x. The food I got a 3 meat plate. The highlight was definitely the sausage in BBQ sauce which was very flavorful. The ribs were definitely a little on the dry side but still quite good for Vegas. The brisket sits in a vat of liquid so it was moist but a little tough/needed to be slow cooked longer. The mac and cheese was very decent but the baked beans were way to vinegary for my taste. I will definitely be going back, although maybe in winter, and checking out the butcher products as well. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I am a general contractor and have had dealings with many tile/flooring companies in San Diego and the metro Phx area. I went to Imperial after hearing an ad on the radio. I wanted tile for a bathroom I am remodeling in my own home. After 2 visits I landed on a 12x24 silver vein cut travertine. I was told it was in CA (no surprise all tile comes from the Long Beach ports). I was told more than once thatthey get 2-3 trucks a week from CA and that I would have my tile in 2 maybe 3 days. Well, I am on day 13 now. Multiple calls from me, none from them. I have heard some lame excuses so far and was told Weds it would be finally be here Fri, then Fri that they needed to log it in Sat and now Sat that it was not on the truck. Well, just refund my 100% payment already and I will go somewhere else. Thanks for a wasted 2 weeks. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Very disappointed with the drive through. While the fish was too greasy and the fries were limp, when we got home five minutes later, there were no forks or napkins or tartar sauce or ketchup. What's up with that? I won't be back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I've always thought of Zia records as so-so but was never too fond of the customer service. I have come along a few employees that were friendly but most of them are big-headed and arrogant. Yesterday I went to this location and was literally shooed out by a very ill-mannered girl with short, blonde hair. Under the circumstances I understand she was doing her job but she was VERY rude about it while I did nothing to disrespect her in anyway whatsoever. She decided to be EXTREMELY disrespectful to me over something that I did not do. Working in retail I know that I would personally NEVER EVER treat a customer the way she treating me regardless of what the circumstances were. I have never experienced such rude manner from an employee before and I hope that I never have to again. Needless to say, there is a handful of record stores around the valley with cheaper selection and friendly, helpful customer service. ",0,1,0,0,0

 On our second time eating at Tom Yum we had a very disappointing experience. It was about 5:45 and the restaurant was not busy. There were 3 of us ordering. My husband got has meal first. After a long wait my mother got her food. My husband was over half way done with his meal before my meal was brought to the table. When I looked at it I thought it did not seem to be what I ordered. It was loaded with bean sprouts and my meal was supposed to have broccoli and no bean sprouts.. I looked at the menu and was sure it was wrong. When we told the waitress she said they must have mixed up the order and would cook the right dish. So I sat and waited again. We were charged for my meal even though the other 2 diners at my table were finished before my food ever came. I noticed at other tables people received their meals at different times too.. The whole experience was very poorly handled by the kitchen and servers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Love whole foods! The store has a great selection of fresh, healthy food. I always go in to get a kale salad. This store offers several different ready to go food departments that make it convenient for grabbing lunch, dinner or a snack. I recommend that everyone try whole foods. Don't let the prices scare you, you're paying for quality and its your body that you're fueling. Why not eat good and fresh! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Can't believe I never reviewed this--I've been going to Cha Cha since 2004, with a year-long break when I was out of town. When I got back after my absence, I was very disappointed to discover that Janet was gone, but I couldn't be happier with Gen doing my hair! I keep my hair in various shades of hot pink, red, and orange, with a fairly funky/spiky style, but Gen also cuts the hair of two other grad students of my acquaintance who are much more conservative in their hair choices, and she makes them look great, too. She's very good about giving people what THEY want, whatever that might be, but she also always has input of her own to pin down a vague idea I might have into something that looks awesome on my actual head. Seriously, I think the worst thing about actually graduating and leaving Madison will be having to find someone to replace Gen. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This restaurant was always packed with people since it opened, so I was excited when I got a chance to try out their food. I went with a couple of my friends on a weekend at night during peak hour, so I expected it to be pretty busy. First off, I love love love the atmosphere. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant, and I loved how it mixed the old-traditional pub look with a more modern touch. I also found the little window in to the kitchen area very entertaining. It was a bit loud when we were there but that's because it was a Saturday night, so it was to be expected. The food was great! They were HUGE portions, so I do suggest that you share your food if you typically can't finish things that you order. Most of their food are burgers and fries, but they do have different options like steaks, fish & chips, lobster rolls, etc. Also they have unique touches to their burgers/sandwiches like the peanut butter crunch burger. I got the bacon cheeseburger and it was absolutely amazing. The saltiness of the bacon was nicely balanced with the perfectly seasoned meat patty. It wasn't too salty or too seasoned. I also got the Mac & Cheese as side with my burger, and it was so creamy and delicious! Loved it! Before that we got the stuffed devil's eggs for appetizers. It was light and creamy, but I only wish they gave us more! The dessert was my F.A.V.O.R.I.T.E part. We ordered a chocolate cake and a lemon sponge cake, both were amazing! Each cake, or rather each dessert, came with a little mini milk shake that complimented whatever dessert you got, so the chocolate cake came with a chocolate shake and the lemon sponge cake came with like a light lemon-y shake. I thought that was absolutely cute and unique, and for the price I think it's worth it. (If you're a chocolate or heavy sweet addict like me, I recommend the chocolate cake!) The prices weren't too bad, for a casual restaurant on the strip at a hotel. The price range is from $8 to $47($47 being the highest on the menu). Their burgers & entrees ranged from $15 to $32. The steaks are the most expensive: ranging from $32 to $47, but like I said the portion sizes are huge so you can share. As for the service, it was PERFECT. My friend had a different experience, but I think she just overreacted to things. I mean it was pretty busy when we came, and we were very demanding. We asked for napkins, straws, ranch dressing, separate spoons for desserts, etc. We kept ordering things at different times, but the staff was amazing. They were friendly and got everything we asked for. They were very attentive to our needs. The reason I rated this down a star is because I wished they would've asked me how I wanted my burger. I thought it'd come out rare like it usually does, but it came out medium-rare, so I wished they would've asked me before I ordered it. Also each of my friends had different types of fries, for instance I hand regular french fries, another one of us had potato wedges, another one had something totally different. I wished they would've asked us what kind of fries we wanted or at least indicted what type of fries our entrees came with on the menu. One last thing is that the fish & chips cost like $24, but you only get like 3 pieces of fish & a whole basket full of potatoes, so that was a bit disappointing, but other than that my whole experience was fantastic. This is a great restaurant if you want to hang out with friends, relax, and grab a burger and chill! My recommendations would be to definitely try the desserts and get the Mac & Cheese as a side!

 I've been in Charlotte for almost a month now, and have only experienced one great disappointment: that there are only two dim sum restaurants in the entirety, AND that they're both half an hour away from me. Why, Dim Sum? Why? Now it seems besides the Dragon Court (which doesn't seem to be wowing people either), the Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant is all I have left. Le sigh. Alright, lament aside and review on, this place did not dress to impress. Outside looked pretty sketch, and upon walking in there, the cook and what looked like the manager were sitting down watching tv. They seemed to be able to afford the down time because there wasn't a soul in the house. I waited awkwardly by the counter, then said, ""Excuse me,"" three times to no avail. Then suddenly, for some reason, the chef looked up, barked something and a waitress came out with my order. First things first: if you are a full-time Dim Sum restaurant, you need to have some staples that come with availability. All sweet items are done ONLY on weekends. This includes the custard tarts, coconut rolls, fried pineapple rolls, ANYTHING that resembles a dessert, and one of the biggest staples of dim sum and one of my personal favorites, zha leung cheung fun, also known as Chinese fried dough wrapped in rice noodle. I know how this may sound, but for those of you who have experienced a good zha leung cheung fun, you know what I'm talkin'bout. That taken off my order, I almost decided to wait for the weekend, BUT I was only 15 out of the thirty minutes away in a car with no air conditioning - I may as well tough the damn thing out. Also up on the list: pork and shrimp dumplings, fried shrimp balls, and chicken feet. This is my usual dim sum test. Something I like and is easy (dumplings), something I hadn't tried before (shrimp balls), and... the feet. You can always tell how good a dim sum place is going to be by their chicken feet. In this case, the chicken feet were cooked moderately well, but had no seasoning whatsoever and what little sauce there was was very bland. The meat in the dumplings tasted good, but had an odd texture of not ground, but pureed. It took me a couple to get used to it. The shrimp balls were huge, and delicious. However, the outside was soggy instead of the crunchy I was hoping for. All in all, hoping for a better dim sum experience. Now all I can do is place my hope in the Dragon Court. Wish me luck.

 Bar Roma seems to be a safe bet - its the default Italian restaurant for when a last minute decision about a meal has been made and everywhere else is booked. There is an extensive menu, comprising of all the Itallian meals you could ever think of, and once you've ordered, food is often on your table within 15 minutes. The food is good - if sometimes on the bland and a bit on the boring side. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, the staff are very friendly, and great with younger childern. It's the type of place where one after meal coffee can turn into 3 latte's and a long conversation. It's a nice place, if a bit of a back-up plan, rather than a wow-factor type of place. ",0,0,1,0,0

 One of the worst dining experience of my entire life. We were a group of 4 people with a reservation at 930pm, called in a month in advance. We arrive there at 915, and the hostess tells us that we're early and to wait outside. She says that she will come get us when our table is ready. So we go outside and wait. 9:30pm passes and 9:45pm comes, and we're wondering if she forgot about us. So I go inside and ask if our table is ready, and the hostess says 5 more minutes, they are clearing our table. Knowing that this is a busy restaurant, I give them some room and return outside to wait. During that time, other groups of 4 people who arrive after us are getting seated. I go back to talk to the hostess and ask what's going on, and she replies that these people arrived before us so they had priority??? So you're telling us we're early when we arrive at 9:15pm, then tell us that people who arrive after us are getting priority??? By that time, we just wanted to leave, but because we heard so many great things about au Pied de Cochon, we decided that we wanted to try the food anyways. So by that time, its around 9:55pm and we're still waiting outside. The hostess comes back outside and says that unfortunately our table is still not ready because the current occupants ""just started dessert"". WHY DID YOU TELL US at 9:45pm that our table was getting cleared and would be ready in 5 minutes?? She apologized and gave us free beers, which we really didn't care about. We were hungry and wanted to eat. Also because we had beers in our hands, we had to wait inside in the hallway, which is super tiny with lots of people trying to get in and out. While standing in the hall, I get to see the reservation list and see that all people who had a reservation at 930p had been crossed out( which means seated) except us, and people from 10pm had been crossed out too. What is going on here? We finally get seated at 10:15pm (a whole 45 minutes after our reservation), and we're all mad and starving. The waitress comes and finally gets our order, and we finally think that our troubles will be over, and that we're ready to drink and eat. One of the waiter brings over a plate of cod fritters that one of us ordered, and clumsily drops 2 fritters on the table while trying to set the plate down. Instead of offering to replace them, he simply mumbles ""Oh sorry"" then leaves. EXCUSE ME? Is this real? One of my friend is livid and starts to yell, and our original waitress comes by and asks if everything's all right. My friend explains to her what happened and she offers to replace them at free of charge ( a big 6$ in comped food right there). Also, when she took our order, one of us ordered a pale ale and she completely forgets about it. We had to remind her, and she says nobody ordered it from her. After telling her again that we ordered it, she says: oh yeah I forgot and then brings the beer 20 minutes after it was ordered. Is this serious? They finally bring us the food: Appetizer Foie gras poutine: Awesome. I can see why au pied de cochon became famous because of this plate. The fries are perfectly cooked, the cheese is chewy and tasty, the sauce is incredibly flavorful, and the foie gras just adds to the richness of the plate (For some reason, they brought us bread after we finished the poutine. I thought bread was supposed to be served at the beginning of the meal...) Main dishes: Foie gras hamburger: Very average. The foie gras itself is bigger than the meat patty which isn't that big to begin with, and overpowers the entire burger Duck in a can: Good, but doesn't come close to being as good as advertised. There's an overload of cabbage in the dish, and the duck meat is undercooked Magret de canard: Bland, nothing special. Friend who took this commented on the lack of any flavors. Pieds de cochon with foie gras: Mixture of fatty pieces of pig feet with sauce. There is no way anybody could take more than 4 bites of this without being sick of the richness of this dish. After we finished our meal, we were all fed up with this experience. We just paid and left with a very bitter taste. Overall, I was very disappoointed with Au pied de cochon. Having driven all the way from Philadelphia to Montreal, and having heard many great things about this restaurant from food critics to friends and family, I had very high expectations for this. The horrible customer service just overpowers any potential to have an acceptable dining experience here. The food is ok. I understand the concept of this restaurant which is fat/richness/heavy food on top of fat/richness/heavy food, but there are so many better options out there in a great foodie city like Montreal. I will NEVER EVER come back here again ",1,0,0,0,0

 First, the pros: * They take reservations * There is convenient valet parking ($5, plus tip) * The shrimp in garlic sauce is quite nice * Our server recommended a $40 bottle of red wine that was quite nice And the cons? * Paella: bland * Lobster: thoroughly overcooked, tough, rubbery * Starter salad: uninspired * Potato chips as a standard side: bland, unsalted, meh * Service: very, very strange. One gentleman insisted on rolling his r's in an exaggerated way (""look how very Spanish I am!""), as my friends and I fought to keep straight faces. Halfway through the evening, he forgot to keep up the pretense and used normal r's. Another gentleman seemed scattered; he asked the same questions (""Did you like the sangria? Do you want red wine or white?"") multiple times. * Tables: We were in one of the three ""rooms"" that the restaurant has. The tables were placed so close together that we watched servers bump into each other. And yet, the front of the house was totally empty--no one at the bar or at the tables. One bottle of wine, three entr \ u00e9es and one soup cost us $145 before tip. We left $30 (20%) and headed out. We will not be back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I don't get it? Why the five stars? Being from NY I know pizza. This is not great pizza. Is it because it is so fast? There is nothing wrong with the place but nothing to write home about either. I think of this place as the McDonalds of pizza. They advertise fast and it is. I got a Mini Tristan and a salad and a drink and it cost 11 dollars. I don't know. That is not a cheap lunch for leaving hungry and fast food pizza. I did notice on the way out they had these cool looking Ice Teas and Lemonade. I was intrigued by the sound of a Caramel Pear Tea and the Blackberry Lemonade. They were both Delish. I would go back just for those if I was close by. Another annoyance, the place was dirty. It looked like it had been three months since they dusted the railings where the tables are connected to. ( They have been open for three months) I have to admit the staff members were very friendly. This strip mall has a lot of great options so not sure it will last. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I work close to this restaurant, so I was really hoping for awesome service. I mean, it'd be awesome if I had good sushi close to work, yeah? No. I walked and in placed my order (deep fried California, eel roll, Japanese lasagna) and was told it'd be about 30 minutes before my food was ready. I said sure, though I didn't understand why if only three tables had people. I returned 35 minutes later and was told the food was not done and would be a few more minutes. I was upset because I was kind of in a hurry, but decided to wait it out. 15 minutes later, out came my food. I asked the lady for extra ginger, and she said to me ""No, you don't. Thanks!"" FOR REAL. I took my order with me to work and decided I would judge based on the taste and quality of the food. I was pleased to find one of the containers had a ton of ginger, so that was good. That made me less unhappy. The food itself was mediocre at best, though the eel was good. Sucky food, bad service, and $32? No, thanks. ",0,1,0,0,0

I prepare to have the food thrown in my lap and arrive at the window. The lady just sticks her hand out of the window. I guess she want my debit card. I hand it to her. Nothing. She says nothing! Hands me the food. I ask if she had included Ranch (for my chicken nuggets). ""No, I don't think so"". Well CAN I EFFING HAVE SOME RANCH...Puhlease!!!?!

 Sure , go ahead and take the plunge into this dive near the corner of Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd. The pizza is more New York style, good/solid, above average for sure. Pleanty of people realy love their pizza. Their 2 slice special is a killer deal at 4 bucks with a soda. Here's what blew me a way though...an earlier yelper had mentioned the lasagna. Hmmm...I had never even considered ordering anything other than pizza here. We all know lasagna in a restaurant can be VERY hit and miss. The lasagna here rocks! 3 square slabs were heaved into my round to go tin, it weighed a ton, can easily feed 2, a little not so great garlic bread, strap on a very well seasoned sausage, plenty of cheese, and sauce...BAM $7.25. Sure the place is kind of dingy inside, not filthy, not spotless. If good and cheap, or delivery/to go is your thing, this is the place. Service has always been friendly every time I have been there. It took a San Diego yelper, via a Downtown Cocktail Room mixologist, to turn this local yelper onto the lasagna here. What a world. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Serendipity is having an appointment at my nearby optometrist and discovering that the new Rice Trax location is open! I'm a huge fan of Rice Trax, so I couldn't pass it up. The food is just as good as I remember. I ordered the Mochiko Bento. Obviously, it comes with Mochiko Chicken and adds two Teriyaki Beef skewers, two Chicken Katsu skewers, and a couple of Shrimp Tempura. This is all served on a bed of rice with some salad on the side. It's always too much food and I had enough willpower this time to only eat about half of the bento. No longer tucked at the back of an obscure shopping complex, the new location is much easier to find. It's right by DQ on the southwest corner of Rainbow and Robindale. The interior is bright and welcoming. The employees are friendly. This is all great news. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I don't really eat Mexican food that often. I mean, I like it and all, but it's not my favorite. So, to be fair, maybe this is the way that ""good"" Mexican food is supposed to taste, and my taste buds have been corrupted by the likes of Filiberto's. Anyway, my daily errands found me out in the far West Valley and hungry. While driving, we happened to hear an ad for Arriba's touting their $1.99 chimichangas, and (un)lucky for us, it happened to be a Thursday and there was an Arriba's nearby. *sigh* We were seated immediately, which was good, but the waitress was immediately annoyed with us when we only ordered water with lemon. That's what I always order when I eat out, just to save empty calories. My friend wanted coffee, but we didn't think the coffee in a virtually deserted Mexican restaurant would be any good. When the waitress came back with our drinks, we asked her about the $1.99 chimichangas. We wanted to know how big they were, because for the price, we figured they would be on the smaller side, so we needed to know if we should order one or two. With an exasperated sigh she said ""it's, like, a regular chimi."" We told her that we had never been to this restaurant before, so we needed to know what that meant. Again, she just said, ""it's the size of a regular chimi."" *bites tongue* We asked her what was in it and she told us that they were filled with beef and topped with either red sauce (hot) or green sauce (not hot). Even though I like a little spice to my food, I ordered the green sauce because I thought that even if it wasn't ""hot,"" it would still be flavorful. Besides, as with Thai food, I like to start out by ordering mild versions of the dishes, that way I know how the restaurant calibrates their spiciness meter and I'm not left with a dish that I can't eat, or at least won't enjoy. While we were waiting for our lunch, we were noshing on chips. We had two options of dip: a medium salsa and a bean dip. The medium salsa was all right. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good, either. It was just all right. The bean dip was a little iffy. The waitress told us that they make it fresh there at the restaurant, but the dip had an aftertaste to me, like, beans that had been fermenting in the pot too long and were on the verge of spoiling. You know what I'm talking about? Like, kinda sour-ish. Ugh. I'm making myself a little sick just thinking about it. Anyway, my chimichanga with a side of rice arrived. My first impression was, ""Okay, this chimichanga is larger than I expected,"" and, ""Why is the rice brown?"" Let me tell you about this grossness that they actually have the cajones to market as a ""chimichanga."" First, it seemed like one huge tortilla that was wrapped around a little bit of... stuff... like, four times. The outside was a light brown color, but it wasn't fried. The other layers of the tortilla tasted like they were steamed, or something. Ooh! I know! It was like when you nuke leftover Mexican food and the microwave leaves the tortillas kinda soppy and slimy - from the steam or whatever. I can't be the only person who has experienced this, right? Anyway, ick. Now, onto the ""beef."" I have never seen anything like it! The chimichanga did have something in it that could possibly pass for a meat-like substance, but it wasn't like any beef I had ever seen or tasted. The outer edge of the meat was browned like you'd expect beef to be, but the interior portion was WHITE! It wasn't pork and it had the texture of chicken. *shudder* Not that it matters at this point, but the green sauce had absolutely no taste. I didn't know that ""mild"" = bland. I'm sure this doesn't come as a surprise, but the rice wasn't good, either. First, it was hard, and second, the only flavor it had was of black pepper. The only thing edible was the tiny bit of shredded lettuce and the five pieces of diced tomato that they used to garnish the plate. Maybe it's me; maybe my palate lacks sophistication. I did, however, bring the food home to feed my dogs and they didn't eat it, either. Seriously. Just sayin'. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Great little family restaurant! Very clean, superb service, and the food is very tasty. Not greasy and always hot (temperature). Loved the angel blossoms (crab rangoon). The hot and sour soup had some fire to it, and the fried rice (not greasy) was a meal in itself. We ordered the family dinner and took as much food home as we ate. A very good value. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I looove place Milton! Very relaxed ambiance and friendly service. The order are always super quick to arrive and the portions generous. We used to go to Cora on Park, Place Milton replaced it. More classic then Cora, it serves 'traditionnal breakfasts'. I totally recomand this place if you are looking for an easy spot for hard week-end mornings! The only downside to this place is that it is not spotless clean. The also have a nice terrace in the back to enjoy your breakfast in an intimate outside spot. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The moment I stepped inside, I fell in love. Granted, I was a bit scared. I am a complete foreigner to the east side, but this place made my trip COMPLETELY WORTH ITTT! Sorry for the caps, I just love this place that much. It's a bummer, I don't live close by. First of all, I love that they are strong supporters/advocates of fair trade. Second of all, I'm not sure if it's always like this but when I first stepped in, it was DEAD QUIET. Luckily, I loved it since I had some studying to do! A great place to chat but a even greater place to get work done! The ambience is intimate with a hint of hipster. (: I ordered the creme brulee latte with stevia, almond milk, and sugar-free syrups. DELICIOUS! It tasted like a good ol' creme brulee latte with a deeper taste of almond milk (my fave). As I sat to get work done, I later got hungry & thirstier and ordered the vegan alien burrito with the veganaise (vegan mayonnaise) on the side. It was perfect: fresh, clean, AVOCADO-EY, crispy, delicious! The iced peach tea I got was also a great way to cool off in the suffocatingly horrible Vegas weather! I would absolutely recommend this place to everyone. The only thing that I would have preferred is for them to expand the space a little! When I entered, there was almost nowhere to sit down! Will definitely frequent this place as much as possible before going back to school! ",0,0,0,0,1

 My friend loves South Coast Hotel and Casino because she wins here! She plays the penny slot machines and wins hundreds of dollars on them! (Hundreds of dollars on a penny machine! My gawd!) She got a handy coupon booklet from them when she signed up for their card (I think). We decided to take advantage of their Buy One Get One Free Buffet coupon for lunch on a Saturday. There's nothing particularly fancy about this buffet like the big hotels on the strip. It's a newer hotel though and it's buffet is decent. And with these prices, it's a better deal than going out to eat. Why the two star then? Well, I was eating this one dessert dish and had a weird feeling about it. I told my friend, if I'm in the bathroom in less than half an hour, it's because of this dessert. Well...lo and behold, less than fifteen minutes from leaving that restaurant, I had to find the ladies' room. Yep, my lunch was making an exit! Overall, everything else was fine. Service was standard and the food was okay. But when one little item gets you running for the toilet, it's never fun. Blah! Breakfast (Monday - Saturday): 7am - 10am $6.45 Lunch (Monday - Saturday): 11am - 3pm $7.45 Dinner (Sunday - Thursday): 4pm - 9pm $12.95 Dinner (Friday & Saturday): 4pm - 10pm $12.95 Brunch (Sunday): 8am - 3pm $11.95 Monday Steak Night: 4pm - 9pm $13.95 Wednesday Seafood Night: 4pm - 9pm $16.95 Updated! 07/30/07 - I went here a couple of weeks ago on a Friday night. They were offering 50% off the buffet with your movie stub, and we had just returned from watching Transformers. It's seafood night, so the price was about $16.95/pp, but what a steal when you get half off. The BF was craving some snow crab legs and I noted oysters on the half shell. We both gorged on those two alone, and maybe with some shrimp, and when we did finally check out what else they offered, it was sad to see that there really wasn't much else. They were out of spoons, bowls, etc., and it didn't matter where you checked on the buffet line, they just didn't have any! Even the soft serve machine was breaking down when I was there. Overall, there's not much going on in this buffet. Yes, there's a line to be seated, but I think it's because everyone had a coupon of some sort too. (And can you really complain when your buffet meal is less than $9/pp?) ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place was HORRIBLE. Right off the bat, we were greeted with a not that friendly waitress. After ordering we waited a tad to long considering it was hardly busy. My boyfriend ordered a twenty dollar steak. First big mistake, he ordered it medium and or was easily well done. Not just a little overdone, it was completely well done. I ordered the pulled pork. When she brought me a plate of pulled pork meat, I realized I made the mistake of not saying I wanted the sandwich, which I personally think I would specify if I was the waitress, but I apologize and ask for a bun. She proceeds to charge me two more dollars for the sandwich when I don't even have all the other toppings that come with it. Now when I go to taste my pulled pork, it's cold. Completely cold around the outside so I have to send it back. Upon eating it it was pretty good. The waitress brings is our check not bothering to wait and see of we need anything. After leaving, not even twenty minutes later my stomach was severely upset. I had to take pepto twice to stop the pain. Biggest mistake and waste of money. Now I see why the place was dead on a Saturday. ",1,0,0,0,0

 No question one of the best hotels if not the best in Vegas. I'm sure the MO is great in other cities also. It stands out so much more so in Vegas given that it avoids the smoke filled casinos and associated crazy patrons that they attract. Checkin was a breeze as was the valet area. It made me appreciate how much more relaxing the lobby checkin MO was when we saw the hoards lining up at MGM and other hotels on the strip. Service is impeccable. Pool is fantastic. The fitness facilities are nice with free yoga and fitness classes. Mary Jane runs a particularly energy intensive yoga class versus a more meditative one offered by the other instructor Susan on the weekend. Mozen Bistro is pretty good but you will pay a bit for enjoying a smoke free dining experience. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've been to this Italian place twice so far - and both times I was highly impressed with the quality of food and very helpful service. Our waitress recommended a fantastic wine, priced until $40. I had the stuffed shrimp mushrooms - which were out of this world. As you see from the other reviews, the bread and pesto are delicious, and it's hard to not spoil your appetite with them! There were 4 large stuffed (spinach, crab) mushrooms with a huge shrimp on top. For the main course I had the Osso Bucco - which is braised pork (cooked 6 hours) and a side of homemade gnocchi. The pork was incredibly tender. I can't wait to go back!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Pesto Prima is my new neighborhood go-to for casual breakfast, lunch, coffee and general relaxation. Don't let the location fool you - the strip mall at the SE corner of Hayden and Roosevelt is indeed the right place - and awesome food and customer service awaits! I love eating there because: 1) Nathan, the owner, and his staff are so incredibly friendly, welcoming, and helpful to all of their guests...They provide helpful recommendations and happily accommodate finicky customer requests (including my boyfriend who likes an absurd amount of caramel in some sickeningly sweet ""coffee"" beverage he orders.) They don't serve their customers, they take care of them. 2) The food is fresh, no fuss, and simply delicious. They make pretty much everything. The turkey or chicken in your tasty sandwich? They roast it themselves. The pesto aioli and hummus, the tuna, potato and pasta salads? Yup, they make those too. The Pesto crew takes pride in their food and it shows. 3) The unpretentious vibe. If you've grown weary of the Scottsdale brunch / lunch scene, Pesto is the perfect alternative. The decor is no frills, bright and spotless. There are old peeps, young peeps, guys in suits, nerds, blue collar workers, cool dudes in flip flops, lost tourists from the UK...everyone is welcome here. And customers actually acknowledge one another! With free wifi and good tunes played at a respectful volume, Pesto's a low-key place to get away from the crowd, hunker down and get some work done too. 4) The prices are beyond reasonable. And now they deliver - lounge lizards rejoice!!! The selfish me wants to keep Pesto a secret, but they deserve the good word to spread. So beat the crowd and enjoy before the throngs converge....I'll see you there! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I just left this place and I'm a frequent customer here for the past 3 years. Never going back. Now I've learned the pricing for anything other than standard mani/pedi are very MISLEADING! Had a full set of hard gel done and charged $65.00 ($20 for gel polish/$40 for full set/$5 for glitter fade). Came for a fill tonight ($25) and didn't get the gel polish to avoid paying the additional $20 fee. I opted for the glitter fade only which cost an additional $5. NOPE. They charged me $50, saying the glitter fade is $20. Mind you this the exact same women i saw 2 1/2 weeks ago. I feel tricked. Her argument was she gave me the polish free last time, the glitter fade has always been $20 and the extra $5 at that time was for her labor. Very misleading and mediocre work for $50! Tiffany is gone btw as well as Jenni, who was excellent. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Great location, great suites, great conference center! Location: Located right on the strip, The Venetian is centrally located to popular destinations such as the Wynn/Encore, Treasure Island, Fashion Mall, Caesars Palace and more! You won't run out of any activities and with the shops at the Palazzo you may not even need to leave the confines of the hotel for shopping, dining or entertainment. Suites: All the rooms at the Venetian are full sized suites. That means separate living/bedroom area and huge bathroom complete with marble fittings. A basic suite has 3 flat screen TV's (one for the living room, one for the bedroom and one for the bathroom...so no need to worry about fighting over the remote control! Depending on the location of your suite the views are impressive! Conference Center: The Venetian holds one of the largest conventions centers on the strip. Overall it's a great event space. My one only gripe is at times the air can get stuffy and dry with a weird perfume scent throughout the entire building. Overall the Venetian is a great place to get your party or your conference on in Vegas. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Amazing Italian food. Their bolognese sauce is great and unique at the same time with its smokey and meaty flavor. My wife hates lasagna but has fallen in love with there's.

 On a cold winter day, ramen is exactly what my body and soul needed. Republic ramen had the perfect combo of diverse ramen options and boba tea. The atmosphere is casual, and the red lighting casts a cool glow on your food. Was not a huge fan of the gyoza. Good filling but the exterior was so fried and crunchy it was like a taco shell. For ramen, we ordered a traditional tonkotsu and original Tokyo style, both with pork. The Tokyo was slightly spicy with a wonderful broth flavor. As for the ""original"" toppings, fresh spinach was nice but the carrot was a bit distracting. The tonkotsu had a heavy, salty broth with rich flavor. The ""traditional"" had delicious sweet bamboo shoots. The best part was both came with a vey generous serving of pork, much more than I'm used to, and all for under $10. Simply, beautiful. I was feeling kinda sick that day, and not saying their ramen cures sickness... but the broth did warm me up and I felt significantly better after the meal! ",0,0,0,1,0

 This was my first Cirque Du Soleil show so I didn't really had any expectations coming in. I was just ready to experience! Right away, when entering the show, you are given a sneak preview of what it might be like. The people scanning your tickets are all dressed up in costumes. As you enter into the auditorium you are immediately in awe of the amazing structures/stage set up thing going on. I felt like I was entering like a Final Fantasy video games! It was beautiful and got me really excited for the show. As you are sitting in your seats waiting for the show to begin, the actor's/actress/people part of the show walk out on the outer stage thing doing some acrobatic tricks, spinning upside down and running around trying to scare people. It's pretty fun and really draws/connects the audience I think. Just a couple minutes before the show begins they do a staged reminder that cellphones and photography is not allowed during the show. The show starts off and it is absolutely amazing. The moving stage, the athleticism of everyone in the production, and the music blows you away. The production and performance of the show was just out of this world. However the story slowly kinda got lost towards the middle part and I was really confused on the ending. I had no idea how everything was resolved. I know this was the revised ending since the tragic accident but I wish they had made a better ending of it. My friends and I was so confused that we had to wiki it!! My boyfriend loved the show though cause he didn't really care for the story. If you enjoy an amazing performance than you would probably enjoy this. But if you kinda care about the story well, probably should not get your hopes up. Just enjoy it for the performances. I would come back and watch it again IF they fixed the ending. I just watched the youtube ending of the climatic battle that they removed and wish they kept it or modified the new ending better.

 Okay-maybe i stayed in the old tower because all the pictures on here do not look like the place I stayed at. I'm reading these reviews and I see i should have asked to stay in the newer part of the hotel. Maybe they reserve the crap rooms for people that use the travel sites (like me). I reserved via Expedia and pre-paid, i was asked upon checking in if i wanted to upgrade to a junior suite for an extra $25 a night. I thought it was a fantastic deal so did it. I just got home and checked my credit card statement and found out it wasn't a great deal, the Palms charged me the base cost (which i already paid) plus the upgrade fee. They are in the process of refunding the $200. I got to my ""non-smoking"" room and it stunk. The room was really dated and the television was just like my tv from college that i just got rid of. Old style big clunky television that was all static. My white comforter had a suspicious blue stain all over it... I will say the bathroom was decent-except for the leaky shower head. The entire old tower stinks like smoke and rattles all night because of the clubs, i was on the tenth floor and woke up at four and the tower was shaking from the music (i had been at another club drinking all night, so it must have been loud to wake me out of that alcohol sleep). The food court that is located in the casino is decent and there is a movie theater that i wanted to check out. The casino is way off the strip, so it's about $10-15 for a cab. I ended up mooching off my friends and staying in their fancy room at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, which was not stinky and where I will be staying next time I'm in Vegas. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Had a horrible experience here with a group of 9 people. The waiter mistakenly added a roll that we did not order. We let him know that we did not request that item and he indicated that it would be no problem. At the end of the night we were surprised to find the roll still present on our bill (of over $300). We were even more surprised when the manager refused to remove the item from our bill. Furthermore, the manager would not even come out and speak with us about the decision or offer an apology. We were very disappointed by the service, and we would not recommend this establishment based on how we were treated. ",1,0,0,0,0

 So I came here with my friend over the weekend. After looking at their menu, I proceeded to ask if they were affiliated with Sumo Sushi and the waitress said yes. The environment was lovely and just love all the bench seating. The service was great until after we got our desserts. No refilling of water and they weren't anywhere to be found. The food was okay, nothing great. They made their rolls really weird is all I can say. For instance, philly roll, instead of putting everything inside the roll like its suppose to be, the salmon was on top and it just made it taste a bit off. Their poke tasted pretty horrible. It didn't seem like nice big chunk of smooth tuna, instead it was grainy like. The hand roll was just filled with rice, just way too much. Overall, I didn't enjoy myself. I definitely would not be coming back at all. I prefer Sumo Sushi I/II instead. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I will always be hard-pressed to understand why Pizza Hut in Canada is twice the price of its US counterpart. Even more questionable - this location doesn't deliver to Cote St. Luc even though it's on the cusp of the neighborhood - go figure! No amount of begging, pleading and willingness to compensate will urge the manager or staff to trek the extra mile.... REALLY?! Food's decent, the wait can be long, the service can suck, it's a toss up. I've had a really lousy server experience here once, it was extremely disappointing - waitress pretty much told me and my friend (both of us girls) that two pizzas would be too much food for us - RUDE and made a comment about how we almost came close to finishing them both off - EVEN MORE RUDE... then took 30 minutes to bring the bill. I spoke with the manager who neither apologized nor made any effort to resolve the issue. Charming. Anyhow, I stick to take out and avoid dining in because of this experience... the take out line is slow and like I mentioned previously - they don't deliver to my hood. Thankfully, I moved to the US and get Pizza Hut for half the price WITH delivery. SCORE! ",0,0,1,0,0

 This is what a swank downtown lounge should be: Excellent service even on a busy Saturday night. Martinis made perfectly. Cheerful accommodation of special requests. Suitably swank architecture and decor (and patrons). I'm very glad I finally made it down to sample Hanny's, which was for years a men's clothing store, not a department store as some seem to believe. I brought along a party of international colleagues who were hooked on Merc Bar from a prior visit. I wanted them to try something new. As we approached the entrance and opened the door, there was a collective sigh bordering on a gasp. This was exactly what the doctor ordered. I'll hold back on the final star until I have a chance to sample their food, but I still recommend it to anyone looking for a swank experience in downtown Phoenix. ",0,0,0,1,0

 There used to be an Earl close to where I lived in Michigan.. but one day when I went for my favorite tuna melt in the world, it was gone, just like that. And since that day some 2 years ago, I have been pretty down. But then, while tipsily walking through Planet Hollywood, I saw it. I saw the shrine of all things holy.... EARL OF SANDWICH! The friends I was with walked in unassumingly, not that interested, and refusing to believe my ranting. But then again, my mouth may have been watering so much that I may not have been speaking properly. Once we all go out sandwiches though-- they became believers. The Earl makes a damn good sandwich. This place goes way beyond all other chain sandwich shops in the country, I can't wait for the day that The Earl conquers all. It is rightfully deserved. Trust me, if you want a sandwich. Go here. Hands down, no questions about it. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Macedo's is a promising restaurant offering salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. I came here for lunch a few times and found that while the sandwiches were tasty, but a little pricey. I've had the Cuban and the Reuben. One of the times I ate here I was hoping to get the paprikash (I haven't had this dish in years!) but sadly, they were out of it that day. The Cuban was the better of the two, with tender pork, ham, pickles, and mustard. While it would have been nice to have a pressed, crisp sandwich bread, the buttered roll it was on was good. The Reuben was OK, but a little greasy. The prices for both were $8.50, and included a small side (Potato salad or coleslaw). Fountain drinks were $1.75 and are Coke-based. Service was friendly, and the sandwiches were made quickly. It wasn't too busy when we were here for lunch, so it's a good place for you to sit and chat without getting overwhelmed by tons of people. As for pricing, knocking the prices down a dollar or two would give me more incentive to eat here. ",0,0,1,0,0

I put my order in two hours early, got the confirmation e-mail, and was ready to go at the appointed hour. Five minutes passed, and no cab. Then five more, so I called and was told that a cab had not yet picked up the job. Ten minutes later I called again and got the same information. Twenty minutes later I got a text stating that a cab was a mile away. Since this would have given us just over 15 minutes to get to the station, I said thanks but no thanks, and missed my bus.

 I found Tiffany's on Yelp when staying at the Las Vegas Hilton just off the strip. It was a breakfast place close by with some decent reviews so I thought I would check it out. It's a local place with many regulars. We felt a little out of place as they kept looking at us. The service was very good as the waitress was friendly and kept checking in to ensure out coffee was always full and our food was satisfactory. The food was just ok. I had the pork chop and eggs, which came with home style hash browns. The chops was not marinated nor was there any salt and pepper added, just grilled, and the eggs were bland. The hash browns was very salty, I could tell they used seasoned salt. Perhaps I'm just spoiled with Starbucks, but the coffee was pretty weak. I'll stick to the hotel grill next time. ",0,0,1,0,0

 For the area, this restaurant is amazing. It is hard to find quality food on the border of North Las Vegas.

 This is the most fantastically delicious Mexican food I have ever had. We started out with a fish ceviche followed by a shrimp ceviche. My daughter had a sea bass grilled and my son ordered a chille relleno. My wife ordered a carne asada fajita. Then we ordered a Molcajete Caliente for 2. This comes in a stone bowl with green sauce and cheese. It has shrimps, fish, carne asada and chicken. All hung on the hot stone bowl like a shrimp coctail!! Needless to say we all were eating each others food!! It hits your taste buds from every direction!! Yum!! We thought we would finish the meal with a flaan. How wrong we were! We just had to order another one. It was so delicious. The quantity is right up there with the quality. We had to pack up the left overs to go. There is no way I was going to let one ounce of this feast go waste. The service was exceptional. Our hostess/server was there like a genie. Water glasses were filled before they got empty, hot tortias appeared by magic, lime when requested materialised. Even when we awkwardly spilled a glass of water, it was soaked dry with a smile.

 When I first heard I was going to the Shiloh Grill, I had images of men led by Ulysses S. Grant with Grizzly Adams beards chomping into hardtack along the Tennessee River. Post visit, I can confidently report that the Shiloh Grill seems to be an easy going hangout where locals might go to enjoy friendly service and decent food. So leave your Enfields at camp. I'm sure even you will be welcome here. The restaurant is only a short walk from the Monongahela incline, so it should be on the radar of tourists who are taking in the view of Pittsburgh from atop Mt. Washington. The menu is a cleverly written culinary compendium full of local references interspersed with lascivious overtones. But it's all in a SpongeBob SquarePants kind of way, so relax. The building is of the type that belongs among popular seaside destinations. Wood shingles, an upraised deck and an inviting bar were all reminiscent of time well spent on Cape Cod. And as a New Englander, it struck me as a tad out of place, but it still seems to work - unlike the fireplaces, which are totally for show. There's supposedly an element of the supernatural entwined in the building's history, but I'll let the natives speak to the veracity of Pittsburgh's ghostly lore. My GF and I arrived at the Shiloh Grill about an hour before a family reunion of sorts. Like good bar flies, we spent the hour at the watering hole, chatting with our amiable bartender, who was not only a discerning beer enthusiast, but was also skilled in the fine art of mixology. We were seated upstairs as the appointed hour neared. And since we had spent our afternoon shopping, among the wares we brought into the restaurant were a few bottles of Bordeaux. Well, maybe more than a few. When we were seated, our waiter charged us a nominal cork fee, so we were able to enjoy our own vino and were not beholden to the limited wine menu. Now onto the food. Did I eat healthy? Hardly. That's not possible in Pittsburgh. My Salad de la Burgh came with fries and veritable mountains of shredded provolone and mozzarella cheeses. It also came with marinated chicken tenders, which were cooked just right and retained ample flavor. So overall, I was very satisfied. A great location, friendly staff and tasty food urge me to give the Shiloh Grill 5 stars, but the lack of a skyline view (come on, it's Mt. Washington!) and the sheer concentration of competitors offering comparable food in more scenic locales compel me to make deductions. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Waited 30 minutes to be seated on a Saturday night, which wasnt too bad. Ordered Hell's Kitchen burger, Chanterelle burger, and truffle parmesan fries. Burgers were okay. Nothing too special. The fries tasted like garlic fries served at San Francisco Giants baseball games. Good experience but wouldnt come back again based on the prices. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have had the worst customer service experience in this store too many times to not sign up for YELP and warn others. The optometrist is nice but the staff up front have absolutely no customer service skills whatsoever. The first time I went into the store to pick up something that was previously paid for, they did not acknowledge me for 48 minutes. (Yes I times it!) When they finally asked me if they could help I was very irritated. I had to wait becuase my son really needed to see. I talked with the cashier about how they need to let customers walking in know that they will be with them as soon as possible as three customers after me had walked in and ended up leaving because nobdy acknowledged the fact they were even there. The woman just gave me a dirty look and rang me up and did not say thank you at all or apologize for the bad service. The next contact refill, I figured maybe they were just having a bad day so next time it will be better. It was worse! We waited 52 minutes before someone rang us up and once again the staff was unfriendly. They lost about a $1000 per year account with us. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We stopped in for dinner at the bar and were pretty underwhelmed. It's an off the beaten path location, but seems to be a favorite of locals which I don't really understand. There are much better food options in the area. It seems like a much older crowd and the food was pretty blah. I had the halibut on orzo and fish was overcooked and the orzo was so oily. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Went to Montreal for the day and wanted to seek out the two best things Quebec has to offer (other than beer and hockey) smoked meat sandwiches and poutine. Narrowed down my selections to Schwartz's for a sangy and La Banquise for poutine. After downing the most delectible smoked meat sandwich ever at schwartzs, we headed over the La Banquise to pile some gravy and cheese curds on top of it! Although poutine isn't very complex, I wasn't all that impressed with La Banquise. They have a huge menu, with all kinds of adaptations on traditional poutine, we stuck to the traditional. It was average, but I was a little disappointed after all the reviews I had read. Although I think anything would have been sub par after Schwartz's. Be sure to bring cash if you do have a Canadian credit card (not even my TD Bank (Toronto Dominion) card would work). ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was expecting to be giving Joey's Pizza more stars, but based on my husband and I going out of our way to ""try something different"" - that different did not turn out so great. I've had this place bookmarked because of the good reviews and proximity to my home. There's not a lot on the East Side worth going out of your way for, but some things are really diamonds in the rough. Joey's is not. Ordered three medium pizzas for $21.99 for take-out. The girl on the phone took my order and repeated it back to me. 1 Pizza with hamburger topping 1 Pizza with ham and mushrooms 1 Pizza with pepperoni and jalepenos We got two pizzas correct and the other came as a HAWAIIAN pizza. They put pineapples and ham instead of ham and mushrooms. Okay, it's an honest mistake, but I've ordered this type of pizza from Marco's, Domino's, Metro, Pizza Hut, and Little Ceasers, and never have any of them eff;d it up. Maybe I could over look the wrong pizza, but then when it comes down to it, the pizzas were just ""meh"". The cheese was boring, no diversity, just straight out mozzarella, and gooey-gross messy. The first time around it was okay, heated up the next day it was particularly yucky. Also - I got a bad stomach problem that night and woke up *ahem* having to go to the restroom. I spent the rest of the night in and out. I decided it must have been the pizza, but my husband did not get sick. Then I decided to experiment and took all the pepperoni and jalapenos off the pizza I ate and had it sans-toppings. I did not get tummy trouble after that. Who knows - the sickness may have been something else I ate, but considering the meh quality, the wrong pizza, and my late-night bathroom ventures, I will not be ordering from Joey's Pizza again.

 You don't need a view when your room is this big. The secrecy of Hotwire deals in ""downtown Pittsburgh"" is a situation. Their perimeter crosses into the Southside and whatever you call north of The Point across the bridge. And when you cross reference the hotels in that area on Yelp with the providers on Hotwire, you can end up in very different situations. Then, you can research the Omni price -- $190 regularly -- against the Hotwire deal $120 and it's worth the risk. Large room. Large king bed. Large room service 24 hour menu. Large hallways. Wander them. If you're looking to pull an Aaron Sorkin in a random American city and stay in a hotel without leaving for 24 to 144 hours straight, this is your place in Pittsburgh. The expansive lobby gives you enough fresh air. The front desk staff is simple & accommodating. If you're the type to leave the hotel then it's a decent location. Just know there isn't a decent bar within 5 blocks, and you're only decent walkable option is to jaunt over to Market Square. But if it's summer time and you want to walk to PNC park for a game or the Heinz museum, it's a perfect option. Also, robes. ",0,0,0,1,0

 At first he was great, serviced our pool on time, helped clean it up after buying the home. After 1 year he started to get lazy, missed appointments, he got new help but he didn't train them properly which all leading to increased build up in the pool to where we couldn't use it. He changed out our pump and set the times for low and high settings which both went on at the same time and caused havoc on my system. The final straw was him him forgetting to set a lever back which led to our pool draining in the summer. When I asked him he didn't know what system we had, and he said he would be out the next day to fix it which i threw a hose in to keep it full. A no show. I called and asked for an explanation, he pretty much told me his larger apartment complex clients were more important then I was. I had to let him go. This was over a year ago, he may have changed his ways since then, but something as a new customer should be aware of. ",1,0,0,0,0

 To start off I am a loyal Pita Jungle customer! However, I was very disappointed in my visit this weekend (Saturday Night) to the Pita Jungle in the Arcadia area. I waited forever for a table, which I do not mind waiting but this was a little long for my taste. Also the restaurant looked chaotic, employees running around with no direction and very unorganized. Once I ordered, I once again waiting abnormally long for my food. On a positive note the food was very tasty. I usually enjoy my meals here but this time not so much.

Anyone involved in the concept, production, and marketing of this feces fest, should be fired and banned from EVER producing anything again.

 I signed up for a deal through Southwest Airlines for 35% off my car rental. I was moving from Chicago to Arizona at the time. After a long trip I arrived at the rental desk. My original quote was for 310.00. This was for a week of a rental of a mid size SUV. After going though all of the initial paper work my total came out to be $660.00. The price had doubled due to me not having car insurance. I was obviously not happy but understood I needed to be covered. They informed me that This would not be charged to my account until I returned the vehicle. A day alter I notice that $890.00 was talked out of my account. After calling them they stated there was a $200.00 deposit fee. Why would you take a deposit if you already too the money out of my account????? After returning the care 5 days early ( I bought a car and obtained insurance) I asked them to possible reimburse me for the insurance I was charged for the days I had the car. If not the 4 days I had it at least the day I had insurance. They refused and told me I should be satisfied that they are crediting me my account for returning the car early?? After being to exhausted with moving across country and buying a new car I refused to fight. The total I ended up being charged for rental from Friday- Monday was $441. 00. I would not be using them again nor will I recommend their customer service or management to ANYONE. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The price range is reasonable; Damon's charged about the same for a rack of ribs, and they're a sports bar. If you're complaining on the price, you're looking for a ribs joint in the ghetto, which this certainly isn't. The price is high (sides are separate), but not ludicrous. The appetizers were spot-on; beans, cornbread, mac & cheese, coleslaw; these are all perfect. But the ribs and fried chicken we had were bad. The most expensive things on our bill weren't good; the main courses weren't any good. It took about twenty minutes for our food to come out, which is a bad sign at a BBQ joint; usually, the food is cooked for hours, but they should be able to serve it up quick at that point. My girlfriend had half a fried chicken, and we debated sending it back when it hit the table. It had been in the fryer waaaay too long, and the outside of everything was burned. It looked burned and blackened. It tasted burned. Ugh. In my case, I had a rack of ribs. It was undersmoked; they weren't slow-cooked all the way through. To make up for that, it looked like they'd grilled the hell out of it for those twenty minutes, and burned all of the outside of the ribs. Edible, but not delicious. The wait staff we worked with seemed very new at this. They were perfectly fine waitstaff for a ribs place, but to make it upscale - and sell $10+ drinks! - the wait staff needs a bit more practice and polish. Having a coat rack or coat hook or some place to put a coat in winter was also a strangely missing touch. On the plus side, all of that is fixable, and I'll head back in six months to a year, but man, there are some bugs to work out here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Friend took me here for lunch today - treated me as it is my birthday - YAY. The food was just okay, with an unpleasant surprise. Our initial order was taken quickly. We ordered a couple spring rolls - pretty standard rice paper wrapper with shrimp, vermicelli noodles, and lettuce inside along with a hoisin dip. It also included a dead baby fly inside one of the rolls...GROSS. Maybe because it's my birthday, I didn't even get upset over it. I just moved on (didn't even tell my friend). I thought ""Okay, maybe it was in the lettuce and it just didn't get rinsed out enough..."" I stopped eating that roll and checked the inside of the other, fly free. We also ordered some kind of stir fry with various seafood and veggies. That was okay. My friend was still hungry, so he ordered a bowl of congee, which was kinda blah. The real reason I'm giving this place 1 star is for the dismal service we received. Nick V. is spot-on about the rude and slow service. While our initial order was taken quickly, when the food came out it was also dropped at the edge of our table and the server left without looking at us. It took several ""Excuse me please"" along with hand raising from my friend to get an extra plate so he could share his food with me. When he told one individual he wanted to order something more, there was an actual eye-roll! The menu was extended, then tossed onto a nearby table when my friend ordered his congee. When it came out, a young Asian girl brought it out, shoved it on the table, and when my friend said, ""May we have some spoons and an extra bowl so we can eat it,"" the girl literally stared right at his face with absolutely NO emotion for a good moment. Then grabbed a couple spoons from another table and tossed them on our table. Really? Nick V., please don't assume it's a cultural thing. Both my friend and I are Asian, and we were appalled at the behavior. It was so bad, it was actually funny, in a sad, pathetic way. I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN. I also agree that Pho Avina has EXTREMELY nice owners and servers, along with great food, and THEY will have my continued patronage. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Ironically enough, if you're willing to venture off the Strip in Vegas, sometimes you'll hit a jackpot. Poke Express is one of those type of gems uniquely delivering the Hawaiian islands flavor in the desert that is Las Vegas. We went at around 11am on Sunday and they had initially already sold out of malasadas. Fortunately, they were able to make another batch (w/in 20 minutes) and when fresh, these were amazing. Whether custard filled or just plain, the coating of sugar and the nice crisp flaky dough was tremendous. I recently had a batch frozen and delivered from Hawaii and these malasadas were comparable in quality. Then there's the star of the show, the poke. Really good poke to be exact. I can't attest to how it compares to poke in Hawaii but from all thirdhand accounts it matches up. Not quite there in terms of freshness but a close alternative. My favorite was the shoyu poke because the sauce is a great balance of sweetness that marinades the salmon or tuna to perfection. The spicy avocado poke was more spicy than I expected but having never tried avocado and poke mixed together, I thought it was pretty fantastic. I'd steer clear from the seaweed soaked poke as the salinity of the seaweed was too overpowering. They serve their poke by the 1/4, 1/2, and 1 lb sizes and we started by trying four different 1/4 lb. containers. Just a note, thats not nearly enough and we had to double up on what we ordered between two people. Overall, its affordable and delicious comfort food served with welcoming hospitality. It's like your own slice of Hawaii only a couple thousand miles away. Tip: Get here early, especially on the weekends, because at noon this place is jam packed with large parties. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We decided to install an entry gate for our house. We wanted a gate that didn't look too busy, yet not so plain that it looked like prison bars. We decided on a design that was simple with knuckles spread throughout to break it up. Unfortunately when it arrived, there were less knuckle than we had agreed to and it look like the prison bars we didn't want. We got a hold of Angel, he had the guys take a picture for him to look at while on the phone with us. He acknowledged that there weren't enough knuckles. He gave us two options, for the guys to take the gate to return and fix it or to take $150 off the remaining bill. We decided for them to fix it. One of the guys suggested instead of knuckles, adding four casters along the plain bars. They wouldn't have to take the gate and could come by within the week to finish the job. They returned to finish the job, they installed the casters, also put a plate along the hinge portion and a sturdy door stop to keep the gate from hitting the garage wall. All without any additional cost. The gate looks great and we are completely satisfied. Thank you Olson Iron and Angel for making sure we were satisfied. They also told us to call any time if we ever have any problems and they would take care of it. I know it's not an empty promise. ",0,0,0,0,1

 YOU'LL BE SORRY IF YOU DINE HERE. I ended up at this beer joint because I was herded into it by a group of friends, who were starving and just wanted to sit down and eat. THE FOOD: Is commercial at best and expensive. A better dinning experience can be had by buying a Swanson Mexican TV dinner and taking it to your room. To make things worse, the service was slow. The waitress acted bothered when someone from the party made a request. THE BILL: They added an 18% gratuity and some other mystery charge ( check your receipt for it) When my friend confronted the waitress about this other fee, she was told that all places in Vegas charge this fee. Well, we ate at many other restaurants and never saw that added charge anywhere; CROOKS. Lastly, when we paid our bill, in cash, the waitress never brought our change? When my friend asked where our change was she said, ""We always keep the change."" LOL! AS IF! We made her give us our change back. She reached into her apron pocket, grabbed an uncounted amount of coins and said, ""Here."" (the rest of that was, ""Now go away!"") Go to Mon Ami Gabi, if you want superior food and a classy (ambiance/clientele), dining experience; it is only down the street, in front of The Paris hotel, and less expensive! ",1,0,0,0,0

 4 Stars for reasonable prices, good food, and one of the managers, Bob for overcoming the poor customer service of one individual, Sabrina. Six of us were seated at a booth. When the above aforementioned employee approached to take our order I advised her that my wife and I will be on a separate ticket. She said that she was not able to do that because we were all seated at the same booth. I asked that if we were seated at the booth next to this one we could be on a separate ticket, she told me ""yep"". I asked what the difference was that we were here and not there, without explaining why she just came our with ""it's policy, and is written right in the menu"". I told her then we wont be returning. Her response is the exact reason why honest working people employed in less desirable positions get a bad rap. Their mindset is this ain't my place so what do I care if you come back or not.

 Yay for good skin exams! I admit I was a slacker for the past few years and didn't go for my annual full body check at the dermatologist. Therefore, I was a little nervous about my appointment. Not only did I have a few freckles / sun spots / moles that popped up over the years, but I had a baby too... and god knows what happens to your skin during a pregnancy and beyond! Anyways, I knew it was time for a visit, but I didn't have time to trek to North Phoenix to the sister office of Scottsdale Dermatology Ltd (see my review for that office here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenix-dermatology-ltd-phoenix#hrid:XPNvqTMH5MP_ME0Fem3Yrg), where I'd been before, so I trusted my husband on this one and called this location instead. The woman that answered the phone was super friendly and scheduled an appointment for me to see Kendall Jenson, PA-C the following week. When the time came for my appointment, I followed the directions to this office on my Yelp app, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how close it was to where I live and work, and there was plenty of shaded street parking when I arrived... bonus! I didn't have to wait too long once I arrived, and I had a good experience. Luckily, Kendall was not too concerned about any of my freckles/sun spots/ moles, and he answered all of the questions I had for him. Before I left, they had me self address a post card that they will send to me for my annual visit next year... hopefully, I'll keep up with my annual appointments going forward. Now that I have a dermatologist nearby, I really have no excuses. What's yours?! ",0,0,0,1,0

 YUM-ME Me and a buddy decided to explore downtown on a Wednesday Night. I read some really great reviews about this place and it did not disappoint. We walked in to a large hallway shared by several businesses where the hostess stand was located. We asked for a table. The hostess made a pouty face and explained they were booked but we could sit and eat at the bar if we would like. My adventure begun. My buddy who has lost a ton of weight was on a strict diet of salmon. See review Yelp Review about anyone (actually the Yelper's Date) ordering salmon. I decided if he was going to order salmon - I would have to increase the ""manly"" portion at the bar - I ordered the large bone in ribeye (the one that feeds 2). I was not really hungry but I knew I would have some awesome leftovers and make my buddy regret any diet he was putting himself thru. My meal was right out of a Fred Flinstone cartoon... it was served on a large cutting board over quartered potatoes topped with a femur with fresh Bone Marrow butter. I ordered an appetizer as well of the bone marrow - I always see the chefs (see Travel Channel, Food Network) order bone marrow and spread it on toast. It is a meat flavored butter. He said his meal was really good. My meal was far superior. Overall reivew: Atmosphere - very trendy - very crowded and next to a Cabaret Place - which would be very cool to have dinner then catch a show if I was on a date. Prices - This place is not bad considering. Meals were about $85 but really we ordered 3 meals (the Steak was really for 2 people) + Appetizer. You can get pricey alcohol as well - I recommend Porkslap Beer and bourbon :-) - they have a unique 12 year - very good Service - We sat at the bar - our bartender was great. A very high recommend and a good stop if you are traveling and find yourself in Downtown Pittsburgh! ",0,0,0,0,1
