 I like this Super Walmart better than one in Avondale. It's bigger, cleaner and sanitize wipes are always at the entrance. And they carry my favorite Tazo tea and Girard's salad dressing. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This review is not in regards to the food. It was very good, I liked the egg rolls and the orange chicken tasted very authentic. Although, my boyfriend and I sat down and the server mentioned something we couldn't quite understand as we sat he came to mention how handsome my boyfriend was? Thanks but making a pass at my boyfriend with me there is not only rude but awkward. Then proceeded to say I have to say you are beautiful because I told him he is handsome. Well thanks for the not needed added comment. And for hurting my feelings. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Most of the reviews tend to focus on the food service. Technically there are other yelp locations for this place and reading those individual reviews will be more helpful if you're planning on getting anything other than from the snack or dessert bars. You can look up: Full restaurant: http://www.yelp.com/biz/347-grill-maricopa Bar/in-theater dining: http://www.yelp.com/biz/luxe-lounge-maricopa Desert bar: Cones Cafe (no separate yelp location) As far as the center itself goes: this is a great place to get a lot done. I've spent several date nights just here and it's only a couple of miles from our home in Maricopa. The place is always clean, the staff usually quite helpful though we did find once a movie (Elysium) was shown as rated PG-13 instead of rated R. Thankfully our kids weren't there that night. The biggest drawback is they show most of the places to eat as separate so choose where you eat accordingly. I've found it's best to eat at the 347 Grill rather than the in-show food/drinks for Star Class tickets (Luxe Lounge review spoiler alter: the novelty wears off quickly with such poor service; eat BEFORE your movie). Aside from the food, UltraStar has top-notch entertainment, especially for Maricopa. While the prices reflect the lack of local competition, several discounts are available including student rates, free movie nights, kids events and most recently their 2 year anniversary where tickets were $2 (as well as $2 drinks and $2 popcorn). All in all, my favorite place to go when I'm too lazy to make it into the valley for a date. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I absolutely LOVE this store. I moved to Las Vegas in November 2013 and I've had such bad luck with furniture stores since I've been here. I went to Furniture Markdowns to browse after an unpleasant experience and obtaining a refund from a big name furniture store. In disgust I googled furniture stores and Furniture Markdowns was first on the list. I drove the 13 miles and boy am I ever glad I did! Momma & Mike were so helpful, I really like their personal customer service, not pushy at all, and Momma sat with me and mapped out my furniture placement. I was told on Monday, my furniture would be here at 10:00 AM today, and it came on time and it looks beautiful. I absolutely love Furniture Markdowns!! I plan on going back there as I saw a couple of pieces that I'm interested in (and the lifetime delivery charge doesn't hurt either!) I wish I could give Furniture Markdowns 100 stars, because in my book, they deserve it! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Fantastic experience here. Very friendly waiter. No MSG in their food, which is huge to me. It does not need it, anyway. We had the green curry and it was great. Also ordered the Herbal Salad, which was recommended here by several yelp'ers. It was very lemongrass-y, which was good for a few bites, but I could not eat a whole plate of it. My husband had no problem eating a good deal of it, though. The coconut milk curry was great. We also ordered the mango with sticky rice dessert, as well as the fried banana with homemade coconut ice cream. The ice cream is to die for. best I've had in a while-- and homemade! :) Mango sticky rice was wonderful, too, and I haven';t found many places that make it with coconut milk only instead of sweetened condensed milk. So happy to find a vegan version! ",0,0,0,0,1

 The selection is good, the prices are pretty good. On major liquor brands, you can often find better prices at your grocery store. For specialty wines and beers, they are better priced than Whole Foods but similar to Lee's. Their strength is definitely their selection across all alcohol types. If you need to buy liquor, beer, and wine, it's a nice one-stop shop that offers some different things than Lee's. The service is where things start to fall apart. It seems the only knowledgeable people on the staff are the management. Ask the regular floor staff a question and usually they are clueless unless the answer involves generalities like ""the beer is over there."" Even the management has problems with answering questions about upcoming releases, but at least they know something about the stock. Also, they don't restock after they close or before they open, they restock during the lunch-break rush. They block off whole aisles and don't move even when it's obvious you are trying to get to something. During the restock, the general opinion of the staff seems to be that the customers need to get out of their way and they don't make any attempt to get around their customers. While it is nice to have an alternative to Lee's and they do have a wide selection, it would be nice if they took the time to educate their staff on how to treat customers and some basics of alcohol.

 This is literally a hidden gem on 16th Street and Bethany Home. There is no signage outside so you just have to find it. The place is TINY, essentially a bar and a few tables and a function room behind the usually closed door by the entrance. As with their sister restaurant Rokerij, the smell of burning wood permeates the place. They serve beer and cocktails and have a good selection of wine. The food here is great. If you don't mind waiting this is a great place for brunch. The green chile meatloaf is probably my favorite-it is served over a tortilla with beans and two eggs. OH IT IS SOOOOO GOOD!!!! I also had green chile stew which was fantastic as well. One of my favorite places to hit in Phoenix. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Went here because we had a groupon. Not opposed to going back, but would not make a special trip for to get there. Chips seemed to be out of a bag, the salsa was tomatoes and salt--and a very small portion at that. Entree portions were large, hot and tasty. I had the chilequiles, and had no complaints. The chicken was done well and the sauce was nice and spicy like I like it. Hubby had sampler of enchiladas, no complaints. Daughter had veggie plate #4, and she thought it was good. That's it, good--not great--no complaints! Wait staff was very nice! ",0,1,0,0,0

 We visited Trophy's this weekend. Driven by it numerous times and decided to give it a shot. It was semi okay, but probably will not be going back. First off, the menu states that the dinner comes with a dinner roll. Neither my husband nor myself received this. We both had the cesar salad and mine was lacking hardly any dressing and the lettuce was way too large. I also tried to order the prime rib, however was told that they were out of it, so I had to go with my second choice of a rib eye. Now, I would expect a steakhouse to be able to cook a killer steak right? Hmm not so much. The flavor was good, but my husband and I both ordered our steaks medium rare and both were EXTREMELY rare. To top it off, the knives were poorly sharpened so we both sat there mauling our meat with sub-par knives. And where I expect ribeyes to be fatty to an extent, the 12oz that I ordered was at least 1/3 fat, which was disappointing. My baked potato was pretty undercooked and hard in places. I also asked for sour cream and chives and was charged $2 extra...not sure what for, maybe because I asked for 2 toppings instead of one? The asparagus was very tasty though. We took our almost 11 year old with us and I was absolutely disgusted with their kid's menu. Only one semi healthy thing on the menu. My son was grossed out by a FRIED peanut butter and jelly (for dinner really??). Since it's a steakhouse and he loves steak he was looking forward to getting a kid's steak meal...they had none. Why does a steakhouse have no steak for the kids? He settled on the pasta, but the side is french fries which he typically prefers fresh fruit, veggies, or a salad. He was informed that they do not have fruit and was informed that veggies or salad do not come with the kid's meals only fries (or sweet potato fries for an extra $2). He was very bummed to be going to a steakhouse and he ends up with pasta and marinara sauce and french fries that he didn't even eat. Not sure why giving the kid a salad instead of fries was not okay. He said the pasta was okay but said the sauce just tasted like plain tomatoe sauce with nothing in it. I find it hard to support a place that doesn't even offer a healthy option for kids who choose to eat healthier. NOt sure why when they offer veggies and salads for the adults they can't make that a side choice for the kids that would prefer it and why they couldn't offer a 3oz grilled sirloin for the kids who would want it. Honestly, when Texas Roadhouse is down the road, a good $5-$6 per meal cheaper, offers healthier side options for kids as well as steak for the kids, and I've never had an issue ordering the prime rib there or having my steak over or undercooked either. Very sad about that, because I enjoy promoting and supporting the local busineses and I LOVED that not only is it a locally owned business but the owners also live locally and my son got a HUGE kick out of the decor of this place and the story behind it as well. But, I found the prices to be a good $5-$6 higher than they really should be, the kid's menu poorly done, and the food to be just okay, so I probably would not spend the extra money to return.

 Thanks to Groupon I didn't have to pay full price for this mess! I will not be returning to this salon anytime soon and if I did it would NOT be with Josh! His conversation during my treatment was very unprofessional with his coworkers, he barely talked to me at all, and then my hair cut and deep conditioning treatment took TWO hours! I have curly hair and he cut my hair curly then straighten it (which I did not want done) because he said he had to ""make sure it was even."" I think if you have to straighten someones curly hair just to make sure it's even then maybe you should only be cutting straight hair. Never in my life has anyone had to cut my hair curly THEN straighten it and cut it again! That's just crazy! And when I mentioned this to him his response was ""ha ha I know what I'm doing, I do this shit all day"". Lastly on top of all that mess be BURNED my scalp TWICE with the straightener. I will never go back to him and I may never go back to this salon, but if I do it will be with one of the girls that has good reviews on here! Other than him, the receptionist was very pleasant, she offered me something to drink, the music was good, the salon was clean and well taken care of, and they also had a sign up that said something along the lines of ""If your children aren't here for services, please leave them at home."" which I find refreshing because it seems like everywhere I go now a days is also a unofficial daycare! Bottom line If you don't have Josh I'm sure you will have a much better experience than I had. ",1,0,0,0,0

 On the recommendation of a Yelp Elite friend we stopped in for lunch while on a quick trip to Vegas. The staff is super friendly and they have a great selection of food. We had a 3 year old with us and she enjoyed the food. We had the kabobs with french fries, hummus and the greek salad. Everything was great. Know before you go: There is another pita restaurant right across the street called Pita Pit, not the same thing at all. DOS 5/19/14 ",0,0,0,1,0

 Met a friend for lunch here one day. Decent place. Not too crowded for a campus town spot. At the suggestion of my friend, I opted for the Nacho plate. Huge serving and it was quite good. Everything is firehouse themed, as far as the menu is concerned and so many of the burgers and sandwiches and wraps sounded delicious. Will have to go again sometime and try one. Service was quick and friendly. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I stayed here in July when a friend and I went to Montreal for the weekend. It was an okay hotel. It was just a very old building so the rooms felt very old style. The doors of the hotel was very bulky and old. The cleaning ladies kept waking us up everyday at 8am and we had to send them away- they DIDN'T GIVE US ANY PRIVACY SIGNS. However, the front desk were REALLY friendly people, and they chatted us about things to do and where to go. Super nice customer service. The TV is not a flat screen, which by now, is considered old. The room was around $215 a night. Location is great though! Walking distance to everything you need- we went to Old Montreal, Basilica, Chinatown. For the price, it wasn't so bad. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I'm not really sure how to rate this place. I got a steak, mashed potatoes and peas & carrots. Peas & carrots...nuff said, I was unaware that they accompanied the meal. My steak was so tough that running over it with my truck tire wouldn't even tenderize this thing!!!!! But....it had the best flavor. Now on to the mashed potatoes, once again good flavor but I could have made a shovel stand up on my plate they were so thick! ",0,1,0,0,0

 This was a decent choice for what I would consider to be a middle of the road average restaurant. We headed to NYNY hotel in search of dinner. We had no clue where we would end up but knew there would plenty of choices. This was the first place we saw and we decided to go with it. The bread was delicious and I could tell the olive oil was a decent quality. Not the best I've ever had, but for the price point certainly not the worst. We did have to ask for cheese, but they brought it over right away. As with every single restaurant in Vegas they are slow with water service. I guess they want people to pass out? The pollo al peperoncino sounded so amazing all 3 of us ordered it. It was chicken marinated with rosemary, sage, thyme, crushed red pepper, white wine, Dijon mustard and lemon. It was really good! The chicken was so tender and cooked perfectly. I'm sure the pasta was better (just a preference) but I knew I needed protein and to lay off the carbs! The saut \ u00e9ed spinach and potatoes served with the dish were a bit of a let down. I felt for the prices this was one of the better meals I had in Vegas this go around. The entrees were in the $18-26 range. I've had sub sandwiches in food courts in Vegas cost more than that. The staff was friendly and seemed to accommodate us pretty quickly. I just wish they would step up the game with water in all of these hotels! I know it's the desert, but you have dehydrated drunks running around! ",0,0,0,1,0

 The food was really great, we sat at the bar and after we were finished with our sushi we watched one of the sushi chefs pick his nose... Oh yes. Not only did he not wear gloves, not only did he pick his nose... but after he picked his nose he rolled whatever was in his fingers into the palm of his hand and looked at it!!! When he was done picking his nose he stuck his hand in the steamed rice cooker, and went on to prepare more sushi. We had ordered two more rolls before witnessing this, so we asked our waiter for a to go box, the box and its contents were left on the chairs outside. Upon our arrival to Sushi Creek we sat at the bar for at least 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged our presence. The Nose Picker stood behind the bar drinking his coffee flavored Monsters beverage, and glanced at us a few times. Our waiter finally came around, he was very nice and somewhat attentive. The (Japanese?) woman sushi chef, wore gloves and changed them often, she was also very nice. (It's not so much the not wearing gloves that bothers me about The Nose Picker, you could not wear gloves and wash frequently. Just don't pick your nose and the prepare food!!!). The hostess and at least 4 other waitresses spent the majority of their time talking to a regular customer about some girl being punched in the face and about how the other waitress got dumped a day after her birthday and was pissed about it. The entire time we were there, the really old waitress with the auburn-ish colored hair, with an iphone with a blue cover; did not wait on another customer while we were there... for an hour and a half she just stood in front of this old guy, that was it! Another annoyance that really started to bother us after The Nose Picker incident was that the old guys phone (which was on the bar) kept vibrating. This wouldn't have mattered so much, however the vibration was so powerful that by the end of the short time we were there we so fed up. We were sitting more than 6ft away and could hear the entire conversation with the waitresses, including watching several other staff walk in from the back to 'hang out'. Then we watch the woman sushi chef eat her dinner behind the bar as well as other staff eat their dinner. The food is good, until we saw the extra ingredients that weren't on the menu being added. Service was poor. We will not be dining here again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The paper itself is short on content - with a cheap feel. The website - OK - but short on real content, lots of ad links, news available elsewhere with cleaner designed and faster loading pages. Customer Service - poor - they seem to be unable to cancel a bill for a nonexistent subscription, and unable to explain new emails thanking me for setting up a new subscription and looking to establish ""EZPay"" even though no subscription was initiated. Overall - better news elsewhere. Wish the few good writers would get together and form a quality subscription service - that I'd pay for. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I really liked this place right from when I walked in the door. I always bring my own nail polish (in case of touch ups later) so I can not attest to the color selection. They were super busy but still had me in a chair to get a pedicure in a minute or two. The pedicure was pretty good. The only better one I had was $100+ one from a resort spa. The woman used mint lotion and then put the hot wet towel over my feet and legs which felt amazing. Then I got a manicure, which I wasn't planning on but they had a special for mani + pedi = free brow wax which I couldn't pass up. The manicure was nice. They have these fan shelves for your hands between coats. I liked that perk a lot since I haven't seen it anywhere else. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because the waxing part was unpleasant. They did a good job but the wax was a lot hot and the woman rushed though it even though it came out good. Brow wax is something that should have be rushed. Overall this place will definitely be getting more of my business and my friends. I might try to come on a weekday afternoon though since it was pretty busy. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is College of Southern Nevada's Hospitality/Culinary Dept's restaurant. The front of the house staff are students in the school's Restaurant Management class. The food are prepared by Culinary Arts students in one of the Culinary Department's restaurant classes (e.g., Aromatics, French, International), with menu changing daily during the weeks that the instructional restaurant is open. This is a sample menu prepared by students in the Aromatics class from 10-14-2008: Choice of Soups or Salads Butternut Squash Soup with Garam Masala or Wild Rice Soup with Fresh Marjoram, Seasonal Mixed Greens with choice of Maytag Blue Cheese Dressing, Apple-Walnut Vinaigrette, or Asian-Orange Vinaigrette. Choice of Entr \ u00e9es: Grilled Marinated Ahi Tuna served with Fried Wasabi Potato Cakes and Hot and Spicy Eggplant with toasted Sesame Seeds. Linguine tossed in White Clam Sauce with Littleneck Clams and Fresh Oregano. Curried Lamb and Vegetable Stew served over Cous-Cous with Mint Chiffonade. One of 3 Dessert selections prepared by Pastry Students in the program. All meals include Homemade Bread or Rolls prepared by CSN Culinary Arts Students under the direction of Master Pastry Chef/Professor Rudi Eichler and Pastry Chef/Instructor Ms. Jody Lee. Price $7.95 (tax included, tips goes toward CSN Scholarship fund) North Las Vegas is far for most ppl, especially with the freeway and road constructions currently causing havoc on Las Vegas roads, but if you are in the area it is well worth the drive. The dessert that is served alone can cost $7+ in a typical restaurant with its own Pastry Chef. This is literally the best deal in town when the school is in session. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We returned to Star of India recently to enjoy the lunch buffet on a weekend. The restaurant was pretty empty the last three times we've been here--I hope that's not a bad sign! The buffet is somewhat limited as others have noted. There is stuff to make salad, plus about 8 entrees, various sauces, rice, naan, a few desserts, and Indian tea. Everything is quite delicious, but if you are looking to sample a wide variety of Indian cuisine, this won't quite do the trick. The entrees are quite filling though--I really had to press myself to try a little bit of everything. You will leave feeling like you just ate enough to last for two days!

 I was pleasantly surprised by a recent and first visit to Osteria Papavero. Upon arrival on a Monday evening around 6 PM I was a little concerned that we were the only patrons. Further, the interior is very casual, dare I say ""Ikea-esque"" but perfectly comfortable. Upon being seated we were handed a pretty light menu with few options. The chalk board at the north end of the dinning room helped our waitress explain a few of the available specials that night. What was offered included fresh seafood such as Octopus along with Halibut and a beef dish a friend ordered. I don't remember all the details but what I do remember is that the food was excellent, fresh, creative, and unique. In fact, it was the first time I'd been served an entire whole octopus though I've ordered octopus many a time. This is going to be a short review cuz I just want to get it in but rest assured, this is about as close as you're going to get to European style dinning in the Midwest. There are certainly more upscale Italian restaurants and there are certainly more traditional Italian restaurants but Papavero gives you a real feel for freshly prepared, creative food. I truly enjoyed my meal there. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Scheduled my appointment online, fast and easy. Used to go to the one on Scottsdale Rd., they closed that one down, guess 2 stores within 1 mile of each other isn't good for businesses. They are trained to replace your tires and wheels and nothing else, so you know you will get the highest quality of helps from them and they won't try to sell you anything that you don't need. They will recommend you the products and never be pushy about it. One thing they need to improve is to maybe have a free Wi-Fi service. But do give them a chance if you have never come here before!

 They should add a tagline to Nicky's Thai Kitchen as Thai food heaven. If you are from out of town (like me), don't be fooled by the entrance of this restaurant. Once you go it, just ask for a table outside and you would be surprised to see the decor and the Thai cultural design of their outdoor seating. My wife and I visited the National Aviary which is less than a mile from this restaurant. We spent almost 5 hours at the aviary and wanted to eat lunch at around 3PM. So, I looked up nearby Thai restaurants on Yelp and Nicky's shows up first on the list. Quick look at the reviews and menu on my phone and we were on our way to check this place out for ourselves. Luckily found metered parking right in front of the restaurant. We entered not being very sure how much longer the restaurant will be open for lunch. There were hardly any people dining inside the restaurant. My wife asked to be seated outside even though it was around 90+ degrees heat. When we walked out through the wooden structures and plants and golden buddha statues and entered the outdoor seating area, it was 75% occupied and the Sun didn't even seem to bother any of us. The menu is extensive with all the traditional Thai dishes. We ordered a veg fried rice and a eggplant stir fry with tofu. Both the dishes came with a choice of soup or salad. Everything tasted real good and the staff service was very nice. We clicked a ton of pictures of the place as it was very beautifully done with waterfalls and statues and wooden wheels etc. When the bill finally arrived it was less than $20 for a heavy meal with excellent service and ambience.

 Maybe it was all the hype, maybe it was the high prices, or maybe it just wasn't that good. I dunno, I suppose that I have high standards when it comes to a sandwich - and in all my years this is the 1st Italian sandwich I've ever had that just overwhelmed me with sweetness (for the record, NOT a flavor most want on a sandwich not involving peanut butter or Nutella). I'm guessing it was the mustard that caused the sweet flavor - taking that off might improve the whole thing greatly - but it was also soggy by the time I got home. Major points for the modern age Coke machine (with a gajillion flavor combinations) but that's not enough to woo me. It's a good idea to steam your meats and cheeses, I imagine that does change the flavor profile a bit, but not enough to charge me ten bucks for a soggy / sweet footlong. I might be back, but mostly for the freakin' cool soda machine. Until they can be beaten, Jersey Mikes still takes the pickle for one of the best sandwich franchises ever. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This is a fun place to go if you don't have to pay any cover, which usually runs around $25 on weekends. Otherwise, save your money and go somewhere else. Suggestion: Tao for the clubbers, Caramel for the loungers, and Body English for the small venuers. We were hotel guests and didn't have to pay admission. It helps to pick one go-to bartender and tip him/her well. Why? It usually leads to free drinks and getting away with a lot of ridiculous stuff (i.e. my gf walked off with whip cream and a full cup of cherries). The crowd is not so good looking with mostly wannabes from East to West. Guy to girl ratio is poor ... although if you're a girl looking for any type of male attention, this is the place. There were a lot of bachelor parties, men in their 40s plus, and girl groups who didn't know better. Rumjungle used to be the IT place but not now. Regardless, I'm giving it 3 stars because we had a lot of fun due to 1) no cover, 2) free drinks, and 3) short trip home (only one elevator ride away). ",0,1,0,0,0
