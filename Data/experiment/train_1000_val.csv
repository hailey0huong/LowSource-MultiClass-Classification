 Food is yummy and the portions are huge I suggest splitting. It's a great place to people watch also. I have never been on the lounge side. The decor is unusual to say the least. Low ceilings with dark mirrored tiles. Purple booths. Very kitchy. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This review is strictly for reBAR, because I did not eat at Bliss. I very rarely give out one star ratings, but I very rarely get terrible service. I came in on a busy Friday night with two other people, and I went to the inside bar to get a drink while they went to the bathroom. As a side note - the bathroom is in a really weird location, so the line extends out to where people are sitting at tables. I stood at the front of the bar and ended up waiting for service for 10-15 minutes, which is completely understandable, except for the fact that I was watching everyone get served except me. I was beginning to think that it was me, since I was watching people left and right get cycled out at the bar. I finally got the courage to raise my hand and ask for three beers. The bartender, very rudely, snapped at me saying, ""you will wait your turn"" I understand that the bar was busy, but even the guy next to me commented on how long I had been standing there. After that, I left and went to the bar outside. The bartender promptly served me immediately upon arriving and even bought one of my beers to make up for the bad service. I never send food back, I'm a good tipper, and I'm friendly to servers. I am NEVER a rude customer, so I was extremely disgusted with my treatment. I will never be back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 One of the best pubs in Edinburgh. PRICE: Reasonable for what it sells, expensive in comparison to other pubs. SIZE: Plenty of alcoves and rooms, giving the place a big feel, but it is in fact not that big. FEEL: The pub is decorated in a tasteful, traditional manner, and is lit warmly. RANGE: The pub stocks a regularly replenished supply of real ale, and they also have a wide selection of top class whiskies and spirits. They often have some surprising delights on tap, such as Aspall cider. TOILETS: Drop down some stairs and find the excellent toilets, well fitted and clean. I first started coming here a couple of years ago with the Grampian Speleological Group (a caving club), where they have their regular meets. We as a large group are well catered-for, and a large space is set aside for us. The staff are friendly, helpful, and always have a drink-related bit of advice to give if you are stumped for ideas as to which of the many real ales and ciders to buy. Prices are not cheap, but equally are not unreasonable for the quality of ales they offer. I love the design of the place too. It has a higgledy-piggledy arrangement of alcoves and rooms that give the place a really interesting feel. Not their choice in particular, simply what happens when you set a pub under an old New Town building. The pub is quite a way away from the city centre or indeed the student south, which has its advantages and disadvantages. It means that it is empty of Forest Caf \ u00e9 crumpets and rowdy rowers, but it also means that it requires a long trek to get to. Well worth it though. I would give this fine establishment two thumbs-up and a shiny gold sticker. ",0,0,0,0,1

 The worst Roberto's - ordered a #4 which is the 2 taco combo and a carne asada burrito to go. Got home and saw that the tacos barely had meat in it so went back to the restaurant to give them an opportunity to fix the issue, instead the cashier had a poor pissed attitude telling us that that's how they come?!? We've been ordering this for years I mean years and this was the very first time I've seen it poorly executed. A two taco for a buck was way better than that food. I was so livid I was not able to take a photo of the mess. We will never go back to this restaurant. Poor attitude, service, and worst food! I see closure in y'all's future! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Maybe Jet Blue has spoiled me. I fly Jet Blue to Oakland a couple times a year and my flight has never left late. Last time I flew to Vegas it was Jet Blue and once again on time. So last week I go to Vegas for a convention and have to go with my co-workers and they all wanted to fly out of John Wayne/Orange County and not my beloved Long Beach Airport. So we had to deal with US Airways. At our flight departure time of 11:15 am our plane wasn't even at the gate yet. By the time we boarded and got in the air it was already past our arrival time. I had exactly 3 minutes and 45 seconds to drink my soda before being told they had to pick it up because the plane was preparing to land. Our arrival was 1 hour and 15 minutes late with no offers of apologies and no explanations. One star for not crashing and one for a cheap ticket. But next time I'll be flying Jet Blue. ",0,1,0,0,0

 That rosemary bread...... basically the reason I go there. Everything I have had on the menu (mostly steak) was delicious. I could fill up on the bread though...its to good. The atmosphere is nice and there is a lot of cool history clippings and photos on the wall. The restaurant is located on Mill Ave and right across the street from Tempe Town lake which is a nice park to walk down after a romantic dinner. :) ",0,0,0,0,1

 This hotel has it all! First off, when you stay during the week, you can get some good rates on suites, which are great, room, comfortable and 2 bathrooms with a super comfy King size bed. It's close in proximity to a bunch of other hotels and the mall! Would definitely stay here again...beware of the 22.50 extra tax they charge per night, BUT you get a coupon for a buy one get one free drink, 2 free buffets, $20 off your next stay, so it does pay for itself in the end.

 Gone to a few of these foot spas back in California, and I generally like them a lot. Came here with my husband for nice relaxing massage after two nights of nonstop dancing at the clubs. Ended up getting one of the most painful massages. The guy masseur seemed to be using all of his strength. After a while he asked if the pressure was ok. By that point he had eased up a bit so I said it was ok. Right after that he ended up adding more and more pressure until it was so painful. At the end of the massage he hit his hands so hard on me, supposedly to loosen out any last knots, and I felt like I was getting a beating. With so many other foot spas on the same street, I don't think we'll be coming back here again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 There are so many pastry shops to choose from now on this street. I was determined to try as many as I could within the short time I was visiting Montreal. Callia stood out in my mind because they have a larger selection of crispy pastrys with meat fillings, as well as many of the bun varieties. I had my eye on all of the curry filled pastries and tried one of each. They were not as flavorful as I was hoping for and I recommend reheating in a toaster oven instead of the microwave. The bacon and onion bun gave me a stomach ache for a couple of days, which made it difficult to sample further. I was not able to try their bubble teas, but I did like the passion fruit bottled tea.

 This place had just okay sushi. The prices are good. HOWEVER, the service is the absolutely worse! The waitress/hostess was unaware of people waiting to even turn in their order. When I received the wrong roll I approached the cook and his response was not that he was sorry but that I should have told him exactly what I wanted. I thought that was what the menu was for? Worse ever. Don't waste your time here. Three tables were used and all three while I was there complained about the service. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The menu here is really unique... This is not an IHOP! The first time I went was for breakfast and I had the corned beef hash. It was pretty really good because it was ""real"" corned beef hash. (You will see what I mean.) There was so much of it that I had to take it home. It was a complete meal though because it also included eggs and fruit. I did not like the lemonade they served. It tasted gross, but oddly, I think it was supposed to taste that way... My most recent visit was for dinner. I had the sage chicken with the penne pasta. I did not like the pasta, but the chicken was pretty good. My boyfriend got the sage fried chicken and waffles. He thought it was amazing and so did I! As far as food presentation goes, they do that very well. The food (during breakfast) is served on these large, heavy skillets. Dinner is served on large (and I mean large) plates. I adore Hash House. They not only make food good, they make it fun. I love this ""twisted"" farm food. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Getting waxed by Marianne as I write! She is sweet, professional, and keeps the pain at a minimum with the two types of wax she uses.

 This place isn't for the poor...as in people with poor taste buds because this place is delicious! Seated within The Mirage on the Strip, Kokomo's is definitely an impressive, fine-dining experience. Here's a link to the menu: http://www.mirage.com/restaurants/kokomos.aspx The ambiance was very dark and quiet with music playing gently in the background. The waiter was extremely attentive without being annoying. The cranberry and bacon bread was amazing! I don't even like bread but this was something exquisite. My date ordered the Lobster Bisque Soup with a Puff Pastry Dome. It was definitely a larger portion than she anticipated but it certainly was amazing. I had a caesar salad with an egg-less dressing and crisp parmesan cheese ( I held the anchovies). We both ordered the 8 oz fillet, oscar topped. Definitely the best steak I've had in long time. Not the best I've had but what's wrong with a close second. We also had Washington apple martinis as that was the drink on special. I can't remember how it's made but it certainly was unique and tasty. This place is a little pricey. Just two of us came to a little over $200 for what I described above but you're in Vegas, everything is a little pricey. I wouldn't pay that much for USDA prime anywhere else. For that price you can get certified Angus beef or even Kobe. Overall, this is a great dining experience if you're looking for something more classy and quiet to take your date too while your in Vegas. I'm sad to say that I just heard that Kokomo's will be closing effective January 13th, 2013. I guess I'll have to find a new fine dining experience when I go back. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I came in here because I heard so much about it on Yelp and different local weeklies. I'm glad Yelpers told me that it was in the Spa Salon because I would have never found it. It was evening when I came in so it was rather quiet throughout the place. I like quiet. I walked up to the counter and recognized Jenny. We volunteered for a Yelp event the week before. I tell you she's good at sales and passing out Yelp flyers. Ok, back on track, she explained the menu to me and I ordered the sesame noodles and the combo bao special. As I was waiting, I was served a duck consomme.. how fancy. Did not expect that at all and it was the first time I've had duck consomme. It was surprisingly good especially with the mini diced carrots. Noodles next, I did not think the noodles was going to be such a large portion but I finished it all, really quickly mind you. It was simple and to the point. I know it's not traditional but I would have liked mine to be really spicy. Nothing like spicy noodles to open up your appetite. And next the baos, I had pork belly, duck and vege. Because I'm generally not a bun/white bread eater, I ended up eating the inside and left a lot of bao. Insides of all the baos I had were seasoned perfectly and had great flavor. Of course my favorite one was the pork belly. You can never go wrong with pork belly. Looking forward to my next visit. Hope you are well Jenny and Sheriden. Like I said you have a niche business and thank you for opening and providing us with great baos! ",0,0,0,0,1

 We went there for the first time yesterday, and I would definitely recommend Spartan Pizza. Here's why: - the crust is thin, crunchy on the bottom, chewy on top - the sauce is sweet and savory - the cheese is rich and delicious - the veggies were fresh and tasty We ordered the Canadian bacon deluxe (with onions, green peppers, green & black olives, and mushroom too I think). The Canadian bacon tasted like real meat and is among the best I've had ... not at all like that heavily processed stuff you usually get at the store. The CBD is naturally quite salty from the bacon and olives but I like that. We also had the small salad which was just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes, but what can you expect for $2? I'd bet the pizza salad is much better. The service was casual and friendly. In regards to the atmosphere, we ate in the parlor booth area which is clean enough and family-friendly but quite dated in appearance. We left through the adjoining room which is a bar that has been added on and is much more modern and was populated by locals drinking and eating dinner around the bar. I should also note that the plates for eating pizza are plastic. This is a ""no frills"" kind of place. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This is one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants. Or rather, it was. It recently changed hands and isn't as great as it used to be, apparently. I've only been the once, so I'll comment on my experience from this past week. The food was alright. Nothing special or spectacular. The tiramisu was short but quite strong, so that was a plus. The music was horrid. Terrible. And really loud and distracting. The restaurant was also quite cold. I was seating in front of a radiator and I still wanted to put my coat on by the time we had gotten our starters. As a whole, our party (5) enjoyed our meal, but it wasn't anything to rave about. I nice little place and lovely views - especially during the lighter seasons, I presume. But nothing to get too excited about. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Kabuto is, without a doubt and in my personal opinion, the best sushi restaurant in the United States. When the Michelin Guide returns to Las Vegas, this restaurant is worthy of multiple Michelin stars. You may search many places in many cities, but it is unlikely that you will find truly pure sushi like what you will find at Kabuto. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING that is served here melts in your mouth. The fish is to die for and I have often found that I am ruined after my meals that I have had here. There just isn't any other sushi restaurant that lives up to Gen-san's, short of spending thousands of dollars to fly to Ginza to eat at Sukiyabashi Jiro. Don't walk, run, and make reservations as soon as possible. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I started going once or twice a week, just to see if it's something I like. Now, I go 4-5 times a week and love it. The instructors are great, it's always a tough workout, and of course, I'm getting the results I hoped for. It's a great way to get a workout in an hour, be done for the day, and never get bored with that same old routine at the gym. Highly suggested. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Okay, I realize that I tend to give out a lot of 5 stars but this one is well deserved. I wish I had gotten the girl's name who helped me out as she deserves a raise. My grandmother passed away and we wanted to enlarge a photo of her to frame and put up at her memorial service. The best photo of her that we had was her high school graduation photo. She graduated from Chandler High in 1952. My cousin and I started out at a camera shop that blows up portraits for around $50. Although it was going to be expensive we both felt it was okay because it was for her memorial service. The guy behind the counter asked me for my copyright release. I stared at him for a moment and then said, ""Oh I don't have one, this is my grandmother's high school grad picture from the 50's and we're using the photo at her memorial service."" to which he replied, ""I'm sorry, but without the release we cannot enlarge this photo for you."" I told him that there had been a big fire and a lot of the old paperwork including my Grandmother's high school records had been lost (which is true), but also probably any records about who even took the high school senior photos at that time. He sent me away apologizing but being quite abrupt. I left completely angry and in tears because A - I just lost my Grams, who was like a mom to me, and B - the memorial was in less than a week and if every photo shop was going to ask for a copyright release, we were in trouble. I looked over and noticed Kinkos and thought, ""Heck, I'll just go blow up the photo myself and see if it looks okay."" We drove over and once inside noticed that it was a smaller Kinkos and we may not be able to blow it up ourselves. I asked hesitantly if the girl behind the counter could enlarge the photo for me. Not only did she say absolutely but she edited the photo a bit on her computer to remove a note my Grams had written to her grandparents on the front corner of it so that the photo would look nice in the frame at the memorial. I'm pretty sure they would have charged me an arm and leg to do the same thing at the camera shop. She said that they don't worry about copyrights on photos for memorial services since we were not going to be selling them or anything. She also noted that since over 50 years had passed you don't really need a copyright to reprint family photos of this nature. She took the small high school photo and enlarged it to fit in a 11x14 frame. Not only did it look beautiful at my Grams' memorial but it looks great in my kitchen today. To me, great staff=repeat business, period. I always do all my FedEx and copy business through this center. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This guys are so awesome. We went to 5 other mattress stores and they were, by far, the most amazing. We worked with Bobby - immediately he was NOT a greasy used car salesman. He was wonderful. He really explained the value of each mattress and what makes them wonderful. He worked within our price range and found a solution that worked for us. He was very knowledgable. Bobby also found us a financing plan that worked for us and made it happen very easily. Took us about 20 minutes to buy and get out the door. Not too bad. Beyond that, everyone in the store was very friendly. They were very welcoming. They have a TV and nice chairs and everyone is laughing and being friendly. We couldn't have had a better time. They also sell furniture sets and other things - just ask them. It's a great place. They also have high trad count sheets and protectors... All the good stuff. Go here. You won't be disappointed.

 Crusing around looking for a bathroom and something to eat... (cause and effect at it's worst) my mom didn't want to wait around for Original Hamburger Works to open, which sucks for me cuz I could just TASTE that burger!! :( oh well... we wound up going to First Watch... At first I was disappointed and then I was worried becuase that lil parking lot was FULL on a saturday late morning! We came into their very busy foyer and got seated very quickly... which surprised me becuase I was like.... ""ummm what about the other 20 people waiting for a table?"" But whatev' all's fair love and good tables at resturants. It took a LOOONG time for someone to even come up to us and ask for our drink order, but when we did - our waitress Sissy said she was brand spakin' new and was getting used to the ropes. I gotta admit, she was cool... she was patient and was willing to go ask the kitchen if the chicken salad had any onions in it... and it didn't btw - (yay!). So props for her on that. She even kept my mom's chickery spiced coffee aflowing and even got us some splenda for our drinks. I also have to mention that nothing on that menu is over $10! Score! Our food came and we were starved! I tore into my chicken salad and it was goooood... creamy, slightly sweet, nutty and chicken-y. I was in love. I wish it came with two pieces of toast instead of one, but I guess it's okay. The fruit salad was good, but I wish it were more seasonal... the maranated salad was okay too... a little too sweet for my taste. The potatos I had screamed onion powder! I tried to power through it but the taste was too strong. I couldn't finish it. My mom loved her spinach and tomato omlette and can't wait to try it again. Over all, we had a good time in the multi colored dining room in the middle of downtown... I left happy and not bogged down by a huge meal, which was nice. *sigh* brunch... it's what's missing from my day. To my yelpers: I say go. Atleast once. Go when you want what I call clean food... something nice that will sit well in your stomach and is a nice polite way to start the day... sooo not a good spot to nurse your hangover! lol! and don't worry about the loaded parking lot, just try it anyway and see what happens. you never know, you just might get seated right away like we were! :) ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've stayed here 4 times in a span of about 7 years. Same old dive each time, and I've returned each time mainly because of unbeatable cost, considering its prime location in the middle of the new strip. You know: save bundles on room, splurge on meals. With the last visit, however, I think I may have exhausted my patience and tolerance for the fact that they have always booked me in a smoking room every time I reserved a non-smoking room. And -- each time -- upon checking in, they insist that I reserved a smoking room. Customer service skills are non-existent here. They don't always service/clean the rooms daily. The rooms are about par with a C-grade Motel 6 and always leave at least one lasting memory. On my last visit, it was the greasy soiled fabric on the headboards. Lovely. Then they charge you $2 for the phone even if you never picked it up? WTF?? Is that now a universal thing with all the strip casino hotels? How Vegas indeed. That's it, I've had it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Was willing to stay in town, because hotels in Montreal on late notice can often be a bit dodgy. This place was located in a decent enough space that I can reach where I was trying to go, which is nice. Chinatown location was cool, too. I'm not as high maintenance as others, so don't really need a lot of frills when I stay at a hotel. The bed was very comfortable and the staff was extremely helpful throughout my stay to boot.

 This place served up one of the worst customer experiences I've ever seen a restaurant provide. We went in and although the place had plenty of seating it took them almost 20 minutes to seat 8 people. We told our waitress (who was really trying her hardest to keep up while her managers stood up at the bar and laughed) that we were in a hurry and put in our drink order. After close to 15 minutes we finally got our drinks and ordered up 5 rolls. Nothing special. We finally got the first one almost 40 minutes after that. Three of our party had to leave without eating. The food was very average. After that we asked for our check and again a long delay before we got our bill. We asked to speak to the manager about this and he finally came over another 15 minutes later. When we spoke to him about our experience he became extremely agitated and offered to pay for one of our rolls. I told him thanks but no thanks and I would just pay the bill. Then I informed him that this situation was obviously not our waitresses fault because the management was as bad as you'll find in this part of Scottsdale. As we were leaving he told us that he never wanted us to come back again. Absolutely AWFUL experience. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I went today for first time. Sat quickly, waited 15 minutes for water and sodas. Most of the food was barely warm, apple pie dough not cooked enough, shushi was ok, fried chicken good, crispy and hot. Noodles cold, deserts inimpressive, waitress never came by to ask if we needed anything, to busy chatting with each other. Didn't see any noodle-vegetable-meat combos. Broccoli by itself, chicken by itself, pork by itself, cold noodles by their self, etc. Could've used some Mongolian Beef or Chicken, Moo Goo Gai Pan, Pepper Steak, etc. They did have Snow Crab but they aren't worth the work.

 Been here a couple of times at night with friends, and I have to say there are better places for sushi. The price is decent for an AYCE sushi for $19.99, but the quality of fish is horrible. For people who are into nigiri sushi, this is not the place to be, the fish is cut super thin and accompanied by a lot of rice. The rolls are decent, and the other non-sushi items are pretty good. The one thing that I really didn't like about this place was the service. The servers would get our first order and then once you received your order it was hard to order again. There were times where we order nigiri and we would wait ten minutes, ask about it and then they would finally start making it. If you want a place for cheap AYCE sushi at night this is one place, but I would rather pay a lil bit more for better service and quality. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We tried the teriyaki chicken and Asian spicy chicken. Both were very good! If this was located a little closer to us, we'd definitely come back on a regular basis. Wide variety to choose from on the menu including crab puffs, edamame, etc. If I could rate 4.5 I would - the only downside is that it's small inside so not the most welcoming place to eat, but if you want something delicious on the go, this is it.

 This Fry's is better than most in terms of cleanliness and selection, and on the low end of the service scale.

 It's our first time in Vegas, and we wanted to see pen and teller. I got will call tickets and was stressed out about not sitting together, so we rushed to the rio. Because it was there we decided to eat at carnival. There was plenty of food, but it kinda sucked. My husband is a big boy, and he only got one plate of food if that tells you anything. I thought the prime rib was good., a little salty. I got a rancid crab leg (that made my hand smell the rest of the night no matter the soap) so that turned me off the crab. Sesame ball dim sum was the best thing I tried, oh and the menudo was the bomb. I didn't pay 30 bucks a pop though for seeds and tripe, so 2 stars. Save the cash and go somewhere else. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Have to give a shout out to this place. Although I have only gone to ""Cocktails"" a few times in the last few years, it will always have a special place in my heart. Flash back 25 years ago. My Dad used to take me here for happy hour with his work buddies. Some may say that isn't good parenting. Maybe its not. But I have very fond memories of sitting up at the bar getting my cheeks pinched by the bartender and the patrons. The nice, smoky voiced, wrinkly blond female bartender would put a zillion maraschino cherries in my shirley temple. And I would play darts with my Daddy. I feel warm and fuzzy just thinking about it. Once I would hit adulthood I would stop in every so often. Though my life was constantly changing this bar just felt like home. Another warm fuzzy memory? My brother proposed to his amazing wife here on New Years Eve a few years ago. I wasn't there at the time, but he text me pictures after the proposal. Great prices, great service, great memories. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This was my first visit to the M Hotel Spa Casino in Henderson, NV. We had a coupon for $10 off breakfast or lunch. They serve lunch until 5pm. There were 4 of us. We shared 2 entrees which was plenty of food with left overs. The Chicken Pot Pie was huge! It had large slices of carrots, chicken, peas, and broccoli, in a rich creamy gravy with a thick crust on top. It would have been enough for 4 people. The hamburger was 2 patties stuffed with avocado slices, bacon, and cheddar. The fries were crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. The side was extra. A cup of hot water cost $2.95. Service was minimal. We had to ask for a refill of water and To Go boxes. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Archie's is a Thai restaurant chain with locations convenient to both my work and home. I love their lunch specials for the good portions and value. I would recommend their Pad Thai lunch and Kung Pao chicken (better than Chinese kung pao). They serve consistently good Thai food with my only complaint being the spice number is not consistent. I've asked for spicy number 5s that may be more like a three on some days and like a nine on others. Yikes! But it's so good, I'll eat it anyway. I would suggest not getting the salads or the soups too spicy because the spice tends to overwhelm these dishes. Better to add more spice later than be sorry. Besides the lunch specials, a few other favorite dishes of mine are the Panang curry, Massaman curry and Tom Kha Gai soup. If in season, try the mango and sticky rice for dessert. Love it!

 Second visit and I see what I was missing.... It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say ""lite slaw"" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. $10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation. ",0,0,0,0,1

 The atmosphere is warm and pleasant. Nice patio with heaters if it's even a little cool. Lots of plants outside and a nice fireplace in the main dining room. The crowd tends to be on the mature side. The service is good and friendly, 7 out of 10. The food is pricey. The wine list is extensive, but possibly the most overpriced. Try the $20 wine sampler - 3 half glassesof your choice. The lobster bisque was a little bitter for my taste but my petite wife loved hers and finished mine. The $45 new york strip was ordered medium rare and came out medium, same is true for my wife's beef tenderloin. The presentation was very nice. Despite it being overcooked, it was delicious with a good medley of flavors. Overall, it was good but I'd go elsewhere for the money. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I went there last night with bf to celebrate our anniversary. After pre-yelp, we knew what to expect as to prices, so it wasn't so much of a shocker. To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasn't too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastro's is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that. For main course, I got Ivory Salmon ""Oreganata"", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes ""surpassed expectation."" I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course. Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge. Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers' reviews. Total worth it!!! The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again. We didn't order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate ""Happy Anniversary"" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasn't very good and it got loud. Didn't see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room. And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of ""expense account"" people though ",0,0,0,0,1

 BLUE MARTINI! I believe happy hour is from 6-8. Half off all food and drinks!

 Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. We stood around a little awkwardly when we got there since we didn't know if we should seat ourselves or wait for someone. After a while we just sat ourselves. They have free peanuts at all of the tables which was perfect since I was really hungry. I opted for the half sandwich and half salad. I went with the meatball sandwich since it's been a while since I had one. The salad is nothing special, just a simple side salad. The sandwich was really good, no complaints here. The bread was perfectly toasted too. It was kind of annoying having to swat pesky flies away while you're trying to eat. My bill was just a little under $10 which seems high to me for what I got. They have a dog friendly patio which is pretty cool but I can't imagine having to sit outside while it's hot out, even if it did mean getting to eat with your pup. They had a ton of TV screens which is great if you're trying to catch a game. College football was on and there was a big group of Nebraska fans there catching the game. I think service here can be hit or miss. Our waitress wasn't bad, a little slow at times but we weren't in a rush. I noticed that the table next to us was sitting for a while before they got a menu in their hands or was given any attention. I think they sat themselves too. I did notice a family who came in that did get seated. Maybe they were short staffed? I wouldn't be opposed to coming back here but it wouldn't be my first choice. I'm rarely in the Chandler area anyway. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I love love love the ambiance of the restaurant. It is fun and funky, great youth for Gilbert! The margaritas are great and you can't really mess up chips and salsa! Having worked in restaurants for 6 years, I have probably sent food back less than 5 times in my life. Joyride would be one of those times. Very bland carne asada. Management was great in offering me something else and giving me coupons for my next visit - I really appreciate the customer service. So basically, I will go back, but I will stick to drinks and apps :) ",0,1,0,0,0

 Customer service has always been nice to me on purchases; I haven't ever tried returns there. Selection is iffy. We recently went there for shower curtain liners and they only had one size, that was about six inches too long and two holes shy of fitting a standard shower/tub setup in a standard house. And if you're looking for food, the frozen pizza selection isn't very good either. I try to avoid shopping at Target whenever possible because they pay their employees less than Walmart, and the only people I know who do work or have worked there in the past said it was not a good work environment. Try to spend your money in places that treat their employees well. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I would never recommend Chuck E Cheese at 7381 Lake Mead, Las Vegas NV. I just had my son's birthday party at Chuck E Cheese and it was so disorganized. I hope that my guests did not realize it. The party hostess was friendly at first, she got our orders for the kids pizza and adult pizzas. She said, okay i have that you are having 14 kids. I looked at her with a startled expression and said, no I am having 20 kids. She looked at the plates on the table and was like ""oh I guess I could of looked at all those plates"". I was like, what have I got myself into. There were clearly 20 plates on the table, but she didn't have the correct information. I never saw the party hostess around until the manager saw me getting my own pitchers and I asked for more plates. I had to fill up my own pitchers after they were empty. The tables weren't cleaned off to the very end. I was surprised the cake was ready for the ""Big Chuck E Cheese"" show. The other ""party host / hostess"" seemed more attentive to their guests vs. my party hostess. I am not sure if she just didn't care or if she was overwhelmed with the 20 + kids we had. I have had my kid's birthday parties at other facilities (Child's Play, Laser Tag, Sky zone etc) and those experiences were wonderful. The other party host at (Child's Play, Laser Tag, Sky zone, etc) were always around or if they needed to go on break there was always someone else around. Another thing was the ""ticket blaster"", she never explained the ticket blaster, that my son FINALLY went in. She said, oh did he already do the ticket blaster and I was like no I was waiting for you. She said, oh that (and she pointed) party host is doing the ticket blaster. By that time, I just gave up on the party host. I took my son to the other hostess who was wonderful. i always give a $50.00 tip to my party hostess/host but she received a $10.00. I don't even think she deserved that. The only thing she seemed to be on top of was handing me the bill. I would never recommend Chuck E Cheese on Lake Mead in La's Vegas. ",1,0,0,0,0

I said sure. 20 minutes later we were done eating and she said ohhhh u ordered another beer. I said just bring the check. She brought the check and never returned to collect payment. My boyfriend finally got up and ask someone to cash us out. The app was never taken off however that was the least of out worries. Bummed that the sucked.

 I'm not all that much of a girly girl, but I will say this: I've learned one of the most important relationships in your life is with your hair stylist. So imagine my devastation when mine moved away 5 years ago. If you've ever had to search for a new salon, you know it's not easy. It's hard to trust a stranger with your hair. (And if you've ever had a bad experience.. it's just that much harder. TWSS) My friend Emilee recommended her stylist: Erica at Salon 42 (the Dilworth location). Emilee has more hair than anyone else I know... so I figured hey, if she can tame that lovely blonde head of hair... she can do anything. :) Erica does a great job. She takes the time for a thorough consultation before pulling out the scissors and dye. I trust her completely and always leave happy. I also recommend Corey. My entire group of girlfriends now go here. I'm pretty sure Emilee's weekly trips are what pays their electric bill. The prices are comparable to other salons in Charlotte. If you book an appointment.. tell them Nikki sent you! ",0,0,0,1,0

 My first (of many) Cirque du Soleil shows. Absolutely jaw dropping! Most of the negative reviews focus on a ""lack of"" or ""confusing"" plot. At the end of the day this show is still ""cirque"" as in ""circus"". Of all the Cirque shows I've seen this one has the most coherent ""plot"", but if you want a proper 3 Act show, go to the movies. These kind of shows are about the feeling evoked and the artistry and spectacle performed. That said, Ka delivers above and beyond. I had frequent instances where I held my breath in excitement and strong dash of fear. The Good: World class acrobatics, stunts, and show moments. The Bad: Its not cheap! That said, I've sat in the upper landing and they're not BAD, seats. That said I would recommend center section, at least 5 rows back if you can.

 We went to Top Shelf because we had a coupon from our Entertainment book for a buy one, get one free entree. When we got to the restaurant, we hung out in the waiting area for a few minutes before the hostess came to seat us, but we enjoyed looking at the fish tank while we waited. Our waitress was nice and kept our drinks filled and the food was pretty good, but maybe a little pricey for the portions. When the bill came, we gave the waitress our coupon. She brought back the bill and our kid's meal was the one given to us free. When we asked, she said she tried to give us the second adult entree as the free meal, but the manager wouldn't let her. She then had the manager come talk to us, but he wouldn't budge on the matter. I have never been to a restaurant that considers a kid's meal to be an entree.

 We went on a Sunday and they were advertising on a sign out front Happy Hour (Porky Hour) half price appetizers and drink specials. The pricing for specials was confusing to the point where the staff could only charge certain prices depending on where the hostess seated you in the restaurant. That was confusing and pretty stupid. 3 star management, but 4 star service. Our waitress kicked ass. And of course, 4 stars for the delicious food! We had the Redneck Tacos, which were a perfect combo, and a meal for one by themselves. Great big portions! We split a 4 Meat Platter and it comes with 2 sides and their 3 kinds of BBQ sauce. The brisket was perfectly cooked medium rare. The ribs were good but a little overcooked. The chicken breast was good, but on the dry side. Sauce made up for that well enough. Last meat was the pulled pork, same as comes on the Redneck Tacos, which was just perfectly tender and flavorful. At $20 it was a good deal and we had plenty of leftovers for the next day's lunch. Porkopolis lived up to its name with its pork. We'll be returning to this restaurant with the hopes that they work out a few of the start-up kinks.. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Yes it's fast food, but that doesn't mean you won't be able to taste something exquisite. For a dollar, you get two tacos that are like nothing else you will find (now I see what all the fuss is about). But if you really want to try something that you weren't expecting to be unbelievable, you'll want to try their Spring Rolls. I recommend getting the three pack because these are the best spring rolls money can buy. They're perfectly crunchy on the outside, and the most moist feeling I've ever had in a spring roll.

 I'm torn with this review because Crudo used to be my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix til the last time we went with a group of 8. In the past, the drinks & food have all been phenomenal. Loved the crispy pig ears, all the crudo plates (since I love raw fish!), and their squid ink risotto was delish. A great space too. The last time we went though was a major fail on the food. The drinks still held up strong (thus the 3 stars), but the crispy pig ears were soggy & super oily, and the raw fish smelled & tasted horrible. How could you serve unfresh fish raw? If you know the fish ain't good, don't offer it. Or change the menu and cook the fish so I can't tell that you're serving me fish you got last week. Because of these bad dishes we were served (which was kind of embarrassing since I was the one who suggested to everyone we eat at Crudo), I don't think any of us want to go back. This was in early summer and we haven't been back since. Sorry Crudo - you seemed to have loosened up your quality control there. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Let me start off by saying this review is for people who don't particularly like Asian cuisine, but are forced to come here due to some type of obligation. The place is decked out in bright red Asian decor, with a lit up waterfall flowing in the background. I came here with a group celebrating an important occasion, and the guest of honor chose this place. I was a little skeptical after hearing the name, but there was plenty here for those who don't enjoy this type of food. Even though we were seated for teppanyaki style dining, I ordered the Angus Beef Sirloin and Black Truffle Teriyaki with fried rice. The black truffle and teriyaki sauce added a very good flavor to what was a pretty ordinary piece of meat. Also, I didn't think rice could be this good: adding eggs and seasoning to it, really made this side a nice surprise. While I was a little shocked at first about the prices, the decor and the chef's performance at the table helped to ease my pain....The delicious food helped too. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place was really good. A little pricey, every time we ordered something shed put in one number which was on the menu and then add a few more cents-a dollar which was kinda shady since we actually removed stuff from what we wanted (no sour cream, no cheese etc) The staff was not friendly. I talked to two girls neither one even spoke except to tell me my total, or that our order was ready. The chips were pretty expensive $3 something but really tasty. Salsa selection sucked. They have one red and one green both liquids, no chunky salsa or any other kind, just super hot red saucy stuff and green saucy stuff. There were a lot of other condiments, there were green onions, radishes, cucumbers jalape \ u00f1os, and carrots. Overall I really liked this place and I'm glad we found it and that its 24hrs!

 Russell is the kind of business owner that makes you feel at home in his restaurant. At home as in giving you the TV remote to change the channel, bringing you boiled peanuts when you politely decline (and then letting you take the peanuts home because you didn't finish them) and chatting with you when things have calmed down for him. And it certainly doesn't hurt that the food is delicious as well! During my visits I've gotten three banchan: radish, kimchi and bean sprouts. All of it delicious, all of it hard to not ask for refills; gotta save room for the entrees! I've had the Dolsot Bibimbap and the Fish Jun. The Bibimbap delivers well, and the Fish Jun portion is huge! Two very large filets battered and fried. Not only was Russell generous with the fish, he also kept offering to bring me more rice when he saw I had eaten it all!

 I've been here twice, first time got the wonton soup, which was pretty decent. Nothing too special or fancy though we did have a question of if they were using the microwave to heat food up.

It was pretty good, the noodles were cooked just right (at least for me), it wasn't too spicy just enough to taste it, and the beef was very tender (it came apart very easily!). I believe it was $7.99 for that. My friend got the beef and tendon, spicy, and with thick noodles as well. I believe he liked it as well. Well it wasn't bad for either of us, so that's a plus.

 I see there are a lot of mixed reviews about this place... Anyhow, I liked the Cheeseburger a lot. Being a vegetarian, I was hesitant at first to eat here. However, my friends and I had been walking around Planet Hollywood and we were starving. It was either the Cheeseburger or the other options (La Salsa, etc.), which didn't sound too great. On top of that, the boys that were with us really wanted burgers. First of all, I was shocked to see how large the menu was. They have a very wide variety of burgers here. And another plus, they had not only one, but two vegetarian options (the usual GardenBurger and a Tofu Burger). I had ordered the Tofu Buger and it was DELICIOUS! My friends had mushroom and swiss burgers, which they all loved. I thought the burgers were very tasty and BIG. Aside from the burgers though, the chilly cheese fries weren't that good. So i don't know about their sides.. But the burgers were great. I like places that can make a good veggie burger, and they did it right here.

 The venue was a little difficult to locate because the sign is a bit cluttered with their unusually long name. Just look for an Italian flag and bellissimo! You've found it. The inside has a modern interior with a bar at the front by the chefs. I don't recall seeing sushi on the menu, but I feel like it's a nice touch that pays homage to a typical Japanese restaurant. The import beer was nice. I recommend the red rice hitachino. A different take than your average kirin. The bread rolls they give you as wait weren't anything specular but we really enjoyed it, we asked for a second serving ha! I ordered a salmon fettuccine with ikura and it was a pleasant surprise. I never would've guessed that pasta with a Japanese touch would taste so good. The appetizers are good but nothing out of the ordinary. The jidori chicken is similar to a regular karage chicken served with salad. The calamari was decent but the portions are pretty small. Two things I would return for are the beer and pasta. I wish that I ordered two plates of pasta instead of one dish and appetizers. In my opinion, skip the appetizers and head straight for the pasta with a side of beer. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I don't really mind dive places because there are times that they have really good food. The place is dated and could use updating. The waitress was good. I think she knew we weren't all that pleased with our food even though we told her it was good. The food....my daughter-in-law had the shrimp scampi. We are pros at making our own at home, but when it was served, I told her that there are variations to it. Her first bite she made a sour face. My son and I then tasted it...understood the face after that. Way too much lemon juice in it, soaked in oil and not quite sure what the seasoning was, but seemed like pesto. The pasta was overcooked and the shrimp just sort of were there. My son and I had the fried seafood platter. Aside from overcooked breading and soaked in grease, the oysters were raw, and the battered fish had no flavor. The breaded shrimp tasted weird too. Needless to say, none of us finished our food. Underneath the food, the plate had a puddle of grease. On the upside, the coleslaw, bread, and crab cake was good. The make and cheese was edible, but seemed to comparable to Stauffer's. This was our first, and more than likely, our last, visit. For a $65 dollar meal, it wasn't worth $10. . ",0,1,0,0,0

 Overall rating is 1.5 stars out of 5. When my wife and arrived at our hotel in Vegas on 05/16/13 we were quite hungry and ready for lunch. After a brief discussion we decided, we would get our bags situated in our room first and then head to this restaurant mainly because of it's proximity and because our stomachs talking to us lol. When we arrived at the entrance we were immediately greeted by the hostess and quickly escorted to our seats (So far so good). Now here is where it starts to go down hill (Just a mental reminder that this place was not busy at all during this time). Ok so my wife and I sat at the table for well over 20 minutes before a guy finally arrived and asked us our drink orders. We quickly told him what we wantef to drink because by this time we already knew what we wanted for lunch. When I proceeded to tell him what we wanted to order he said, ""Your server will be with you shortly"" (Well that was a bold face lie). After about 5 minutes the guy brings out our drinks and some bread with butter for us to eat. This bread was awful and its not so much because of taste but more so because the outer part of the bread was hard like rocks. So we thought we could bypass that by eating the soft inside which we found out was not even room temperature this bread was cold. So we ended not eating the bread. I say about another 20-25 minutes later our server arrives to take our order (FINALLY!). After finally placing our order (The Paris Burger w/ Fries) that took another 15-20 minutes to finally get delivered to our table. The good thing is that when the food finally came it was pretty good. The fries were pretty good and I like how the top bum of the burger was cooked. The edge of the buns had a crispy texture while the rest of the bun still remained sofT. Overall the burger was not life changing but still a decent burger and the fries were good as well. In the end the reason for the low rating is because service was extremely SLOW and the bread was not good at all either (Some people might like that but not me). The sad thing is that this place seems to be packed with people later in the evening however because of this experience I do not think I'll be coming back to this until maybe my next trip to Vegas. There are just too many restaurants and places to explore to be fixated on this one. Maybe next time Le Cafe. Hey maybe you guys might have better look with service. Good Luck. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Items Ordered: Sliced Brisket, Pulled Pork, Spare Ribs, Cornbread Mac n' Cheese Sweet Potato Fries Biscuit ""New Orleans"" French Toast with Sliced Bananas Banana Pudding Red Velvet Cake Praline Located near Norm's Eggs Caf \ u00e9 in a strip mall off South Durango and featuring ""World Famous"" ribs with awards in 2007 and 2010 for the city's best barbeque it was with tempered expectations that I entered TC's Rib Crib and although I will say the Motown soundtrack and service were quite pleasant as I watched the Buckeyes obliterate Kent State, little else of my experience was even remotely good - a small, buttery biscuit and a jumbo praline the lone exception. Obviously the sort of place willing to cut corners as condiments include Aunt Jemima and 'honey' cut with glucose syrup and starch it was in a wide selection of meats, sides, and sweets that I invested and although costs were quite low for most items, so too was the quality - the ribs clearly parboiled without a note of smoke while thinly sliced brisket and pulled pork were nearly indistinguishable beneath artificially saccharine sauce. Mostly ignoring bland elbow noodles from which I consumed only a few bites and fries that arrived almost at meal's end as well as the $4.50 French Toast was flat and flavorless even with the $1.50 banana and whipped cream upgrade...the latter not supplied as they were apparently 'out'...and moving on to dessert, suffice it to say that the boxed vanilla pudding with only a hint of banana beneath 'nilla wafers is not worth $5.99 and although the frosting on a tiny sliver of red velvet cake was tangy and smooth the cake was so dry it literally crumbled to fork pressure - the majority of it joining nearly half the rest of my order in a waste basket when servers were otherwise occupied so as not to offend. Literally the only patron present just past noon on a Saturday it is shocking to me that a business like TC's can sustain and as much as I try to support locals I cannot fathom a reason to return, particularly given a pricepoint higher than Rollin' Smoke despite quality on par with Famous Dave's.

 This is hands down the most thrilling ride on the Stratosphere, beating out the kinda boring SkyJump by far as well as the stupidly glorified ""merry-go-round"" called Insanity and the barely okay X-Scream. I love how it's not just a drop tower, but it reverses the speedy vertical movement.... you shoot up fast (just 45 miles per an hour but going up that speed is a very different sensation than going down that speed which would be kind of boring) so that you feel some weightlessness and then you drop down fast and continue this movement 3 times or so but at shorter lengths. The fact that the ride is on top of the Stratosphere did not make a difference in the thrill to me because you have a whole lot of ground on top of the building to see that detracts from the fact that you're up so high. Plus, I don't think it would matter much otherwise. This ride would be just as good on ground level. Overall, it's a good ride that just barely makes it 4 stars. It's more like a 3.5 stars, but I rounded it. It could always be much bigger, faster, and not shorten the additional bouncing so much. But then, it would probably scare off too many other people, and they wouldn't have nearly as much business. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place is great. I like the laid back atmosphere and the fact that the offer groupons and deals frequently. The food has always been good, the drinks are gigantic (which is great because I like a lot to drink with my meals), and the service is always pleasant and consistent. My only complaint is that sometimes it's way too loud and I can barely have a conversation with my boyfriend across the table. The place is family friendly so there's always a lot of kids screaming/crying/dropping things and the TVs when football is on are sometimes loud. ",0,0,0,0,1

 NEVER AGAIN. So I was here the other day and I ordered a sandwich that had two different kinds of meat on it (#5 Vito). Instead of salami, I wanted turkey. Pretty simple right? Take one meat away and add a different one. When she told me the total it seemed about $2 too high. When I looked at the reciept I noticed they charged me $2 for the turkey? Wait...I took one meat away and subbed turkey...there's a charge for that?!?! Apparently so. I'm not sure I understand the philosphoy behind this, but I don't agree with it and I'll never eat there again. Only makes sense that if you take one meat away you should be able to sub another for no additional charge. I was told that their sandwiches are made a certain way to assure speed and accuracy. Does reaching down into the turkey bin instead of the salami bin really affect speed that much? Come on! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Horrible airline. Flight was delayed by 45 minutes. Employees at the counter could get a personality. Pilot could not decide if he needs to turn left or right during flight.

 We had dinner in the bar. The bartender was great but the food was horrible. The salad was soggy and old. The salmon was not fresh and topped with some kind of butter that likely was mixed with their branded dry seasonings. The potatoes were not cooked all the way through. My husband's steak had little flavor. The tea water was warm and tasted of coffee. A definite waste of $200. We brought the left overs home for the dogs and then threw them in the garbage in the end.

 *FIRST TIME REVIEW FOR VDARA* i arrived here for my stay at Vdara for the 8/8/12-8/10/12..i sure wouldve stayed an extra day if it didnt cost me a whole body or two to stay here! my bf and i drove to vegas and when we first got here, we were a bit confused at their valet system because the roads were a lil weird since they share it with Aria. but we got the hang out of it, right when we got our of car..we were imediately greeted and offered for bell hop service. we politely declined and moved onto the lobby. front desk- i got here around 2pm (since that is the check in time for several hotels) so i guess that would be a reason why the line was going really slow to check in. but NO, it was because they only had TWO employees/ladies working the frront desk and had two needy ass couples they had to dealt with. so the line i was in which did have 3 people waiting to check in (including myself) turned into 12 people in line! you would think they would call for back up or something. no they didnt..they did have a random guy in the front desk area who had glasses on with a caramel complexion just walking back and front and doing nothing. i didnt get it. front desk was a breeze after 25 mins waiting in line. i had to ask for my complimentary buffet tickets (which i wish i didnt have to because it should be a given) and the weird thing was usually every hotel ive been at usually asks if i would like to upgrade my room..they didnt, but if they did i think i wouldve. $$ lost for them and btw $25 for resort fees each night PLUS an extra $3 resort tax to it each day as well. total $56 bucks! yes, its ridiculous! the room- we got the standard deluxe suite and the room was amazingly clean. i loved the dark wood decor and modern feel to it. i was a little bit dissapointed in the size of the room. i mean, i knew it was their standard room but i wouldve just called it a deluxe room instead of a suite...prb because it had a mini kitchen thats why they had to call it a suite? LOL. we did use their kitchen to save money on us buying food out on the strip, their fridge SUCKS in size/space!!! i mean cmon why give us a kitchen if we cant store the food we bring in it. it was like the depth of a boot size shoe box. i had to sit on the floor and reconfigure every container of meat i brought so the door can close! their electric stove IS amazing though...i dont why there wasnt any dish soap or even a place to hang your dry dishes after you washed them..so i had to improvise by using their bathsoap to wash. the bathroom was on the small size in my opinion but every amenity in there was a great. we used the bathtub - which was a decent size and the shower can fit two people but it was smaller than what i was used to. the countertop/sink area was on the small size for me as well..i had to move their vdara products and bath dishes to my bf's side because it was so small for me to put all of my bath necessities there. the view was great and the bed was probably THE MOST AMAZING BED i ever slept on. my bf and i would be so damn tired from the day/night's events and when we woke up the next day -we were def refreshed and none of our muscles ached! the hotel itself- vdara doesnt tolerate any smoking nor does it have a casino. at first i thought it wouldnt be a problem but since my bf and i do like to gamble here and there..it wouldve been nice to gamble inside of our own hotel. although it was a nice change and i could see vdaras view on why they did so. we didnt mind walking to aria or bellagio to gamble and eat anyways. i didnt see why people were complaining about the walk from vdara to the strip...youre gonna walk everywhere and for a good amount of distrance anyways! vdara didnt have a great selection or should i say nearly any resturant/food options..they had a lil market area but that place was so overpriced than usual vegas prices...because it was organic and all the natural fancy nancy foods haha. so my bf and i just ate at aria or any other close by estashblishments. would i stay here again or not? - most likely not, although i did enjoy the convience of the location and modern amaneties..it didnt live up to some of the cons i had for this hotel. i think im more drawn and spoiled from my last stay at cosmopolitan. i would probably stay next door to Aria since it did have the ameneties i was looking for and etc;or back to cosmo.

 This is strictly for how they operate their ""Call Ahead"" seating. Their food is usually impeccable. I will never understand their stupid call ahead, maintain two list, absurd process. I called ahead at 6:50 pm. Was told the wait was 40 min. Great as I would be there in 40 min so I had my name placed on the list. Got there at 7:30 and they couldn't find my name. So they put my name on the ""call ahead"" list and told about 30 min wait while they were on a 1 hour wait at this point (exactly why I called ahead). Talked to the ""manager"" (really just the key server) and she said they did have my name on the ""call ahead"" list and my wait would be about 30 min. That the ""call ahead"" list just shortens your wait to about half the current wait. Really? And just how do they go about calculating this? My wife has worked for Outback for over 6 years and says that system is still as screwed up as when they first introduced it. Here's a novel idea, when someone calls, just put their name on the list! If they're not there when called, skip them, just as if they showed up in person. Really not that hard and you don't have to maintain two separate lists forever trying to explain your logic in doing so to customers. The truth is, Outback really doesn't care about this system. They're always on a wait so no big deal if customers don't like it and go home. It just reduces the wait time. So we left and went across the street to Gordon Biersch. That's another review.

 So my usual nail technician moved to California!!! NOOOOOO!!!! Has my world collapsed?!?! Fear not, Furama Nails is just down the road and is FANTASTIC! It's in the same shopping strip as the Safelite call center and has plenty of parking. I walked in with no appointment on a Monday afternoon and was immediately taken care of (no surprise there). The interior is beautiful and clean. I got a basic mani just to test the waters with it being my first new nail place in 5 years. They were very gentle with my unruly cuticles, no bleeding. The hand massage was a tad short, but maybe I was just spoiled with my previous tech. My nails looked fantastic for the week, no chipping, my nails didn't dry out or tear. I will definitely be back for a pedi and gel mani. They also have a rewards card for each time you go. Can't remember the details, but a discount for loyalty is something I will always take advantage of. ",0,0,0,0,1

For a person to approach my door in that state with food... How can this be? He is in the restaurant picking up the food to deliver.. Do the other employees and owners not smell this?

 Thai Elephant is our hands down favorite Thai food in the valley.

As others have commented, the food presentation is Outstanding.

 Wow, people are really hard on this restaurant as if they were authentic thai chefs themselves...just kidding! I've recently become a really big fan of thai food, although I've been a HUGE fan of pad thai for quite some years now. After seeing that the Lotus of Siam was on the food network, I knew I had to give it a try. I've been there about 4 or 5 times now and have been satisfied every time. I mean, it wasn't THE best thai I've had, but I can see why everyone's raving about it. Next time, try to be a little brave and order a little something from each category and try it out...you won't be sorry. I started talking to the waitress and she said that the reason why the food was so fresh is that they make a trip to LA TWICE a week to get fresh ingredients for their dishes. TWICE A WEEK!

 I thought this place was going to be so much better than it actually was. It was ranked the best steakhouse in Las Vegas on a few sites and now I wonder if those sites were sponsored by Carnevino. It is a nice restaurant with great service. I tried the dry aged bone in ribeye, mashed potatoes, and beef cheek ravioli. We were warned the steak was a bit rarer than usual and what would usually be ordered medium-rare should be ordered medium. We took that advice and ordered the steak medium but it came out pretty much rare. The mashed potatoes were ok. I LOVED the beef cheek ravioli though, that was amazing. If you want a great flavorful steak with a nice crust, go to Wolfgang Puck's Cut instead. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Nice people; able to get my car in for an appointment fairly quickly; able to perform a full service that many would not do; decent rates; and seemed like there was no problem with integrity. However, wrong diagnosis for auto repair. Basically, as I was purchasing a car in the Mesa area, I brought the used vehicle here for a pre-purchase inspection. And the diagnosis I received for several issues with some noise was - well This looked ok, so maybe you could try this first, and then try this. We're not sure. I took the car somewhere else later to get everything that needed done done, and was told, umm, no, This is the problem. They fixed said problem, and it solved all of it. I would assume that they drove my car here at Triple A to get a feel for the issue, so maybe even then they just couldn't figure it out. (Again, nice people, but I need to know what actually needs to be serviced, not just start throwing darts.) Maybe they did not in fact drive it to see.

 The best kept secret in Henderson! Moderately expensive and definitely worth every penny you spend. If you are looking for typical Mexican food you have come to the wrong place. This is reasonably priced fare for a slightly more sophisticated palate. Sabor provides you with culinary masterpieces that create a whole new experience for your taste buds. I have been five times in two months and have thoroughly enjoyed each entree I've tried. While I have my favorites (the Chicken Poblano has an amazing flavor that you simply cannot forget) my wife prefers the Blackened Arrachera. The food at Sabor creates more of a dining experience, one that you will cherish, rather than just satisfying your appetite. The chef, Scott, definitely knows what he is doing and the waiters and other staff are both efficient and friendly. Do yourself a favor, this is a dining experience that you will usually have to travel to a five star resort restaurant and it's tucked away in a quiet corner of Henderson. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Pretty cool spot, but as previously mentioned, it can get super packed. Forget about getting a table for high profile games ... and getting a table on a Saturday or Sunday during football season ain't gonna happen! Luckily we flew in to Vegas around 4:00 on a Thursday, so we were basically grabbing dinner since we were still on east coast time. The only action going on was a divisional playoff baseball game, so it wasn't too crowded. They have stadium seating (hence the name of the restaurant), so almost impossible for anyone to be in your way while watching the multiple big screens on the wall. That didn't affect us anyway, as we sat on leather couches/benches in a lounge area that had its own personal television. The only downside was that they supposedly accommodate 6 to 8 people, but give you a small slender table meant to hold food for about 3 people. This was not acceptable considering we had drinks, a couple appetizers, silverware, and eventually the entrees. One other thing to mention about this place ... alongside the big screens were current betting odds, which was kinda cool. Service was ""mehhh"" ... they weren't very attentive to refills, requesting extra napkins, extra ketchup, etc. As for the meal, not a great selection of beers, but they did have a few ""beer bucket"" specials. The reason for three (3) stars instead of two (2) is striclty based on the pretzel and beer cheese ... yum. My entree (pastrami sandwich) and side of onion rings were rather average ... good, but average. My Quick and Dirty review: Atmosphere - Pretty cool (other than the tiny tables used in the lounge area seating) Service - Poor Food - Average (except pretzel & beer cheese, which was exquisite) Summary - Good spot if you want to keep track of 4+ sporting events, but I enjoyed the Public House more. They are a short walk down towards the Venetian ... better menu, better drink selection, and more comfy seating. Fewer TVs, but if you grab a seat at the bar (or lounge area), it's easy to settle in.

Can't really taste the fois gras, taste like salted potatoes added to the pork. OK, not terrific Rossejat...angel hair pasta pealla with prawns. This is my favorite dish. It's like angel hair pasta that's been cooked with prawn soup base. A steal @ $15Yummy for my tummy. For dessert we had the flan. Very smooth texture.

 I have 2 words for you, Freaking Fantastic!!! I have stayed in countless hotels across the US and most are boring without any character. This place is quite the contrary. The Graduate has this fun Hipster-College-Americana vibe. I absolutely loved it. I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights, so I got to know the ins and outs of this place. The rooms are extremely clean and comfortable. The staff are very nice and helpful. And their restaurant, The Normal Diner, had great service and really good food. I will be back! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I am not a fan of Kona Grill and it really baffles me as to why this place is always so packed. They do have a lot of items on their menu that sound great but I feel like the quality of the food is very hit or miss. The same with the service from the waitstaff in the dining area. The bartenders can definitely mix up some good cocktails and they have a great patio but the sushi they serve at Happy Hour is awful - not well prepared and tastes like it has been sitting out for a while. I guess out of the choices available nearby it is not a bad place in comparison. I would definitely rather go here than Cheescake Factory or that new Old Spaghetti Factory (horrible!) but there are a lot better places out there once you escape the confines of the mall.

 First impressions are great in their first hour of business. Super cool, totally radical atmosphere, dude. Very Pacific Beach style motif. Walls adorned with surf and skate gear photos and lamps. Lots of surf gear sponsorship hung around in here. Ordered a spicy and mild fish taco and both were equally flavorful and delicious. Brown rice was done right and their Cajun beans were not bad at all. Of course everything was kicked up a notch when I squeezed my lime wedge on everything. Everything came as expected and enjoyed my meal in the outdoor seating area. Look forward to come back in the near future and patronize their full service bar. Thanks Wahoo for the opening day schwag! ",0,0,0,1,0

 If you're looking for a restaurant that has ambience, music, nice lighting and gives you a feeling of being welcomed, don't come here. The prices are not cheap enough to warrant such crappy customer service. And if you're looking for great quality food at affordable prices don't come here either. The food is mediocre at best. This is a walk up to the counter and order. And when your order is ready they simply just yell ""order ready"" The atmosphere is reminiscent of a sad Mexican prison. In short, I would not recommend this place ",1,0,0,0,0

 When they see my car...oh jeez...here she is again...how much vodka do her friends drink in a week???? This is the only place I can find Jewel of Russia Ultra...it is about $80 a bottle..seriously ..the best $80 you could ever..ever spend! The bottles are all hand painted in porcelain(?)..It makes a stunning gift!

 Great value - I ate my heart out and paid 35 dollars including tip. Same meal would probably be 50 bucks in Los Angeles. This place is ran by Japanese people and I found their stuff is more authentic than most. I'm sick of places that has random ppl making sushi because they either: put too much rice in the nigiri..the rice is too sour or the fish cut is too thin/thick. Fish tastes relatively fresh...not the best but def. not the worst. I'd give it a 8/10. This still caters to the traditional Americans who want an assortment of rolls but for those that just want some good old nigiri - you can't beat this place. Place is relatively large so seating is pretty quick. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I'm rating this as an event venue. I've been here for two different events. And both were very different event types. One was a dinner and country entertainer. The tickets were a good value for the meal. It was a buffet style meal that included many options. The food was fresh and hot. Not like it had been sitting around for a while. The entertainment turned out to be wonderful. All in all, it was a great evening. The second event was a private party. The staff was on top of the set up and maintained everything thru out the evening. Appetizers were served that appealed to both the adults and kids. We had the entire place and it was very nice to be able to be outside on the patio. It's a pretty location for an event. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Lets first start off with , we eat mexican food 4 times a week , and the name of this place has nothing to do with mexican , should have guessed . This place is cute, severs are good, chips are good, hot sauce is good, but not chucky.. All that said the food looked good delivered , we all bite in and wow,no taste, blaned , , the cheese enchiladas was so bad couldnt eat them , cheese was melted , but the homemade wrappers under coked, black bean tasted like they opened a can of black beans and poured on the plate, not drained, no spicy, my husband refired beans the same way . We all three couldnt eat our meals , such a disappointment . I guess thats why happy Hour is from 11am-7pm My feelings are never go in unless your thirsty , not hungery. . So giving it a 1star is pushing it , and thats chips ",1,0,0,0,0

 Our flight was canceled because the airline failed in replacing the pilot. The pilot who was supposed to fill in to fly our flight refused to do so. It shows how poorly the airline manages the resource. The pilots must be pushed to work to their limit so that they cannot take another flight. Also they canceled the flight after they delayed it for 2 and half hours. When we were handled for an over-night accommodation, there was only a person at the ticket counter to re-book our flights and accommodations. They eventually added more people to help the process, but it took a looooooooooooooong time for us to get out of the airport. Then we were sent to a cheap and uncomfortable motel. The next morning, we found we had been re-booked to the same canceled flight of the previous day. I don't know how their computer system allows the employee to be able to do something like it. We were told there was a good chance to get on to the next morning flight. We went back to the airport only to find it was not true. Then they re-booked us to different flights, which we found out for ourselves. Finally they sent us to United and everything started to work out. I added a star because I try to think positively that we had a few extra hours to see more in LV after we went through all of this incident. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Remember that time back in college when you were so stoned at like 3 in the morning with a serious case of the munchies? And the only thing you could find in the frat house refrigerator was a bag of frozen french fries that had been in there since your freshman year. But being desperate, you threw them in the oven at 500 degrees ('cause you just couldn't imagine waiting 15 minutes to eat). And then you burned yourself on the pan when you pulled them out, but you were too stoned to feel the pain (although you were quite certain you were going to feel it in the morning). Do you remember how, after just a few bites of what might just be the nastiest thing you ever ate, you threw them in the garbage and thought to yourself, ""What's the use? What's the point to all of this? Why do I even bother? Why do I even go on"" And when you woke up late the next afternoon, you went straight down to the registrar's office and changed your major to philosophy. Then you started getting drunk and smoking pot every night with that long-haired old guy who hangs out at the bar, the guy who never showers and always hits on the freshmen girls who sneak in on the weekends; only to find yourself dropping out of college a few months later because you just couldn't disseminate the intellectual struggle between being and nothingness, and your professors were just too stupid to understand you. And now, 20 years later, you're living back home in your parents house, unable to keep a job and drinking away your paycheck every night in that same college bar. And when you look at yourself in the broken bathroom mirror you suddenly realize that you have become that old, smelly drunk who still hits on college girls. And you look back at your life and think to yourself - ""If only I'da skipped those fries, everything in my life would be different now."" Trust me, those fries were gourmet compared to In-N-Out Burger's. They tasted like powdery, freezer burned match-sticks that had been reheated under a heat lamp - it was difficult to tell if they were made from potatoes or from some Star Trek food simulator machine. My burger was equally disgusting. It is fair to say the only part of the burger that did not suck was the lettuce. The bun was stale and dry, the browned skin of the bun's top peeled off like 60 year old wallpaper from an old pickle factory, leaving what looked and tasted like a frozen bun that was thawed on high in the microwave.. I have nothing to complain about with the vanilla shake - at last, nothing to complain about. In all told, my last visit to In-N-Out Burger was as disappointing as anything you could imagine. My guess is, there IS a limit to how much you can cut-back on quality just to save a dime. It's a shame for such an iconic brand. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Round 2 - Restaurant Week again! This time around I was quite disappointed. My group ordered pretty much everything on the Restaurant Week menu. I went with the Seared Ahi Tuna, Short Ribs, and Peanut Butter Bar. Overall, everything was well cooked, however over....over salty! The texture was just fine, but in the end too much salt. I usually drink a lot of water when I eat, but tonight they should have left the pitcher. My group in general drank a lot of water! I would talk more about the food, in the end all I can remember was --- dang that was salty! Sorry gang I don't know if I can go another round for this place. Ding, ding, ding -- Enjoy! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I could swear the weights weren't this heavy before...Ok, I haven't been here for a while but I've been a member for years and even though I have only one ""check in"" here, the reason could be for the fact that the last time I was here I was wearing a beeper, but now I'm planing to be more consistent with my exercise routine, I'm hoping my doctors health warning will be stronger than my willpower.

You can find the newest equipment available, treadmills, weight machines, and free style weights, they also have aerobic, spinning or many other classes, public or private. The facility also counts with clean locker rooms and clean towel service, there is also a snack bar where you can recover from a hard workout with a delicious drink. You can count on Alexis the bar attendant to recommend something good for whatever your needs are, he makes some killer protein shakes!

 Last week, for the first time to either location, I went to Borgata for a cut, and Chandler for the worst color job ever (see my review under the Chandler location). My cut was fine, nothing really spectacular, but also not particularly bad. BTW, she was a level 3, which I think is probably not that different from a typical stylist at any other salon. However, the attitude and service at the front desk, made me never want to return. The girls up front talked down to me, and were super pushy on products and tipping (I'm a good tipper). When I booked the appointment, the reservationist told me about a facebook special for 40% off. Because of the special, I decided to come in immediately. But when I was rung up the girl up front didn't include the discount. I asked about the discount (the reason I came in) and the girl seemed annoyed and then asked me for a printout of my facebook page. When I told her this was never mentioned, she told me I would have to get it. I live way out near Apache Junction (a good cut is worth a drive), so it's impossible! Then she actually told me to go to a library to print it! She also suggested that I should download the app to my iphone (which she saw in my hand), and show that to her. (Don't they have the internet, can't they simply look it up?) Finally, she agreed to do the 40%, but then she refused to tell me the price of the hair cut after the discount (I also bought a product that they said worked great (it didn't)). I asked when I was deciding on tip, and she actually told me that I had to give tip on the original price (not the 40% off) but tempered it by conceding that I didn't need to give tip for the product! Are you kidding, of course you don't tip the stylist on a product! Not to mention it was a foot product that I had been somewhat interested in myself (until they told me how great it worked). I go to salons, spas, nail salons, luxury hotels etc, all the time, and know how to tip, and usually give generous ones. But I don't need some RUDE, PUSHY, front desk girl telling me how to give tips! Her pushy ways worked though, because I left more than I attended. Even though I liked the feel of the place, I chose to drive to Chandler for my color (which ultimately turned out to be a huge mistake!). I must add that the one person who was supersweet and professional was the girl who worked behind the mineral makeup counter, and genuinely answered my questions without ever forcing a sale, unlike the the front desk girls. My advice is to save money and time, and go somewhere that they actually care to do an excellent job and don't see you as a dollar sign. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Hyakumi has lovely ambiance and was quite romantic. The service was impeccable. However, the food was less than desirable. The portions were over generous for Magaro- we are talking 3-4 bite pieces that were stringy. The Unagi was fair. California roll, was fine. Miso soup was good. The Edamame was overcooked and mushy. Overall for what you pay for I left feeling completely unsatisfied. Las Vegas cuisine has gone down hill in the last years. If you were here for the Teppanyaki I am sure you would be happy.

 Fuck you Cox. Seriously, fuck you. If I could give you no stars I would I contacted them before I moved to try and get TV and Internet service. This was all done online, easy, and simple. Until the next day when I got an e-mail response that my order was canceled. They did not tell me why, only said to call to find out more information. Why was it canceled? Oh because someone used my middle and last name and my social to open an account THREE YEARS AGO. So let's see: it's a fraudulent account that owes them money, but they didn't even check names or addresses? Their excuse was that, ""technology was different three years ago"". I call bullshit. So here is what they tell me: call our local fraud hotline, and they will give you the steps you need to take. I did this, but the problem is the fraud department doesn't have a hotline, they have an answering machine. Any call you make to them goes directly to voicemail. They have to call YOU. It took them 4 days to call me back, but before that I was fed up and called the main line back who told me I could go to the offices for more information. I drove all the way across town to their office that gave me a fraud packet. When the fraud department called me back, you know what they were going to do? Just send me a damn fraud packet. So I fill out the packet completely. I get a police report, get documents, etc. I send it via certified mail with return requested to the address they had on the packet, and not for cheap. What happens? THE LETTER IS RETURNED TO ME. Apparently even though they told me to send it certified to the address given, they won't accept it. My mother then faxed all 8 pages TWICE to them, but still with no confirmation. I still don't know if my fraud packet ever got to them. They also wouldn't let me request service during the 30 day period they would need in order to rectify my fraud issues, so I moved without TV or Internet. Well even if it does come back and my slate is clean with Cox, they can go suck their own name because I would never, ever do business with a shady monopoly of a company that obviously is so greedy that they do not help those who are willing to pay for service, but just accept accounts with the bare minimum of information and will not help you when they have screwed you over completely. Their customer service is bogus and their fraud department even more so: I would be amazed to find out if there were more than one person actually working there. I will never do business with this company and hope no one else does either. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I've been coming here for the past 10 years and have always enjoyed the food and the atmosphere, so I'm sad to have to write a review that speaks poorly about the place. Having said that, my last experience at Tessaro's was ruined before we were even seated. While waiting with my girlfriend to be seated for 25 minutes, a party of 3 walks in and is immediately seated. When I ask why a party of 3 would be seated before the many parties of 2 waiting I was told that the seating was laid out specifically to accommodate a specific number of people: absurd! We proceed to wait another 15 minutes until a 2 top opened up. I would gladly recommend this place on the food, but given how inefficient the seating system is I'd only go when you can be seated right away. ",0,1,0,0,0

 As cheap as $29.99 or an entire day of eating is, do NOT go to this buffet. I do not think anything there was good, except for the watermelon. Grilled tilapia is somehow breaded. Dessert looks like it was pulled out of a box and placed on a stand. Sushi was still frozen. Put it this way, I did not get any item from the buffet line more than once. They messed up steamed rice. wtf? In case you are wondering how, there were so many hard uncooked rice morsels on my plate. Save your money and eat elsewhere. If you're wondering why I would even eat at a buffet like this after experiencing places like the bellagio or wynn buffet, it is because I was forced to purchase the all-inclusive package for the group I was with. Which is worth it if you actually want to participate in all the stuff they offer, but who really does that while they are in vegas? ",1,0,0,0,0

 This is the best nightclub I have ever been too, especially in Vegas. The entire vibe of the place is great and everyone was there to have a good time and party in true Las Vegas fashion. We went during ""Party Rock Mondays"" in July and was worried because of all the hype surrounding the place, and it def. lived up to the hype. Never at a nightclub have I received such amazing customer service from everyone working there between the bartenders, waitress', bussers, hosts, etc. Did not experience any pretentios attitude. We went in through general admission because we were staying at the cosmo and got in for free. After walking around the place, which is huge and sort of like a maze (which I saw as a positive and a cool way to go around and see what the club has to offer). We were out in the dayclub area and noticed a few empty tables so our group decided to talk to a host and ended up getting set up with a table for the night and had an amazing time. We had a table outside for NIght Swim at XS the night before and the whole vibe, set up, seating was SO much better at Marquee. It was also sufficiently cheaper which I was surprised by. The DJ's in all rooms had the crowd going. In my opinion, right now Marquee is the club to beat in Las Vegas. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I'm not going to lie: we were here with a large group (19 people) and in a rush to head over to the Marquee (or was it Tao?). Between us all, we probably ordered 4-5 pizzas and I only got to try one: the typical BBQ chicken. Was it good? Yes. Amazing for a Wolfgang Puck restaurant? Maybe, maybe not. It didn't blow me away like I thought it would, but maybe we should have gotten something else. Of course, the ambiance is great in the Venetian. We were sat outside next to the bar and got pretty decent service -- except my friend who sat in a corner behind a pillar got skipped over his water a couple times, but it's forgivable. Moral of the story: don't get a pizza at higher end places. If you like, it seems like they have smaller, quieter seating behind glass doors. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I had dinner here at the end of a long week of conference meetings. Compared to the fast food, food court, and hotel fare I'd eaten throughout the week before, this was a fabulous meal. Compared to any Tex-Mex restaurant in Texas, however, this was pretty bleh. So, for travelers that know good Mexican or Tex-Mex food, you may be disappointed with the flavors here--but given your few eating options in Phoenix, I'd definitely recommend it. Primary food gripes: the salsa was smoky tasting and so dark as to almost look black. The carnitas in my chimichanga were dry and burnt. Little spice or flavor to the overall dish. Positives: Their top shelf margarita was excellent. Just excellent. Also, one of my fellow diners loved the stuffed chicken dish. Service-related: Attentive, friendly service, if a little overly so. Weak or no A/C on in the restaurant while we ate. In June. Not awesome. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This show is pretty cool. The bf and I stood in line at tix4tonite and paid $70 bucks per ticket which was a very good deal compared to the online prices from $106 to $167. Standing in line wasn't bad, but once you purchase them at the tix4tonite stand you have to go over to MGM and stand in line to get your seats and actual show tickets. Luckily when we went there was no line so the process didn't take long at all. I would suggest not sitting in the front b/c the show is a moving stage and elevated so sitting in the middle anywhere gets you a good view no matter what. My favorite part was the finale at the end which is very awesome. This show is gravity defying! I recommend Ka and Zumanity as the cirque du soleil shows to see. I've heard others that have seen O and La Reve say it is not worth the ticket prices. I think Ka and Zumanity are shows even the guys that are dragged by their gf's will enjoy. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I really don't like giving lower star ratings, but wow...sometimes it just can't be helped. Pasta Cucina here at the Texas Station was in a word, underwhelming. After being seated I just wasn't even close to impressed. I should have known something was up because on a Friday night the place was near empty, with maybe only 4-5 tables being occupied at the time. Spider-Sense failed me! The place was set nicely with great ambience and warmth. But none of this was used to the restaurant's advantage. After being seated by the friendly manager we proceeded to wait...and wait. My lady and I did hear some light arguing in the back of the house involving why the couple that just came in (us) was seated at our particular table. Seems our waiter was hoping it would stay empty until closing so he could promptly leave right when the restaurant closed. I being a good sport disregarded hearing this to try and give him a chance. I know the feeling of wanting to go home after a long day at work. We waited for nearly 20 minutes before our waiter came out to greet us, with me pretending we didn't hear him talking about us prior. He gave us a wine list (which was average at best) but we passed on it and asked for an ice water and iced tea. Again, we waited. About 15 minutes later we received our drinks and the menus. Strike one! The real reason we decided to try here was because Station Casinos was touting Pasta Cucina's 2 for $20 menu, with 11 entrees to choose from. I would have never gone to this place otherwise to give it a shot. So call me surprised when we receive our menus there is no 2 for $20 option to be found. I inquire about this and I get a look from the waiter as if I'm a cheapskate. I am, but there's no need to be rude to me! Our waiter takes the regular menus from us and replaces them with a smaller one that has the 2 for $20 entree specials on it. Funny thing is that because the entrees were on the cheaper side we wanted to order something from the appetizer section of the regular menu to treat ourselves. Our waiter didn't even bother asking if we still wanted to see the regular menu. The smart thing to do would have been to bring out BOTH the regular and 2 for $20 menu and let us choose. This guy thought we were foolish and wouldn't even know they were running specials. Hello! There is a big billboard plastered right outside the casino's property! Strike two! The last straw for me was the food itself...so bland and boring! No inspiration with the cooking. I could have cooked this same exact food myself at home! No joke! Our 2 for $20 menu entrees came with soup or salad and breadsticks as a starter. The breadsticks were a bit of a joke, warm but very reminiscent of those from that 'Olive' place. Same shape too! Forgettable for sure. Pasta Cucina's house salad though was horrendous. The other unnamed 'Italian' place had a much better salad! Veggies were on the limp side and the dressing was watered down with not much pop. Sad. Our entrees didn't fare much better. I had the porcetta pizza with mushrooms and artichoke hearts. The crust was cracker thin which was nice and crispy, but the toppings were scarce and overdone from sitting under the oven or the heat lamp too long. Seriously, the small sprinking of toppings didn't give me much to go on, and the sauce and cheese were lacking in flavor and quantity. A real let down. My lady's chicken parmesan fared a little better but barely. The portion of food was much more acceptable, with two large chicken breasts, and a good serving of spaghetti and marinara. The spaghetti was okay but could have used more sauce and some salt and fresh herbs. The chicken parmesan itself was unimpressive since it really tasted like it came frozen instead of made fresh. The breading was soggy in some parts and actually nearly blackened in a couple spots along the edges from overcooking. I couldn't get past this because really, who likes burnt breading? Covering it with sauce and some cheese doesn't make the burnt taste go away. I flipped the chicken over to check and sure enough, over dark edges. This was strike three for me! We were out of there ASAP. Our waiter didn't bother keeping our drinks refilled, I had to ask him after they were sitting empty to fill them back up. We had quite a bit of leftovers from both entrees and asked for some to go boxes. Our waiter proceeded to take our food to the back and pack them up. At this point I was totally turned off from Pasta Cucina and just wanted to get out of there. I paid and even though I had some lackluster service from our waiter, I left him a 20% tip anyway. I take our leftover box and drive home. An hour later I'm hungry again. I open up the box and guess what?! Our lovely waiter only packed up my leftover bland A$$ pizza! No leftover chicken parmesan! Pasta Cucina is a B-U-M-M-E-R. Avoid! ",1,0,0,0,0

 The positives- the atmosphere was good and the service was great. My water cup was never empty and I drink a lot of water. Overall, the food was okay but not worth the price and not what I would expect from an establishment with Gordon Ramsay's name. The appetizer sliders were delicious. My entre salad was just lettuce and pears so it was lacking another component- pecans, blue cheese, something! It was disappointing. I would not recommend that item. My husband got the shepherds pie, which again tasted fine just not worth the price and it was smaller than I expected. We shared the toffee dessert which again was good but still average for a dessert. We just didn't think it was worth it. We wouldn't go here again. It wasn't bad, except the salad, but we would rather go somewhere else next time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My friend invited me for lunch with friends since I know my New Mexican food and amazingly, I haven't been here yet after a decade in the valley. I judge every New Mexican restaurant by their carne adovada, the signature dish of northern New Mexico besides the green chile cheeseburger and sopapilla. Sitting outsude is a choice to be weighted heavily given the weather. Nice for evenings but not for lunch in the summer unless you're under the misters. You might THINK you'll be OK in the shade... We ate outside on the patio for Sunday lunch. Anyway service was nice but somewhat inefficient. The beertaps were 10 feet away but our server went inside, I guess to add the order as well as have it filled. It took a while to bring back the incorrect beer. Anchor Steam and Lagunitas IPA are the saving graces for beer. Anchor Steam was served at first in a Hoegaarten 330ml glass. This is UNDER 12 ounces for $5.75. UNACCEPTABLE. Don't accept the ""premium beer"" line, get a big boy glass. My next one I asked for a big boy glass. I tried my friend's bloody mary and it tasted totally righteous - this isn't a mellow V-8 tomato soup pillow! Garnishes vary, you might get a mushroom, you might get a celery stick... Our appetizer was served without silverware or napkins. Asked for silverware from manager. My main was carne adovada with eggs. The plate had an excellent eye appeal and was served extremely hot. You'll need to be prepared for this as all hot plates are served ON A HOT METAL PLATE. BEWARE. You're warned by me as well as the server. So how was the carne adovada? Not technically accurate or traditional. The meat was smoked (they have a smoker and a woodpile out back), and this is not usually done in New Mexico - the pork is usually marinated overnight before being slow cooked for several hours and the fat rendered out. Here at Richardson's not all the fat was rendered out and this made for some sort of funk in one bite, and the smoke flavor was to the point of ashtray on another few bites. Mean and in between though was a nice smoky style to the carne adovada but it seemed overpowering. Good CA has a depth of flavor in the red chile sauce with the other ingredients. It also came with beans and the flavor was great and out of the ordinary. The potatoes were plain and so were the scrambled eggs (eggs are made to order, you don't HAVE to get scrambled.) I guess we have to sit inside for decent and accurate service, but I'll give another dish a chance. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We went to Distrito for the first time on a Saturday night. Pleasantly surprised by the colorful decor, open doors overlooking an amazing park and the creative menu. We were celebrating a birthday so we went LARGE and ordered just about everything! The blood orange margarita will have you craving more...seriously fantastic! We ordered all the appetizers and LOVED them all! We pretty much all had cravings for tacos so we ordered a couple of the taco bars to share and it was delicious. Some of the best guacamole I've ever had and the chips are homemade and perfect. Our service was superb! Our waitress Hillary saw to each and every detail and was well seasoned on the menu and how things were prepared...we all think that's very important! There was no disappointment with her suggestions. The manager Ben was attentive and came to our table a few times making sure everything was perfect, exactly like a good manager should. We ended our evening with yummy cappuccino and dessert. My only disappointment was no flan...I would highly recommend this gem in the middle of Old town Scottsdale! They even have free valet parking. Jose Garces should be proud of this establishment. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We gave them a year to fix their service issues and went back this week. We had a large party. Two of the people with us never got their food! I mean they NEVER got it after several complaints to the wait staff. Same thing happened a year ago! Their solutions is to bring watermelon shots none of us wanted. Seemed like an excuse. The manager finally came over, apologized and took money off the bill. However when we left with our two hungry friends I let him know that this happened last time and we stayed away for a year. He said "" Well Ma'am if the same thing keeps happening I would just never come back!"" No joke! The manager said that about his establishment. He got his wish and the privilege of my 1st ever YELP review. None of us will EVER be back! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I have been wanting to go here for yearsssssssssss. Typically when a restaurant has that much hype, you would expect to pay a ton of money to eat there, but I knew the pizza here is not crazy expensive, so I have no idea what held me back for so long. So finally, on my b-day weekend, my girlfriend Abby treated me to Pizzeria Bianco, a place she been wanting to try out for a while as well. As I'm sure many of the reviews probably already note, this place is now open for lunch. We went about 1:30 pm on a Friday and were able to grab a seat right away at the bar. The place stayed busy the whole time, even when we left at 3:00 pm, but you wouldn't have to wait more than a couple minutes for a table. I started out with one of their draft beers, not too impressed so I switched to San Tan on the next one. I loved the coziness of the place, and completely understand why there would be such a long wait in the evenings. I had the Wiseguy pizza and Abby had the Sonny Boy. Over all pretty good. I think we were both expecting to have some light shine down on us from heaven and the bartender bust out some harps as we took our first bite. The pizza was good, and in any other place I would be overly impressed but I think the years of hype stole away some of the pizza's thunder. I actually like La Bocca Urban Pizzeria better. Hope that don't break any of your hearts hearing that. Everyone should go at least one time. I wouldn't mind coming back again as well, I wish I could go before Suns games. I could probably add my name to the list before the game and get seated after! Protip: If you just want to try this place out, go for lunch. If you have time (and money) to burn, it would be a fun experience to drink next door for a couple hours, then eat some tasty fresh pizza. ",0,0,0,1,0

 MMM nice creamy ice cream! I really enjoyed this place and the nostalgic feeling i got with the small wooden spoons. I am on the upward mailing list so i received a free b-day dessert and i got a triple scoop of Vietnamese coffee. Um not quite Vietnamese coffee flavor, but it was a good coffee/espresso flavor in general. I really liked the creaminess of the ice-cream even though i can honestly say i kinda like a little bit more icy texture instead. Regardless the flavors i tried were pretty darn good. The cookies were just okay. My sister and brother in law got an ice-cream sandwich. (between two cookies). I mean it is no urban cookie ice-cream sandwich, but it hits the spot. It'd be better if the cookies had some outstanding deliciousness. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they are better, but they may have been sitting there for a little bit. so you ask me the simple question... ""you gonna be back?""...to that i respond in the words of storage wars....YUUUPPPP!! ",0,0,1,0,0

 If you live or work within the Henderson area, this is not a bad place for Dim Sum, especially if you want to avoid having to drive to Chinatown. Price is comparable, taste is good however it lacks variety. If you like the pineapple bun, order it upon seating so it will be ready by the time you are ready for dessert. It's clean and not greasy. My favorite thing there is one of the servers who speaks English really well and Spanish who thinks she owns the restaurant (or at least she tells me that). She is fun and entertaining at the same time. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I use YELP all the time and find the information beneficial however while visiting my 80 year old aunt in Las Vegas she asked that I take her to a salon to cut her hair. My was a bit long so I decided to find a place in YELP and we could both get our hair cut. I called and made an appointment for the both of us so we could make her other appointments. When we arrived I knew that the place wouldn't be in the best location after I had read the reviews. The two owners there were in the middle of working on other clients. 1pm came and went and 15 minutes later my aunt asked if it would be much longer since she had another appointment. The two guys who I can only assume are Ric and Noel became angry and said they couldn't exactly say how long they would be and we wouldn't expect to get in right away to a doctors office. These two guys started becoming very irate, yelling at my aunt and myself about time and their behavior became unacceptable, snarky to the point of scaring my aunt. They said they could reschedule and I explained that I lived out of town and would be leaving and this was the only time I was available. They then told us to leave. Ric or Noel stated that he couldn't work under pressure and wouldn't be able to cut our hair. This behavior is UNACCEPTABLE, UNPROFESSIONAL and I would never recommend a place that yells at a 80 year old woman EVER. DO NOT GO HERE. These guys should not run a business or be around the public until they learn to control their outbursts. I would say they probably wrote the below recommendations to get people into the salon.

 This was a very easy 5 stars to give! The food here was incredible! I went with a small group of friends and we shared 2 starters and 5 mains between us and each one was absolutely delicious!! The food feels very authentic and the flavours are genuinely magnificent. To begin with we had satay and roti with a spicy dip that all of us agreed we would happily drink as soup it was so scrummy! For the mains we had crispy shredding beef, two duck dishes, a squid and a chicken - each one very different but very tasty! The portions were sizeable (perfect for sharing) and the service was quick and friendly. The restaurant was buzzing too, so the atmosphere was great! In terms of pricing, though this place isn't cheap, it's also not expensive, with mains falling around the \ u00a39 mark in general. As far as Malaysian cuisine goes this felt very authentic and was really very tasty!Absolutely worth a visit if you're ever in Edinburgh! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Wow. Worst dining experience I've had since a little buffet in Louisiana. Terrible old and dingy decor. Our seats and tables were basically hosed down. It was all wet from someone ""cleaning"" it. The buffet was scary and I thought I may get food poisoning, so I stayed away from all mayonnaise concoctions. Prime rib was a dark brown - totally overcooked. The condiments for baked potatoes were set-up before the utensils, not after the baked potatoes - so I had to go in reverse in the buffet. Most of the selections were meat. The salad bar, ugh...The vanilla ice cream was out and there was an array of drip bowls for dripping machine. The shrimp were a strange orangey brown color and cocktail sauce was drizzled all over the bar. There was a mess of serving spoons everywhere. The chicken was good. But I picked a hair out of it. not even a decent dessert could appear here. My silverware was sticky to start. The chocolate cake tasted like a recycled HoHo. The whole experience was simply awful. At $36.00 for two people, it's not even a deal. I am convinced all the other buffets on town ship their week old leftovers here to serve. I feel bad for posting this because some of the servers were very sweet people and I can't imagine having to show up here everyday. OMG. Just an awful experience. * after reading some of these 3 - 4 - 5 star reviews, I'm really worried for some of my fellow Yelpers. This place is dangerous. I'd rather hand over my life savings to a drunk leprechaun dancing naked on a roulette table at O'Shea's than ever set foot NEAR this place again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Man...what potential. We stopped by before Black Sabbath since KDKB was doing a remote and contest for front row seats. There was also a diamondbacks game that night as well....as you may know that's quite busy for downtown. We stayed on the patio since it was nice out. As far as we could tell there was only one server for the entire area. I really felt bad for this girl. She was busting her butt trying to serve people but the frustration showed and I don't blame her. How could management staff a place like that? Maybe they had a number of call outs or no shows that day who knows. But it was bad. We got some happy hour food which took forever and a day to get. The bacon wrapped shrimp seemed pretty good. You get four decent sized shrimp wrapped in bacon and a decent sauce. Only half my shrimp had bacon wrapped on them, but hey who's counting. And I wasn't going to make that poor waitress more miserable. The nachos looked good enough, I didn't try them but how can you screw them up? We should've thought ahead and saved that server time and helped her by ordering say four drinks at a time. The time we spent there, over an hour, we were only able to order one drink each. And that was a stretch. My friends got their beers and ten minutes later I got my greyhound. Again....this has nothing to do with the server! She was really trying. I blame management for not taking advantage of double events that night AND a radio station on site. It shouldn't be that hard. The place seemed like it would be good and maybe on a non-event day I would go to see if that's true. If you go on event days just plan on waiting.....eating with your hands since you apparently get no napkins or dinnerware and flagging down the food runner who is asking every table if the food is their order. We watched it go by a few times and thought wow.....these guys are so disorganized. Legends.....in bad management. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I'll preface this review by saying that I was there on a Saturday night, and the place was pretty packed and loud. I have no idea what this place is like during the day, but if you're like me and don't enjoy strangers bumping into you every 30 seconds, don't go on a Saturday night. This brings me to the important part of my review, which is how I almost had to throw down with some v-neck clad, Jersey Shore hopeful who felt it necessary to almost knock my girlfriend and I down as he walked past. I guess he didn't like the fact that I pushed back to avoid falling into the table my friends were sitting at, because he got into a staring contest with me, trying to size me up. Personally, I don't care who you are; there is no excuse for acting like that, especially to a lady, and then trying to get in my face about it because I didn't allow you to manhandle me. I told him if he tried that again, we could finish the conversation outside. I guess he knew better than to try anything when security guards are near, because he left. That being said, there's a high risk of these incidents happening in places like these, where there is absolutely no room to walk by, people are drunk and ignorant, and egos are running high. It takes away from an otherwise enjoyable experience. The music was good, the beer was cold, and my friends and I had a great time. However, due to that incident I had, I don't see myself going back. It's a shame because it is otherwise a pretty cool place. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It's better than the big chain pizza guys but far from New York pizza. I heard a friend rave about it so got it delivered. The pizza was cool enough that the cheese was almost solidified and I live a mile away. The pepperoni they use is a really good brand. The sauce was OK. A little heavy on the spices and too acidic and the crust didn't even taste like it belonged with the pizza, it just didn't bring anything to the party. We also got the artichoke dip which was spot on, served with tasty, toasted Italian bread. The dip was a creamy, cheesy sauce filled with artichoke that was firm and had a lot of flavor. The only real problem I have with it was that the pizza was not cooked on a stone, it was cooked in a convection-conveyor oven. I could tell because of not only the flavor, but when I flipped a piece over, I could see the screen imprinted on it. If you're going to be as bold to have the words ""New York"" in the title of your brand, at least cook pizza in a stone oven to achieve that lovely dark brown char on the bottom that is a staple of New York pizza which not only makes for a better crust, but overall flavor. I'm willing to give it another shot. Next time I'll eat in and try some pasta. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have resisted writing a review of Nicky's for a long time since I've tended to view this place as my own for the last 5-6 years. I've only ever recommended it to my closest friends in an attempt to keep the crowds down and to preserve this as a special, hidden gem for only MY use. I've taken friends there to introduce them to the pleasures of a truly great dining experience and EVERY ONE of them has been blown away. Alas, when the Pittsburgh Magazine list of top 25 restaurants included Nicky's, I knew it was over. Now I have to share this place with the great unwashed who haven't grown up with it like I have over the last several years. It pains me. Simply stated, this is WAY better that top 25. It might be top 2 or 3 in Pittsburgh. It's THAT good. But you won't like it so don't bother to go. (Will that keep you away and restore my own private relationship with Nicky's to what it used to be???) First off, the appearance from Western avenue is not very inviting. You walk into a somewhat decrepit looking building down a hallway to the hostess station. You can see into the kitchen and all the activity and smells that emanate from there are assurance that you've come to the right place and that this is gonna be GOOD! You don't know the half of it. Seating options are inside or out. Outside is a magical garden filled with plants I didn't know could exist on the Northside. How they keep the appearance of an urban jungle is beyond me - but the atmosphere is instantly relaxing and soothing. A host of Thai-related accents, umbrellas over the tables, brick walls - all take you so far away from the Northside you can't even imagine you aren't in Southeast Asia. With a no corkage fee (except on weekends) policy it's one of the best place for BYOB in the city. So bring some wine or champagne and feast your eyes on the menu. Oh my. If you can read through that without needing to wipe the drool from your mouth you need to have somebody check your pulse I've eaten here probably 35 times or more and have sampled so many things - not one of which I didn't rave about or wouldn't order again. The flavors are unlike anything you'll see anywhere else. Thai food is one of my all time favorite cuisines and Nicky's tops the list! And don't associate Thai food with HOT - it isn't unless you want it to be. I always do - on a scale of 1-10 I always order ""Thai Hot"" which is above 10. But the flavors? The curries, noodles, spring rolls, pork/chicken/fish dishes, the soft-shell crabs - all filled with amazing sauces and flavors that you want to savor every bite. My mouth is watering even now as I think about it. Amazing. Plus, if you're a vegetarian, you have a huge selection of entrees that will knock your socks off. Service is always excellent and attentive. Specials are so tempting and the price is right. I couldn't recommend it more highly. I could eat there several times a week. Wonder if they have a meal plan???? ",0,0,0,0,1

 I helped broker a visit by this company to a friend of mine who is disabled. I called Joey and he said he'd take special care of my friend. When my friend balked at the price, Joey said he ""negotiated"" a special deal because of his disabilities. Then he delivered a much cheaper safe than he had promised and charged twice as much as it was worth at any other safe shop. After my friend realized he did not get the safe he expected, he tried to call Joey and arrange a return. Joey hung up on my friend and then would not answer or return his calls. Shame on Joey for taking advantage of the disabled. Beware the use of cryptic model numbers to bait and switch. This is not a guy I'd like to know that I had valuables. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I definitely recommend this place for lunch not dinner. Dinner can be very pricey, and the selection at dinner isn't exactly awe inspiring. For lunch you reap the same benefits as dinner, such as being able to go to the top of the Stratosphere without having to pay extra. To sum it up the lunch menu offers the dinner entrees worth getting at a fraction of the price. Lunch ranges ~$12-$17 for sandwiches, and the pre fixe menu for ~$30. Definitely worth a try. If you have your heart set on a view of the strip at night, restaurant.com offers a dinner only coupon(p.s. sign up for the email and buy when on sale.) ",0,0,1,0,0

 Spam! They have Spam! Yeah that compressed, salty, meat from a can. Ok, ok...I realized I may be the only one excited about this, ESPECIALLY since they are known for their FABULOUS rotating beer selection, 30+ on tap at any one time. They also offer some wines on tap as well. Order up a flight or 2 (6 tasters of your choosing of any of the listed beers) and expand your beer palate or go for a pint of your favorite. Their menu is quite complementary to their beer offerings. Ok, now back to the Spam. Now trust me on this, when Spam is done right it can be quite tasty. They do it very well here. Their Spam Sliders, as a meal if you enjoy Spam as much as I do, or nicely shared. It is fried to crisp perfection and served on toasted Hawaiian bread with a Sriracha mayo coleslaw. My other Spammy favorite is a Sammy, the Churchill Grilled Cheese, you pay a lil extra for the crispy fried Spam goodness (or bacon, you really can't go wrong here) but it goes so well with the melty deliciousness of smoked mozzarella and fontina cheese. You have to come and check out their Tuesday TV dinner meal. A TV dinner like compartment tray comes to you filled with yummies that vary every week (Main dish, side or 2, and a dessert). These are not Hungry Man meals but you won't leave hungry. Make sure to follow them on Facebook to see what they are serving up that Tuesday and get there early because it has been know to be a sell out option. I love this place, but, ""Why only 4 stars?"", you ask. Well, it gets quite loud in the main restaurant area. Every sound kind of carries and you spend your time speaking loudly to have a conversation. So when the weather is good I like the patio mostly because the noise issue does not carry-over to the patio. Always, check their Facebook for fun and educational events and ""classes"". I recently attended a ""Cider School"" here on a weekend before they opened for business that day. In attendance were Woodchuck and J.K. Scrumpy brewers/reps. We tasted 6 types of apples commonly used in cider making. Tasted several ciders, including some that were not even on the market yet. Oh don't let me forget the food pairing.
