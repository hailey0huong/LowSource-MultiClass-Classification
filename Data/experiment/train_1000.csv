 Kids eat free on Wed night. Place has a strange layout so if someone has their chair out too far the server can't get through. Tableside guacamole is good but pricey for what you get. Both the carne asada and chipotle chicken were super salty. They were very free with the chips and salsa, though. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I probably have to say, this is like a dream world for me. This is probably one of my favorite Electronic stores to be in. Fry's Electronics, basically has it all, wall to wall electronics, name it, they probably have it. Knowing that I had to go to this store for an External Hard Drive at a decent price, is all I need for this trip. Just stepping inside Fry's Electronic, I feel like a kid in a candy store. My head is bobbling all over the place, and just pointing at things, that I have no clue what they are, and smile at it. Of course in the back in my mind, I'm saying ""I want this, I want that, hmmm where can I use this."" But my main focus was External Hard Drive and get out. I was able to find the Hard Drive section but had issues finding External Hard Drive, since its wall to wall Hard Drives, that just makes it kind of hard to find which one I really need. But I was relieved when I was approached by a sales rep who showed me where the External Hard Drive was and showed me one that was on Sale. Of course I was sold, and satisfied with the product. I was so ready to get to the check out, till my wife wanted to find some hair straightener on the other side of Fry's. Of course I didn't mind at all, going to find a straightener, but we never really got a straightener that she wanted. But we ended up doing more window shopping. Found a lot of massagers, excellent cookware, deep fryer machines, hot dog machines, I was even drooling over the cotton candy machine. The more I stayed in the store, the more I want to look around, so I did. I'm also into the whole computer animation, where I notice that they had programs that I really wanted to get. I know some software's may not be sold in store, but the fact that they had a lot of Adobe software and other software's that might be helpful, just made me drool even more. But what really got me, was the fact that I saw this computer tower which wasn't like any other computer tower and wondering if they had that tower itself on sale. So I decided to browse around the computer section, even though I was there at the beginning to start with. Just decided to take a loop back into the computer section and see what they had. Cause someday I wanted to build my own tower, with the components that I really want to get. But I notice my wife was getting tired of walking around and sitting in the chairs they had out on display. Which was basically a sign for us to get out of here, otherwise I'll probably drool over everything and don't know when we'll leave. I guess that whole aspect of "" get External Hard Drive and get out"" didn't really go as planned. Now, all that for an External Hard Drive. That should tell you, that Fry's is an amazing place, especially if your into the whole electronic world. For me, this has to be the best place to buy my components for a new computer when that time comes. It has everything I need, and maybe have something for the wife too. Over all, the best wall to wall Electronic store out there. Very well recommended. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Had a nice little meal here the first night of a conference I attended. I've been to the one in Chicago, and liked it, and there aren't any real complaints here, either. Started with the baked goat cheese and tomato sauce. It was tasty, but I'm a sucker for any type of goat cheese-based dish. My main course was the scallop dish, and while there were 5 scallops on my plate, they were paired with a few measly mushrooms and it just didn't go well together. The view was great, though - we sat instead by right by the windows facing the Bellagio. It was like dinner and a show. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Pretty cool spot, but as previously mentioned, it can get super packed. Forget about getting a table for high profile games ... and getting a table on a Saturday or Sunday during football season ain't gonna happen! Luckily we flew in to Vegas around 4:00 on a Thursday, so we were basically grabbing dinner since we were still on east coast time. The only action going on was a divisional playoff baseball game, so it wasn't too crowded. They have stadium seating (hence the name of the restaurant), so almost impossible for anyone to be in your way while watching the multiple big screens on the wall. That didn't affect us anyway, as we sat on leather couches/benches in a lounge area that had its own personal television. The only downside was that they supposedly accommodate 6 to 8 people, but give you a small slender table meant to hold food for about 3 people. This was not acceptable considering we had drinks, a couple appetizers, silverware, and eventually the entrees. One other thing to mention about this place ... alongside the big screens were current betting odds, which was kinda cool. Service was ""mehhh"" ... they weren't very attentive to refills, requesting extra napkins, extra ketchup, etc. As for the meal, not a great selection of beers, but they did have a few ""beer bucket"" specials. The reason for three (3) stars instead of two (2) is striclty based on the pretzel and beer cheese ... yum. My entree (pastrami sandwich) and side of onion rings were rather average ... good, but average. My Quick and Dirty review: Atmosphere - Pretty cool (other than the tiny tables used in the lounge area seating) Service - Poor Food - Average (except pretzel & beer cheese, which was exquisite) Summary - Good spot if you want to keep track of 4+ sporting events, but I enjoyed the Public House more. They are a short walk down towards the Venetian ... better menu, better drink selection, and more comfy seating. Fewer TVs, but if you grab a seat at the bar (or lounge area), it's easy to settle in.

 This is hands down the most thrilling ride on the Stratosphere, beating out the kinda boring SkyJump by far as well as the stupidly glorified ""merry-go-round"" called Insanity and the barely okay X-Scream. I love how it's not just a drop tower, but it reverses the speedy vertical movement.... you shoot up fast (just 45 miles per an hour but going up that speed is a very different sensation than going down that speed which would be kind of boring) so that you feel some weightlessness and then you drop down fast and continue this movement 3 times or so but at shorter lengths. The fact that the ride is on top of the Stratosphere did not make a difference in the thrill to me because you have a whole lot of ground on top of the building to see that detracts from the fact that you're up so high. Plus, I don't think it would matter much otherwise. This ride would be just as good on ground level. Overall, it's a good ride that just barely makes it 4 stars. It's more like a 3.5 stars, but I rounded it. It could always be much bigger, faster, and not shorten the additional bouncing so much. But then, it would probably scare off too many other people, and they wouldn't have nearly as much business. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This was the first Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale that I tried. It was close to home, we had been shopping all day, and decided to try it for a late lunch. I was disappointed - not because the food was bad, but because it wasn't much different than most of the Mexican restaurants in Spokane. I was hoping for something more adventurous, more authentic, and not the Americanized Mexican food that is prevalent in Washington. That said, the food was as advertised, and was good for what it was. The lunch special price was pretty much standard for the area, and the servings were large. I did look at the individual items on the menu, and noticed the prices seemed high. But since this was the first restaurant that we went to in Scottsdale, I just figured it was the area. The service was good, and the waitress was very friendly. To show how unimpressed I was, this is only about a half a mile from my place, and I have yet to find a reason to go back. Again, the food wasn't bad, but I would rather drive to restaurants with more authentic and adventuresome recipes. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've stayed here 4 times in a span of about 7 years. Same old dive each time, and I've returned each time mainly because of unbeatable cost, considering its prime location in the middle of the new strip. You know: save bundles on room, splurge on meals. With the last visit, however, I think I may have exhausted my patience and tolerance for the fact that they have always booked me in a smoking room every time I reserved a non-smoking room. And -- each time -- upon checking in, they insist that I reserved a smoking room. Customer service skills are non-existent here. They don't always service/clean the rooms daily. The rooms are about par with a C-grade Motel 6 and always leave at least one lasting memory. On my last visit, it was the greasy soiled fabric on the headboards. Lovely. Then they charge you $2 for the phone even if you never picked it up? WTF?? Is that now a universal thing with all the strip casino hotels? How Vegas indeed. That's it, I've had it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is the budget breaker type of restaurant. First class service, food quality far above any other sushi restaurant and the obnoxious pricing to go with it. To leave there with a little buzz on and our stomachs not satisfied nor full, we spent just under $180 for two people. The chefs are very traditional and slightly pretentious with little to no conversation to the patrons. The wait staff is very attentive and helpful. Perfect service and accommodation. I would have given this place 5 stars all day long if the prices were more in line with what they are giving you. $14 for 3 pieces of sashimi seems unreasonable to me. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Terrible. I hate when the workers don't give a crap about their job and it reflects in their work - even the sandwich ""artists"". Came here bc it's been awhile since I've been at Subway and now I remember why. They just make the most haphazrd sub in the world. Meat/cheese is nicely placed, but then the banana peppers olives, other veggies are just jammed in disproportionately. They could take like 1 second and spread out the veggies before mashing it when it's rolled up. Little bit of Light May and Mustard translates into a lot of both. They hate their job, I hate them. - This isn't even for the location here, it's the one in the 5/3rd Building up the street. ",1,0,0,0,0

 *Happy hour review- came here after reading about happy hours in Vegas and I'm sure glad we did! The ""5 for $6 till 7pm"" is available in the bar/lounge area and has outdoor seating available also. We ordered the fad tired beer ( Sam Adams rebel IPA) 2 for $6, along with the pan seared crispy pork belly, roasted mushroom ravioli, sweet chile calamari and walnut turtle pie for dessert (not on HH menu) the dessert. While waiting on our appetizers fresh baked bread was served with a Brie Chardonnay butter and a sun-dried tomato butter. I think I could've ate the bread/better and beer all night. I also like foods the start with the letter B. My ranking of appetizers follows: 1. Mushroom ravioli- portobello and shiitake mushroom in porcini mushroom sauce ( I love me some mushrooms) 2. Crispy pork belly- served with grits and sweet onion chutney ( when you mix the pork belly with the grits and the chutney all together everything just feels like it will be ok, I try to cut down on my pork intake but with grits and chutney, I didn't feel as guilty) 3. Sweet chili calamari- ehh it's calamari- I think I'll omit this one next time *The walnut turtle pie was awesome and I made sure no turtles were harmed in making this pie. *oh and another thing-a plus for the servers to warn us that HH is ending and asking for last minute orders to input before 7, truly a happy hour. =) ",0,0,0,0,1

 Definitely worth it. Went on Sea food night. And from how the cashier put it 85% of the buffet is Seafood lol. Its delicious. The server is on point and keeps your table cleared and drinks replenished. The stations are well stocked and when it gets low they quickly top it off. Whether it be the salad station or anything else. The peel and eat shrimp was good. I didnt have crab legs but they were split in half and looked kind of small. Roast beef was delicious and have no complaints. Between this or Golden Nugget from what i read about their buffet i would save a few bucks and come here. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This was our first time to this very highly recommended establishment,and I must say this was the WORST DINNER I've had in a long time. Coffee was tepid at best Alfredo sauce tasted as if it were from a jar, wait I've had better from a jar. The cannon filling was very gritty and the chocolate sauce was Hershey from a squeeze bottle and definitely was not with the 55.00 bill. We've had better st olive garden.

 For having such great reviews, I was very unimpressed by this place. I'm not sure what they are going for here, possibly a fancy higher-end drink and eatery thing. I was expecting a great beer selection, and on that front, they very much do have great craft beer. However, I've never seen anyone charge as much for beer as this place does. They jack the prices WAY up, so much so that even happy hour pricing doesn't really make it worth going. I ordered the happy hour tacos and they were good, but not amazing or anything. So if you have a lot of money to throw around for expensive beers and even more expensive food; well then you can do so with a nice view from the balcony. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Eigentlich einer der besten Metzger in Karlsruhe. Hier stimmt bei den Produkten wirklich alles. Top Wurstprodukte, Grillgut, Imbiss - alles sehr lecker. Der Laden selbst ist noch ein echter Stadtteilmetzger und ich bin hier die letzten Jahre sehr gerne hingegangen. Allerdings werte ich diesen Laden nach meinem letzten Besuch ab und werde diesen bis auf Weiteres meiden. Die beiden Damen im Service haben die Produkte mit den blanken H \ u00e4nden angefasst ohne sich zwischen den Bezahlvorg \ u00e4ngen die H \ u00e4nde zu waschen oder Handschuhe zu verwenden. Der Dreck von den Geldscheinen und dem Kleingeld wanderte so direkt auf die Fleischprodukte und ich finde das eigentlich nur eklig. Ich w \ u00fcrde mir w \ u00fcnschen, dass die Waren nur mit Handschuhen angefasst w \ u00fcrden. Ich empfehle den Damen mal mit den H \ u00e4nden kr \ u00e4ftig im Kleingeld zu w \ u00fchlen und dann die H \ u00e4nde abzulecken - das ist genau das, was hier den Kunden zugemutet wird.

 Just a chance to put in my $.02 on the Bluebird, since it has been Yelped about so many times. Fantastic lunch spot Downtown. I hear it is a great breakfast, too. Looked at the menu on the chalkboard above the counter and notice that the specials and soups were only on the little sign out front. So I asked and found that one of my fave's hot butternut squash soup was available. It was so cold and the hot soup was delicious. The Cuban sandwich went perfectly with the soup. The cookies and salads looked great, next time. What a great alternative Downtown. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This was my first time eating at a P.F. Chang's restaurant and I was not impressed by their food. The flavors just weren't there! I eat at Chinese restaurants regularly in the Bay Area and I'm not a fan of non-authentic Chinese food but I thought we'd try ordering take-out and bringing it up to our room at PH. I do have to say their take-out counter is very convenient and is located next to the entrance. We ordered the shaking beef which was too salty. I'm a fan of salt but this dish had way too much. The Dan Dan Noodles were ok. It was a little mushy and lacking flavor. I've had Dan Dan noodles at a lot of other places but this one tasted different. Cheesecake was good but tell them to put the raspberry sauce on the side, it tastes gross. Overall, if you 're looking for some take-out, staying at PH, hungry for Chinese, and have enough points on your Total Rewards players card so you don't have to pay for your meal then order here and try different dishes. P.F Chang's is just too overpriced and their food is just ok. Total price for shaking beef, Dan Dan noodles and cheesecake was $37. We could have eaten at Gordon Ramsey's BurGr again for the same price and had a good meal but were too lazy to sit down and eat at a restaurant in addition to BurGr being super busy. I suggest going to the Rio and eating at KJ Seafood and Dim Sum if you feel like Chinese. They have much better food! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I took my company/party of 7 here for our holiday dinner. I had a previous experience at this restaurant where our waitor added an item to our bill which we did not know we ordered. They will confuse you about what you are actually ordering since it is ala carte. When it happened for the second time it was apparent as their common practice. Long story short, my secretary, a very young woman, asked the waitor to suggest a steak for her entre. The waitor suggested a steak to my secretary by name only and my secretary agreed. When we got the bill I found out it was a $180 special steak that was off the menu and no price had been quoted. Upon calling the manager she argued with me and was very defensive. Who wants to get ripped off at dinner? Hey Management! When someone calls in with a concern, you should not argue with them without first at least looking into the situation. We basically got scammed as if we were tourists in a foreign country. The manager who called me back was so defensive, never apologized and offered to buy me only drinks next time??

 Oh god, where to begin..... The room was dirty. VERY dirty. The ""velvet"" headboard had a layer of (I hope) dust, and the bedskirt was stained and disgusting. I sprayed for bed bugs and slept on top of the sheets on the JIC. The bathroom was as bad as rest of the room. The floor hadn't been mopped in weeks (at least) as evidenced by the mildewed grout lines, so to be safe I was sure to shuffle around on a towel rather than allow my feet to touch the floor. There were splatters on the wall, cobwebs - complete with dead gnats - in the corners, and the window shade was broken and water stained. This was probably a nice hotel 10 years ago, but now it's just the red-headed stepchild of the better hotels. If you're a business traveler like me, you do NOT want to stay at this hotel, nor do you want to bring clients here. It's really for the under 25 crowd that's out to drink, have fun on the Strip and not stay in their rooms for any extended period of time. I felt downright scuzzy the whole time I was there, and couldn't wait to get home and take a long, hot ""Silkwood"" shower (if you've seen the movie, you get it). Next door to me was an obnoxious group of people who snuck a dog into their room. Between the loud arguments and the dog barking, it was tough to get any decent sleep. Down the hall was another stellar group, who took the fighting to a whole new level, spilling out into the hallway at 2am telling each other to f* off. Round the clock fun for all.

 Nice people; able to get my car in for an appointment fairly quickly; able to perform a full service that many would not do; decent rates; and seemed like there was no problem with integrity. However, wrong diagnosis for auto repair. Basically, as I was purchasing a car in the Mesa area, I brought the used vehicle here for a pre-purchase inspection. And the diagnosis I received for several issues with some noise was - well This looked ok, so maybe you could try this first, and then try this. We're not sure. I took the car somewhere else later to get everything that needed done done, and was told, umm, no, This is the problem. They fixed said problem, and it solved all of it. I would assume that they drove my car here at Triple A to get a feel for the issue, so maybe even then they just couldn't figure it out. (Again, nice people, but I need to know what actually needs to be serviced, not just start throwing darts.) Maybe they did not in fact drive it to see.

 Lolo's was a place I had heard lots of good things about so I was eager to give it a try myself. The menu is simple, different combos of breakfast favorites and fried chicken. I opted for the #8 Betty Boop (fried chicken breast and waffle) with a side order of bacon and a cup of coffee. The food came out pretty quickly, and was a nice sized portion. I don't have fried chicken often, but Lolo's chicken was cooked well (crispy on the outside) with a lot of flavor. It offset my nice, light waffle perfectly and my bacon was cooked more on the well done side of things (my fav). It filled me up pretty quick, so I took home leftovers. Next time I want to try their grits, but I can't imagine ordering more chicken or waffles then what the #8 offers. I was full all day! We were there on a Monday morning, and while the restaurant was never packed to capacity it was steady. We received good service and my coffee was always full. We were greeted by a smiling server when we arrived, and wished a good day by a server who was not even on duty yet. I'm a sucker for little things like that, I will definitely be back and recommending Lolo's. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was so pleasantly surprised!! I had such a nice experience at the bar in this ridiculously packed restaurant! I stopped into outback for dinner because of the Outback Bowl deal - free bloomin' onion with any purchase! Yes. Yes, please. Because it was just me, I didn't call ahead or anything - but hoped for a spot in the bar/seat yourself section. This place was packed full of people. And they were like sharks over those booths, so I sat myself at the corner of the bar. Mandy, the bartender, was very nice - and she didn't give me that ""oh, it's just you? Eating alone? Forever alone?"" look. Thank you, Mandy. I ordered the outback bowl onion and a Caesar salad with shrimp. I heard Mandy tell one of the other servers that the bloomin' onions were being picked up left and right in the kitchen, regardless of ticket. It seemed like Outback was having some trouble with the demand. Mandy actually flagged down a server with an onion and told her to give it to me. I really appreciated that! Sometimes I get skipped or forgotten about when I'm eating out on my own. Not this time! Basically, everything was delicious. Onion was crispy and hot, shrimp Caesar salad was perfect. I took a to-go box for my onion, and forgot it when I left (like I usually do). Mandy chased me out the door, onion in hand and asked if I still wanted it! I know that she was crazy busy in there, taking time like that is impressive! I'll definitely be back, probably sitting in the shark infested bar section. ",0,0,0,0,1

 NEVER AGAIN. So I was here the other day and I ordered a sandwich that had two different kinds of meat on it (#5 Vito). Instead of salami, I wanted turkey. Pretty simple right? Take one meat away and add a different one. When she told me the total it seemed about $2 too high. When I looked at the reciept I noticed they charged me $2 for the turkey? Wait...I took one meat away and subbed turkey...there's a charge for that?!?! Apparently so. I'm not sure I understand the philosphoy behind this, but I don't agree with it and I'll never eat there again. Only makes sense that if you take one meat away you should be able to sub another for no additional charge. I was told that their sandwiches are made a certain way to assure speed and accuracy. Does reaching down into the turkey bin instead of the salami bin really affect speed that much? Come on! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I think this place needs to figure out whether it wants to be a nightclub, sports bar, Chuck-E-Cheese, or Italian restaurant. The ambiance has been taken down a notch since it was Hammerheads. Pool tables and arcade machines, and pool toys hanging from ceiling in the dining area - yikes. There was one kid playing a shoot-em-up game and another playing with the pool balls. Soft Italian music over the audio would have been much better than listening to the kids play, and the racket of the drunks coming in from the adjacent bar. We showed up around 5:30 on a Friday night and there was only one other table being served in the dining area despite the parking lot being full (everyone was in the lounge). There was only one waitress working the dining area, and she was also working in the lounge. She was trying hard, but it was only her second day on the job. Both her and the bus-boy were dressed as though they were working in a dive sports bar, not a nice restaurant. Kind of a turn-off. She told us all the food and drink items on the menu were $2 off for happy hour, but that was not the case when we received our bill. Turned out only bar food was $2 off. (we still got happy hour priced drinks, though) As an appetizer we ordered Calamari, and I gotta tell you, it was fantastic! Large chunks of tender squid in a very light, flaky batter, served with a nice boat of thick marinara sauce. Best calamari we ever had, for sure. Just wish it was a more ample portion. My husband (it was our anniversary, BTW) ordered veal scallopine sauteed in a lemon sauce with artichoke hearts, mushrooms and capers. He loved it, although according to him, you really have to love lemon. I tried both a bit of the veal, which I thought tasted a bit ""gamey"" (guess I'm not a veal person) and the sauce, which I didn't care for at all. I will definitely not ever order that dish. I ordered the Linguine Portofino, which was huge butterflied shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops (or should I say scallop, since I only found one in the whole dish) and squid in a rich tomato sauce served over linguini. I think the noodles (a generous helping) were home-made and they were delicious, as was the sauce. Both our dishes were served piping hot. Closer to 7:00 pm the dining room filled up more, and my husband and I definitely felt over-dressed compared to the other patrons and wait staff, who were all dressed as if they were in a sports bar. Although our food was very good, the people at one table kept returning their food items (maybe it was because they couldn't stand to eat it after one of the millions of black flies that were milling about the dining room landed on their food). Portofino definitely needs to do something about the flies, which made the atmosphere even less enjoyable. I'll give the authentic food a 4, the service a 3, value a 3.5 and the ambiance a 2. I'll go back, but probably to check out the bar entertainment and not for a nice special occasion dinner. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This place is great! This was our second visit to Yama. We're from L.A., and it has been years since I've found an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant that is this good overall. So, on this trip to Vegas, I was looking forward to returning to Yama, and it was everything I had been looking for. Note that I don't usually eat ""fusion"" sushi, nor all-you-can-eat or pre-prepared sushi. My preference is for ""purist"" sushi, with no California Rolls or Spicy Tuna, no tempura in the rolls, and certainly no mayonnaise sauces. I suppose I'm a bit of a sushi snob. (Sushi in Tokyo spoiled me). However, this place is a great mixture of quality, value, and unique rolls, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Yama is primarily fusion -- lots of americanized rolls, many including tempura or other cooked items, but plenty with fresh fish as well. The rolls were great, but the sushi-style pieces were quite nice as well. I sampled Saba (mackerel), eel, white tuna, albacore, and hamachi, and all were very fresh and excellent cuts. My wife and I also sampled many rolls, and all were fantastic. The ""palm job"" ended up being my favorite ""fusion-style"" roll (hand-roll of soft-shell crab with eel sauce and a few other goodies wrapped in soy paper). To be clear, you're not going to come here looking for mind-blowing omakase, or purist single-piece japanese-style sushi like Echigo or Sasabune in West L.A. That's not what this place is trying to accomplish, and you hopefully already know you're not going to find that style of sushi at AYCE. However, Yama isn't what I would consider ""AYCE quality"" sushi -- it is much better. Last year we ate at a table, and service was decent (very friendly, but they're very busy so the waitresses got to you as quickly as they could, but sometimes it took a little while). This time we sat at the sushi bar, and had a fantastic time. Sushi chef Pauw (I'm pretty sure that was the spelling) was lightening fast, whipped up fantastic cuts of fish and beautifully presented rolls, and had a great ""attitude"" at his game -- a mixture of seriousness, pseudo-impatience, and ""so what'll you have next?"" pressure. But a few funny remarks back and forth, and he would crack an ear-to-ear grin. Every few minutes he would raise his hands like an orchestral conductor, beckoning the diners to call our their orders. I'll absolutely try and get seated at his portion of the bar on my next trip! Five stars comes from freshness, flavor, excellent value, and speed of service at the sushi bar. Even if you're a self-described sushi-snob like me, give it a try. It has an off-strip ""neighborhood"" atmosphere, and it just may surprise you. ",0,0,0,0,1

 For the love of God would they please close this disaster of a restaurant and open up something like a Chick fil -A or even a McDonalds. A Waffle House would be an upgrade! Yeah, it's that bad. Most airport food options suck, but this place is at the top of my airport suck list! Service that is as slow as a tree sloth. Really, don't bother unless you have at least an hour to kill before boarding time. The other week when I was waiting for my flight and had 45 minutes it still was not enough time to eat here, and I had taken a seat at the bar thinking it would be quicker. Um, nope! Even at the bar the service was slow, and I had to end up getting the bbq chicken salad I ordered to go so I could catch my flight. Good thing I looked in the bag because they gave me the wrong meal on top of that. I had to wave someone down to quickly give me the right meal and I ran to my gate barely making the plane. Ate on the plane and the salad was barely passable. As far as a California Pizza Kitchen goes there is not that much healthy here to eat, and a salad is the closet thing on the menu. Seems pricey too. Along with the super slow service this is one to avoid! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I was unaware of the existence of Ross until I moved to Vegas. It was while shopping at Target that I noticed the store just down the way. I figured I would pop by and see what they had to offer. Boy, was I in for a surprise! I now visit Ross on a weekly basis, searching for good buys. The store is iffy on cleanliness. I think it depends on the time of day you go. I've seen it in shambles with merchandise everywhere and I've seen it relatively clean and organized. The employees aren't enthusiastic by any means, but they will help if asked. The main reason I shop here, though, is for the deals. They have tons of linens, clothes, shoes, and home decor for great prices. I dare say 90% of my home decor is from Ross. It's hit or miss as far as finding what you're looking for. If you're just in to browse though, you'll more than likely walk out with something. ",0,0,0,1,0

 One of the best pubs in Edinburgh. PRICE: Reasonable for what it sells, expensive in comparison to other pubs. SIZE: Plenty of alcoves and rooms, giving the place a big feel, but it is in fact not that big. FEEL: The pub is decorated in a tasteful, traditional manner, and is lit warmly. RANGE: The pub stocks a regularly replenished supply of real ale, and they also have a wide selection of top class whiskies and spirits. They often have some surprising delights on tap, such as Aspall cider. TOILETS: Drop down some stairs and find the excellent toilets, well fitted and clean. I first started coming here a couple of years ago with the Grampian Speleological Group (a caving club), where they have their regular meets. We as a large group are well catered-for, and a large space is set aside for us. The staff are friendly, helpful, and always have a drink-related bit of advice to give if you are stumped for ideas as to which of the many real ales and ciders to buy. Prices are not cheap, but equally are not unreasonable for the quality of ales they offer. I love the design of the place too. It has a higgledy-piggledy arrangement of alcoves and rooms that give the place a really interesting feel. Not their choice in particular, simply what happens when you set a pub under an old New Town building. The pub is quite a way away from the city centre or indeed the student south, which has its advantages and disadvantages. It means that it is empty of Forest Caf \ u00e9 crumpets and rowdy rowers, but it also means that it requires a long trek to get to. Well worth it though. I would give this fine establishment two thumbs-up and a shiny gold sticker. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Last week, for the first time to either location, I went to Borgata for a cut, and Chandler for the worst color job ever (see my review under the Chandler location). My cut was fine, nothing really spectacular, but also not particularly bad. BTW, she was a level 3, which I think is probably not that different from a typical stylist at any other salon. However, the attitude and service at the front desk, made me never want to return. The girls up front talked down to me, and were super pushy on products and tipping (I'm a good tipper). When I booked the appointment, the reservationist told me about a facebook special for 40% off. Because of the special, I decided to come in immediately. But when I was rung up the girl up front didn't include the discount. I asked about the discount (the reason I came in) and the girl seemed annoyed and then asked me for a printout of my facebook page. When I told her this was never mentioned, she told me I would have to get it. I live way out near Apache Junction (a good cut is worth a drive), so it's impossible! Then she actually told me to go to a library to print it! She also suggested that I should download the app to my iphone (which she saw in my hand), and show that to her. (Don't they have the internet, can't they simply look it up?) Finally, she agreed to do the 40%, but then she refused to tell me the price of the hair cut after the discount (I also bought a product that they said worked great (it didn't)). I asked when I was deciding on tip, and she actually told me that I had to give tip on the original price (not the 40% off) but tempered it by conceding that I didn't need to give tip for the product! Are you kidding, of course you don't tip the stylist on a product! Not to mention it was a foot product that I had been somewhat interested in myself (until they told me how great it worked). I go to salons, spas, nail salons, luxury hotels etc, all the time, and know how to tip, and usually give generous ones. But I don't need some RUDE, PUSHY, front desk girl telling me how to give tips! Her pushy ways worked though, because I left more than I attended. Even though I liked the feel of the place, I chose to drive to Chandler for my color (which ultimately turned out to be a huge mistake!). I must add that the one person who was supersweet and professional was the girl who worked behind the mineral makeup counter, and genuinely answered my questions without ever forcing a sale, unlike the the front desk girls. My advice is to save money and time, and go somewhere that they actually care to do an excellent job and don't see you as a dollar sign. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Remember that time back in college when you were so stoned at like 3 in the morning with a serious case of the munchies? And the only thing you could find in the frat house refrigerator was a bag of frozen french fries that had been in there since your freshman year. But being desperate, you threw them in the oven at 500 degrees ('cause you just couldn't imagine waiting 15 minutes to eat). And then you burned yourself on the pan when you pulled them out, but you were too stoned to feel the pain (although you were quite certain you were going to feel it in the morning). Do you remember how, after just a few bites of what might just be the nastiest thing you ever ate, you threw them in the garbage and thought to yourself, ""What's the use? What's the point to all of this? Why do I even bother? Why do I even go on"" And when you woke up late the next afternoon, you went straight down to the registrar's office and changed your major to philosophy. Then you started getting drunk and smoking pot every night with that long-haired old guy who hangs out at the bar, the guy who never showers and always hits on the freshmen girls who sneak in on the weekends; only to find yourself dropping out of college a few months later because you just couldn't disseminate the intellectual struggle between being and nothingness, and your professors were just too stupid to understand you. And now, 20 years later, you're living back home in your parents house, unable to keep a job and drinking away your paycheck every night in that same college bar. And when you look at yourself in the broken bathroom mirror you suddenly realize that you have become that old, smelly drunk who still hits on college girls. And you look back at your life and think to yourself - ""If only I'da skipped those fries, everything in my life would be different now."" Trust me, those fries were gourmet compared to In-N-Out Burger's. They tasted like powdery, freezer burned match-sticks that had been reheated under a heat lamp - it was difficult to tell if they were made from potatoes or from some Star Trek food simulator machine. My burger was equally disgusting. It is fair to say the only part of the burger that did not suck was the lettuce. The bun was stale and dry, the browned skin of the bun's top peeled off like 60 year old wallpaper from an old pickle factory, leaving what looked and tasted like a frozen bun that was thawed on high in the microwave.. I have nothing to complain about with the vanilla shake - at last, nothing to complain about. In all told, my last visit to In-N-Out Burger was as disappointing as anything you could imagine. My guess is, there IS a limit to how much you can cut-back on quality just to save a dime. It's a shame for such an iconic brand. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Pure and simple. The design and layout of the place is pure white, clean lines, and you just feel so...pure ...when you walk in. Is this what heaven looks like? Pure has been here for 7 months, after the success of its North location at Greyhawk, which has been operating for three years. The speakers pump out a steady stream of Miami south beach beats, you feel like you are in a trendy lounge, rather than a sushi bar and restaurant. Best time to come here is during happy hour-3:00-6:30 every day of the week. Select sushi and rolls are nearly half the price, as well as items from the kitchen such as coconut shrimp and asian chicken salad.. $5 wells and 3 olives vodkas, beer, and sake. Glasses of wine are 1/2 off. $2 edamame and miso, $4-$7 rolls such as the eel avacado roll (excellent) or the albacore ceviche roll. I am a big fan of the ""in and out roll"" which is shrimp tempura, spicy crab mix, and cucumber, topped with shrimp and sliced avocado - and served with an asian pesto sauce. I was not a fan of the spicy ponzu dressing on their Spicy seafood salad, but it was laden with fresh sashimi of tuna, yellowtail, salmon, shrimp and octopus, then finished with smelt eggs and bonito flakes. On the happy hour menu for $7, regulary $12. Things that I love about PURE: the design, the ambiance, and a selection of their unique rolls. Things that make it just like any other sushi joint: virtually the entire menu Service: my two visits to this place have been great in terms of service. Wait staff is really knowledgeable about all things sushi and more, there is one person dedicated to keeping you hydrated, one to keeping your table clutter-free, and one to show you where the bathroom is. no complaints on this end. I loved that everybody working there today said goodbye to us and wished us a great weekend. That little bit of TLC goes a long way to win my patronage. Why I would come back: a) for atmosphere. b) for bananas about their sake list! wow! all the specific gravities you love, from sweet to dry. I recommend the Moonston Lemongrass Coconut, non-filltered sake. And my second favorite, the ZIPANG. this is a sweet bubbly version of sake. so, yeah, I am no ""purist"" when it comes to sake, i like pizzazz. c) for coming soon is the lounge upstairs! Why I would not come back: The food doesn't speak to me Blue Wasabi's Happy Hour is better, and their rolls so much more fun The quality of the sushi is great, the recipes just aren't ",0,0,1,0,0

 After seeing this place on a ton of top ice cream places in the US, I finally got to try it out when I was in Scottsdale for a meeting.

I settled on the salted butter caramel and asked for the complimentary sea salt topping. I was expecting the normal white crystals or flakes, but it turned out to be this awesome black sea salt!

 Polished offers a really cool concept for a nail salon. Unfortunately my experience just did not live up to my expectations. I'm hoping my experience was the exception and not the rule! I was rushed through both the mani and pedi. The massage portion for both services lasted about 1 minute and I'm fairly certain the pedicure only took 15 minutes total. When it came time for the shellac manicure the lady helping me didn't think it was necessary to remove my ring, she said she could work around it...clearly I was in for another short massage. After she put on the final top coat I put my hand in the little UV box. When I exclaimed that my nails felt like they were burning she said, ""I know."" Like that's normal! I've had plenty of shellac manicures and have never had that experience. Maybe it was just a brand I've never used before? I'll give this place one more try. I hope it's better next time around!

 Poorly understaffed, rude staff, mediocre food, grossly underestimate the wait time and SMALL. This is supposed to be the hotel's 24 hour restaurant and yet probably 1/3 the size of the MGM hotel groups 24 hour restaurants. Save yourself and head over to Cafe Bellagio. I came to this place simply because I love Michel RIchard's pastries. I went in, asked what the wait for two would be and was told 20-30 minutes. Very well, I strolled through the shops and came back. Again, I saw a longer line and was told ""another 30 minutes."" At this point, I should have left but instead I stayed in the area and waited. 50 minutes of waiting I had had enough and went to the manager. A man by the name of Xavier and another younger man came and told me it's because the the 7-star and diamond casino guests have priority....OKAY, SO DON'T LIE ABOUT THE WAIT TIME! Still, we were taken to the back of the dining room (with about 7 empty tables near us) and sat down. I ordered a creme brulee french toast and voila after 10 minutes a cold dish appeared. GUESS WHAT I FOUND IN IT? PLASTIC!! And this was nothing small, literally 6 inches of it. I quickly called over the manager, he was not so shocked, I knew the plastic was for pre-packaged food which pissed me off even more and he asked if I wanted anything else instead... I said let me see the menu. I ordered a sandwich because I didn't want to go wait anywhere else and a cold, mediocre Club sandwich arrived. On my bill I saw I was being charged for the sandwich and this urks me so I call over Xavier again...his manager says to me: ""Well when he asked if you want anything you did not reply so you agreed to pay for it yourself"" Seeing as how I was not one to be argued with he took the bill and I left.

 Walking into this restaurant is quite nice, the decor is nice and they are cooking paella over wood fire in the back which is nice to look at and leaves a great aroma throughout the whole place. Unfortunately I do not remember all of the exact items we had when I dined here, but I know that almost everything we got was delicious. I had two food problems when we were there. First was the roasted pepper and eggplant tasted more bitter than roasted. Second, In my opinion the grapefruit in the lobster salad was too strong and killed the flavor of the lobster meat. The restaurant has been described as vibrant and fun but when we went there it was packed and a bit too loud to hold a conversation at our table without shouting.

 Tried this location for the first time on Father's Day. That in and of itself was a mistake as the place was extremely busy and required a 50 minute wait (hostess said 15-20 min). In the meanwhile we checked the place out and reviewed the menu to determine our order. Finally seated and our waiter takes our order - brings us back our drinks and then disappears. Our coffee and soda's go dry. The table behind us locates their own condiments and refills. Oh, look our waiter returns - long enough to give us a refill and tell us he was bored. Yesterday was evidently much busier and today isn't even a challenge for him. WOW! So our order comes out and we have to give directions on what needs corrected. We wait while he re-does my wife's order. Which then comes out cold and still isn't correct. Seriously? I was told how big the sandwiches are, so I ordered a half pastrami, thinking the $8 price tag isn't really as much as it seems, since the sandwich will be the size of a ""regular"" size sandwich. Um, yeah, that part didn't pan out. I got a small sandwich piled high pastrami and a little cup of cole slaw. The food itself was good, not great like the hype. Our waiter - yeah, he's missing again and we get no refills. I also noticed management was MIA. He returns long enough to give us the check. There's a mistake on the bill, which he corrects but we of course have to wait and wait. My final opinion? Too expensive for the sandwich I had and breakfast everyone else in my party had. The food is good but the price to quantity ratio is off. If this place didn't have the fanboys it does, I'd say it was doomed, particularly in today's more cost conscious economy. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Outside seating only, which leads to some entertaining people-watching. The other customers at the restaurant when we came by for some comida included three potential drug dealers, a guy who wandered up wearing a marijuana shirt, and a woman who left the possible dealers angrily shouting ""You can shut the f*$# up, I am the bride of Jesus Christ!"" as she wandered off down the street. The tables in the seating area hadn't been cleaned recently, and cups containing some strange liquid were sitting on our table as we ate. That said, we had some very friendly service at the window, and my cheese enchiladas were acceptable for the price we paid. My husband's carne asada was probably not made from the best cut of steak, since it was chopped up into small pieces instead of being served as a strip.

 After reading all the positive reviews, I was very disappointed when we had dinner here. Service was marginally acceptable, though slow and we often had to flag down the server. I had Chicken of the Angels, and it was VERY salty. It was supposed to be served over mushrooms and artichokes, though my meal had one piece of one artichoke! The side of asparagus were ordered to shared was ice cold - and barely enough for one person. One person in my party ordered a steak medium (pink) and it was definitely well done. The baked potato was huge, and ice cold on the inside but steaming on the outside. At a restaurant like this (and for these prices) I shouldn't have to ask for a wine list, and the server should ask if we want a second round of drinks.

 Los Gringos is a good place to stop before heading out on the Apache Trail. My husband and I stopped by the family-owned place and ordered up some delicious tex-mex style food.

Friendly service - and check out the electronic ordering pads! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I helped broker a visit by this company to a friend of mine who is disabled. I called Joey and he said he'd take special care of my friend. When my friend balked at the price, Joey said he ""negotiated"" a special deal because of his disabilities. Then he delivered a much cheaper safe than he had promised and charged twice as much as it was worth at any other safe shop. After my friend realized he did not get the safe he expected, he tried to call Joey and arrange a return. Joey hung up on my friend and then would not answer or return his calls. Shame on Joey for taking advantage of the disabled. Beware the use of cryptic model numbers to bait and switch. This is not a guy I'd like to know that I had valuables. ",0,1,0,0,0

 A great tapas bar with many menu choices. I actually went down to Southern Highlands for Uncle Al's hot dogs, but to my dismay, the place was closed. Not sure if Closed down or closed, but I didn't see any food in the place (ketchup, mustard, etc). So, I ended up at Barcelona. Let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised with the food, service and ""drank."" Let's break this down into categories. Food: Pan Fried Dates - Excellent and highly recommended. For those that have been to Firefly's, they are essentially the same. Bacon wrapped dates, with Blue Cheese. Sliders - Sliders come as 2 mini burgers and are just fine. Of course, I always say you can't ruin a burger that much when they are so simple. Abodingos (sp?) AKA Meatballs - Tasty little guys come in a marinara like sauce with lots of cheese. Empanadas - There are two types to choose from. I had the chicken, but the alternative is Pork. Chicken was chosen because my friend doesn't eat pork. However, the chicken empanadas were excellent. Fruit Parfait - The parfait was sweet and tasty. Raspberry, Strawberry and blueberries, with whip cream and a sweet yogurt like mixture. Sangria - Thursday night is 1/2 off Sangria night. This means it's $3 per glass. Not too shabby and a good sized glass too. Atmosphere: I have mixed feelings on the atmosphere. Walls were great, but the tables were a bit small for me and I am only 6'2"". My knees hit the top of the tables. However, there were booths that looked like they had more room. It was a Lakers game night so it was rowdy because we were the only Lakers fans in the place. Every else was for Boston. :-( Service: Food was fast, and service was excellent. It was more personal then most places. Waiter recommended, talked about the game, chit chatted and more. Pan frie dates. Sliders. Meatballs. Parfait for dessert. Empanadas. Full bar, somewhat interesting atmosphere. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Dropped in here relatively late on a Saturday evening for a fast dinner for five, but it turned out to be nearly an all-night ordeal. The service was just awful, what with an inexperienced waiter and staffing that did not match the number of people on a Saturday night. Our order was simple- burgers, etc., but it took nearly a half hour to be served. The restaurant is relatively large but only one small area was open to guests and that made it very loud and gave a crowded feeling to dinner. When we did get our order, there was little or no follow-up with more coffee, etc. The evening was full of apologies and reassurances. It may have been a fluke, but that evening, the place was not even up to the moderate service standard at most Coco's. The coconut custard pie was excellent, though, when it finally arrived. I'd give them another try, I suppose, but there are lots of other places in Phoenix. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It's a step up from in-and-out but nothing special. The hamburger was decent and they had a good selection of sides but the burger itself was nothing I have to go back for. I only went to see what my co-workers were raving about. It's not bad, just not as good as fatburger. You take all the sides, options, and other crap and it's an average burger that tasted the same as a cheaper burger chain. ",0,0,1,0,0

 So currently the hubby and I are in the process of buying a house. We had to drive out to North Scottsdale to sign some paperwork and since we were in the area we stopped in at The Skeptical Chymist for dinner and drinks. I found the price of food and drinks to be slightly pricey and that would be my only complaint about this place. The food however is very tasty. I ordered the fish and chips and my husband ordered the mustard crusted tenderloin stuffed with spinach. I got a bit of food envy when I tasted my husbands food. I would recommend ordering that dish. The fish and chips were decent. You get a big beer battered filet which is nicely seasoned with thick chips. Being a proud Irish lass I enjoy Irish pubs that actually play great Irish music and Skeptical Chymist does a great job. Sure you hear the cliche, popular bands like U2 and The Cranberries, but they also played The Pogues and some traditional Irish songs. The place had a great look and feel to it. They really made it look as close to a traditional Irish pub and I felt really comfortable just hanging out and drinking my Smithwicks. On this particular evening the place was pretty sparse, not many people, but I'm sure on weekends this place gets hoppin'. The fact that this place played The Pogues should warrant a five star review, but because I find the prices to be slightly high they only get four stars. I would definitley go back if I'm in the neighborhood again. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Favorite coffee shop in Phoenix right here. Where do I begin with my love for this place? Their iced toddy is mind-blowing. No coffee has ever jump started my day the way this stuff does. It is smooth, delicious and full of caffeination. This place gets major brownie points for having almond milk. Thank God I don't have to ever have another latte with dairy or soy. Their iced chai with almond milk will change your life and it makes their toddy that much smoother. Their food is delectable. They have Tammie Coe everything and if you haven't tried Tammie Coe cakes, you're missing out. I haven't tried a cupcake, muffin or breakfast sandwich I didn't like (make sure you try a breakfast croissant sandwich with turkey bacon. Earth shattering good.) Last but definitely not least, their customer service is epic. I have the best convos with these guys and they're always ready to suggest good teas to match my mood or go above and beyond to make my drink perfect. They're like my neighborhood friends. What more could you ask for from a place? The owners of BCCH have done everything right! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Food was ok. Hummus, baba, pita, and lentil soup were fantastic. My chicken schwarma on rice was very dry. Desserts were good, with the exception of the chocolate mousse. Service was poor, our waitess regularly forgot to bring things out, which can be looked past. The real kicker was we couldn't get water if we offered to pay for it. She often disappeared or wouldn't stop by for lengthy periods of time. At one point, after dessert, we started rationing water among the remaining glasses at the table because it was obvious we weren't going to get any from her any time soon. And this was on a wednesday night when it wasn't even that busy. The chef was nice enough to come to our table and check up a few times. All in all, decent food, but wouldn't go back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My husband and I stayed at the Valley Ho for 2 nights and loved it. The staff was great. The property is well cared for. We were there Monday-Wednesday so I can't speak for the weekend crowd but everyone from guests to bartenders and servers were nice and having Fun! We stayed in a Cabana Suite and grabbed carry out for several meals just because it was so relaxing to sit on the patio with a bottle of wine and eat. There is a nice Circle K across the street for snacks, beer...etc. They have some decent drink specials at the pool bar on weekdays and a nice Happy Hour at ZuZu (the restaurant on site) so you do not feel like you are getting ripped off every time you order a drink.

 So, of all of the times that I've compared other restaurants to Switch, I just realized that I've not written a review of them. Unfortunately for them, this review comes after a string of bad service that was peppered with great service. To start, I live 3 blocks south of here, so this place is a staple restaurant for us. If I work late and don't feel like cooking, if my sister drops by (she lives on the other side of Central from me) and we just need a quick bite or if we're craving one of their scrumptious sandwiches that are made with high quality ingredients. They've also got a great wine selection. The one thing they lack is consistency (with regards to service). I brought some clients and a co-worker here a few weeks back for a business lunch. The service that day was spot-on. The hostess recognized me from a few nights earlier and promptly greeted and sat us. Our server was super attentive and the food was Magnificent (yes, with a big M). A few days later, the pair of us + my sister and nephew stopped in for a meal and asked about the new recession plate. Now, this server was new, so there was no reason for her to be bitter and jaded when we ordered 3 recession plates, one roll with no butter (for the kid) and 3 high end glasses of wine. The wine came, the food came (and it was Delicious with a big D) but our server never came back by. I had to flag her down to get the check, as we all decided that the service didn't rate a second glass of wine or desert. And for the 1st time in a long time, I only left 15% tip. See how mixed my review was? Kind of a perplexing situation I am in. I doubt I'll take anymore clients/co-workers here for a business lunch, but I'm sure I'll end up walking through the doors for another Scrumptious meal. And if the service sucks, I won't order extras (wine, 2nd or 3rd glass of wine, desert...). ",0,0,1,0,0

 MMM nice creamy ice cream! I really enjoyed this place and the nostalgic feeling i got with the small wooden spoons. I am on the upward mailing list so i received a free b-day dessert and i got a triple scoop of Vietnamese coffee. Um not quite Vietnamese coffee flavor, but it was a good coffee/espresso flavor in general. I really liked the creaminess of the ice-cream even though i can honestly say i kinda like a little bit more icy texture instead. Regardless the flavors i tried were pretty darn good. The cookies were just okay. My sister and brother in law got an ice-cream sandwich. (between two cookies). I mean it is no urban cookie ice-cream sandwich, but it hits the spot. It'd be better if the cookies had some outstanding deliciousness. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they are better, but they may have been sitting there for a little bit. so you ask me the simple question... ""you gonna be back?""...to that i respond in the words of storage wars....YUUUPPPP!! ",0,0,1,0,0

 The food here is beyond terrible and overpriced. I honestly don't see how people are actually giving this place decent ratings. The staff brings EVERTHING and that included the to go boxes out on a bus cart. The salad (if you can even call it that) had no green in it whatsoever. It consisted of only the inside pieces of iceburg lettuce mixed with what I think might be trying to pass as ham. All though my dinner companion theorized that it may be catagorized as spam or bologna. The pizza was covered in burnt cheeze and the crust was undercooked. It was so tough you couldn't bite into it, instead it had to be cut with a steak knife. Their Italian beef sandwich was cold and the meat was completely dry. The fact that we were there at what should be peak dining hours on a Saturday evening and the place was totally empty should speak for itself on the popularity of this place. I honestly can't say that I've ever had worse Italian food ever in my life. If you want good Chicago style pizza drive a few more minutes east to Old Chicago Pizza. At least there you won't have to worry about an upset stomach the next day. ",1,0,0,0,0

 In some circles, referred-to simply as ""The Palace,"" this place has a solid lunch buffet and good service. Priced at about $10 per person for a variety of good Indian food, it's a lunch-time slam dunk every time... although adding a couple more dishes to the mix would be ideal. It's an OK value for dinner, although, in my opinion, slightly overpriced for good, but not out of this world, Indian. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Most Montrealers are St-Viateur fans or Fairmount fans. Personally I fall into the St-Viateur category. They have a small selection of flavours but I prefer it that way. I'm also a fan of the wood-burning oven they use to make them as well as the fact that they boil them in honey water. I always load up on sesame seed and poppy seed bagels when I'm in the area. The best part too is that they make them all day long so they're usually very fresh when you pick them up. It's next to impossible not to eat one on the way home and your car is filled with the aroma of freshly baked bagels as you drive home. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place was fabulous - the best Thai I've had in Pittsburgh so far. Some of the best anywhere, truly! We came on a Sunday night around 6 pm, and there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant. We got a table out on the sidewalk to enjoy the beautiful weather and people watching. We didn't feel like boozing, so we only had water and didn't B our OB, but we'd love to come back with a bottle of wine in the future. We started with the green papaya salad, which neither of us had ever eaten but I know it's basically a staple of Thai cuisine. I would highly recommend it as a fresh, light appetizer. It is spicy (we asked for everything to be level 3 spicy = ""American Spicy""), but it certainly wasn't too much to handle. You can very clearly taste all the flavor components - sweet, spicy, sour, salty - and they blended beautifully. Love the crunchy peanuts and tang from fish sauce. Then we got the Massaman Curry with lamb, and then we got something off their ""authentic"" menu - it isn't on the regular printed menu, but it IS on the paper take out menus. I have no idea what it was called, but it consisted of pork belly and tiger prawns over glass noodles in a gingery broth, cooked in a clay pot. Wow. The curry was just incredible - the rich sauce was one of the best examples of Massaman curry I've ever eaten. We both loved it. The lamb was fork tender, and the dish was really divine. The ""authentic"" clay pot dish was great too - served VERY hot, fresh off the coals. It took a long time for it to cool enough to be eaten. It was delightfully savory, with a soothing, special flavor that was lovely when the sauce coated the noodles. The pork belly was extremely fatty - honestly, it literally seemed like pieces of pork fat, nothing more. I know that it's a very fatty cut of meat, but I'm pretty sure I've eaten it elsewhere and had at least *some* meat - these pieces were nothing but fat. Tasty fat, but fat nonetheless. The shrimp were tender and lovely though, and the broth was beautifully seasoned. The prices were very similar to Bangkok Balcony and other upscale Thai places. Massaman was $16, and I forget how much the authentic dish was....$14 I think? Still, the quality is really excellent and I think it's worth the price. I'd love to get takeout from here sometime. This was a 4 1/2 star review easily, I think with a repeated excellent visit it could be bumped up to a 5. Great addition to Highland! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have been craving good Thai and remembered this place from years ago. We arrived right at 5 and ordered quickly. I am a purist; I love Pad Thai with lots of peanut sauce and Summer Rolls. My friends had Spring Rolls, Satay, and Tom Yum. We ate family-style and thought the meal was good So here's where they lost me: we finished our meal and the check arrived. We were not asked I'd we wanted dessert or anything else. At the one-hour mark, the owner came over and asked us to leave . She had people waiting for tables, but there were plenty of empty tables so we were confused but paid up an left. So. There you have it. The food is decent but the way we were treated left something to be desired. I did see people doing takeout . That might be an idea for folks in the neighborhood but I'll have to find a place that lets me have dessert and coffee and relax a bit. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Today I made a venture into the newly renovated food court of Arizona Mills. Of course I bypassed the salad bar and shocking to even myself the Froyo place and went straight for what I was hoping to be the spicy selection at Tinta Mexicana. I quickly checked over their list of items, tacos, burritos, and bowls a bit limited but hey it's mall food. Upon first glance I was thinking this is just another Chipotle in disguise, but Tinta Mexicana has something they do not, Bacon wrapped Hot Dogs! Need I say anymore? I got the Sonoran, but did it my way. I just could not see a tasty bacon dog smothered in mayo, ketchup and mustard as the menu suggested. You have your choice of brown or black beans, and onion mixed with cilantro. I skipped the onion cilantro mix, as to spare others upon my return to the office. Now if they had cilantro alone, I would have gone for it. I asked to replace my condiments with their spicy salsa, of which was not spicy at all but still flavorful. The service was a bit slow on the uptake, but they are fairly new and perhaps still working the kinks out. All in all for around $4.50, a pretty good deal. I'll be back, I mean c'mon they've got Bacon! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Overall rating is 1.5 stars out of 5. When my wife and arrived at our hotel in Vegas on 05/16/13 we were quite hungry and ready for lunch. After a brief discussion we decided, we would get our bags situated in our room first and then head to this restaurant mainly because of it's proximity and because our stomachs talking to us lol. When we arrived at the entrance we were immediately greeted by the hostess and quickly escorted to our seats (So far so good). Now here is where it starts to go down hill (Just a mental reminder that this place was not busy at all during this time). Ok so my wife and I sat at the table for well over 20 minutes before a guy finally arrived and asked us our drink orders. We quickly told him what we wantef to drink because by this time we already knew what we wanted for lunch. When I proceeded to tell him what we wanted to order he said, ""Your server will be with you shortly"" (Well that was a bold face lie). After about 5 minutes the guy brings out our drinks and some bread with butter for us to eat. This bread was awful and its not so much because of taste but more so because the outer part of the bread was hard like rocks. So we thought we could bypass that by eating the soft inside which we found out was not even room temperature this bread was cold. So we ended not eating the bread. I say about another 20-25 minutes later our server arrives to take our order (FINALLY!). After finally placing our order (The Paris Burger w/ Fries) that took another 15-20 minutes to finally get delivered to our table. The good thing is that when the food finally came it was pretty good. The fries were pretty good and I like how the top bum of the burger was cooked. The edge of the buns had a crispy texture while the rest of the bun still remained sofT. Overall the burger was not life changing but still a decent burger and the fries were good as well. In the end the reason for the low rating is because service was extremely SLOW and the bread was not good at all either (Some people might like that but not me). The sad thing is that this place seems to be packed with people later in the evening however because of this experience I do not think I'll be coming back to this until maybe my next trip to Vegas. There are just too many restaurants and places to explore to be fixated on this one. Maybe next time Le Cafe. Hey maybe you guys might have better look with service. Good Luck. ",1,0,0,0,0

 What a strange bunch of reviews for this restaurant. Of course, you always get a few people who had a bad experience, sometimes because of something the restaurant did and sometimes because they just had a bad day. And of course you always find a few people who LOVE everything. But the mixture here makes me wonder if there aren't two restaurants named Ajo Al's at this address, or perhaps a time warp, virtual reality, or witch's spell. The truth is -- Ajo Al's is an average old-school Mexican restaurant. The chips are ok, the salsa is ok, meaning if you are hungry you'll eat them. Some of the entrees are good, but you have to know what to order. I recommend the chicken enchilada, which is overflowing with white meat chicken. Some entrees are just decent, like the beef tamale -- lots of beef filling but it had a lackluster flavor. The beef tacos are ok, the rice is ok, the whole beans are ok. If you just need a quick fix of standard Mexican, and Ajo Al's is conveniently nearby, I don't think you will be seriously offended. If you want anything more, this is not your burrito, amigo.

 I signed up specifically to review this hotel. I have been staying at the Pointe hotels since I was a child. My mother had her wedding reception dinner here nearly 30 years ago. It's not the nicest resort in town, but it's usually a good value and always fun for all. That being said, 7/8/2010 will be the last stay for any of my family at either of the Pointe resorts. First of all, I booked a two bedroom casita in March and prepaid for it so it would be a reduced rate. It ended up being $20 less then the actual rate but oh well! At least I had the security of knowing I had the room. Living in Arizona, summer birthdays are not always easy- it's so hot. It has been our tradition to celebrate my birthday and now my daughters birthday at the Pointe Resorts. The staff has always been accomodating to guests and making us feel special. Yesterday was Cassidys 2nd birthday. We booked the casita specifically so we would have room for both grandmas to stay and a little room for some family and friends to enjoy Cassidys birthday. When we arrived- my pre-booked casita was not available. They told me I had only booked the queen one. I found the confirmation and they realized they were in err. ""Ok, that's indeed what you booked, but We don't have one available right now. They are cleaning the downstairs portion of the casita but you may enter thru the king entrance and we will let you know when it's ready."" Well, at least I have the room right? So we decide to do this. When we unloaded all of our belongings and entered the open portion of the casita, it was cramped to say the least. But at least it was cool. But there were 6 of us with some other family on the way. I asked the maid to put my cake in the fridge downstairs. I got a glimpse of the downstairs portion and was in shock. Someone had a major party on there the night before- like furniture overturned, bottles everywhere, sticky floors- an absolute disaster. No way would these two poor maids get this cleaned up by 5. I vaguely remember the front desk guy saying the guests who were there had a late checkout. Yea, I see why;) We call the desk and to my surprise, we were moved- to a 2-bedroom casita right across the way! But why not in the first place? Before we'd unloaded our things, etc. But the front desk did say they would help up carry our things across the car port. And that we were closer to the pool! Wow! Super nice bell boy came and helped us out. We were settled by 5:30- but that hour and a half of unsettlement for my daughter was not good. If you have or have had a two year old you know what I mean;) When my husband called the desk this AM- we wanted a late checkout and maybe just an apology,he was given the run around by a very rude manager. They didn't do late checkouts(HMMMM) Did we want to stay another night in a suite room for $69? LOL at that(they had a coupon for next stay in a suite room for $79.) I got on the phone and told him the same story I've just told and he laughed at me several times and mocked me when I said I am a service manager at a large corporation and I usually don't complain. He mocked me about having children. His tone of voice was sarcastic. He was absolutely awful. He said that the GM was too busy to help us and wouldn't be available to talk. They also charged us for phone calls when we had paid for the value pack. Including the long distance one when I asked him for the corporate #. And do they not have a 1-800#? I didn't expect much, but I don't expect to be laughed at. Absolutely unacceptable. I see in reviews on here and trip advisor they have service issues. The water park was dirty and unattended to. Service/Food in park. -so so. I used to love this place and I'm sorry that a tradition is over. Oh well, I'll go to the AZ Grand next year. Don't stay here. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I am going to go against the grain here and give this a 2 not because some of the stuff is not really nice, but I just feel that it is a bit meh... I have lived just up the road for about 10 years - off and on, and have been a regular at victor hugo for all that time, but this latest incarnation has failed from the start. I must say, I do like their hot rolls and their danishes, and the coffee is ok but the service is PAINFULLY slow - over 15 minutes to make 4 americanos - and we were 2nd in the queue! There just doesn't seem to be a 'system' or order to the place. I would also say that the small amount of fresh produce is really a bit sorry, the limes were so withered and just not what I would expect from such a place. Yes, the hot food is good, but (and I might be wrong) I feel that a lot of the stuff is bought in - the cakes and the sandwich fillings in particular. There are nice products to buy, but they seem to have all been picked just because they have a taste award or some award given to them. I don't really get the feeling that they use the local potential as much as a 'foodie' shop like that should be doing. Additionally, although a lot of the products are decent, many of them are not particularly unique - they are availible in supermarkets or other Edinburgh delis for less \ u00a3 \ u00a3 \ u00a3. If I am making up a hamper for someone, I would possibly look in here for inspiration because it is handy, but I know from experience that I generally use Demijohn for my oils and places such as Clark's and Mellis for chutneys and cheese.

 I stopped in last night for a drink with a group of friends... we were in town visiting and I had been wanting to try this place out since we walked past it on the last trip... what a disappointment. The server was prompt to greet us and drop off drink menus, but then she failed to return to take our order for at least 20 minutes. It would've been different if she had been slammed, but the entire time she was standing by the bar, just talking to her coworkers. By the time she came to take our order we were ready to leave... and we should have... the martinis were not good and the server's disposition left much to be desired. When we were ready to leave she made us feel like it was a bother to split our tabs between the five of us. The one positive of the place was that I liked the ambiance, but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else being lackluster. What I was hoping to be a great ending to the night turned into a dismal experience that put everyone in a bad mood. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I have visited this location many times however my most recent experience was horrible. It started with their signs on the door stating TAKE OUT ONLY ENTER THROUGH PATIO. The wording was a little off and confusing. We read it as take out orders are to enter through the patio. We walked in to the restaurant to discover it was all closed off. At first we thought they were closed and only accepting take out orders. Then we saw people standing by the patio so we walked back there. We stood in front of the host podium where there were 3 employees and a security guard who were all carrying on a conversation about one of the girls who was pregnant. Never were we greeted. We had to wait until their conversation was over. Then we asked if they were open (since the wording on the signs was vague). Instead of saying yes she immediately asked how many people we needed a table for in a rude snappy manner. Clearly there were only 2 of us there with a little baby. So she had someone bring us inside and the guy brought us a high chair as we requested. Well then we were told we would need to put the high chair on the inside of the table and not in the aisle. Understandable but the place our table was located when the table behind us was sat the man behind my son was backed up to the high chair causing barely any room. If the position of the high chair was such an issue why didn't they put us at a normal table. Our server was very sweet and nice. Seemed she was fairly new at serving but she was always smiley and kind. I have always ordered the Cajun Quesadilla and enjoyed it however this time the chicken was very sparse in the tortilla and there was a weird taste to the meal over all. I would recommend BWW to anyone however I feel the tactics of this particular visit were sub par and need to be reviewed. Also, do not try and visit this restaurant when there is a big fight on PPV or a big sporting event because you will not be allowed in unless you are there for that event. ",0,1,0,0,0

 ### (03/05/2014) ###: I finally had a chance to come back to vegas and was dying for the Riserva. They had the nearly 1 year aged NY Strip which was super flavorful and amazingly good. The aroma and beef flavor was intense! I went back the next two days and finally on the 2nd day they had the Ribeye Riserva available! Bells and little cupids starting flying around my head. As you can see in my pictures the 8 1/2 month aged ribeye was masterfully carved out by my table. Every part of the ribeye was great such as the eye and the cap itself which is usually the most marbleized part and my favorite. Out of the 3 types I had (NY Strip, porterhouse and Ribeye) the ribeye is definitely the best out of the three is probably why it's almost never available! The steak was cooked perfectly the three times I went as a medium rare and topped off with some sea salt. The last time I came here 1.5 years ago it was overcooked 2 out of 4 times. I usually eat it with some ketchup & mustard mixed to help cut through the flavor a bit every few bites. Overall the service and food was incredible. I can't wait to go again for my 4th time and final day in vegas. Highly recommended everyone try this at least once in their life! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've been coming here off and on since they first opened up, near Deer Valley. From the beginning to now the beer has improved drastically. In the beginning, it wasn't drinkable. I tried it on several occasions and it was either an extremely weak representation of the style, or suffered from terrible after taste. ( think contamination) However, a few years have gone by, and they've moved sites. The move seems to have helped, as the brew was solid on style and taste. I'm relieved as I really want to see this place thrive. The atmosphere is relaxed and the bartender was knowledgeable. Not my first, or even second choice for a beer, but if I am in the area, I won't hesitate to stop in. Support your local brewer. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Laura the best waitress in the valley is back at Jerry's she is there every night but Sunday and Monday. This place rocks again. The best late night place to go, great food, and with Laura back the best service around, as far as I am concerned every waitress in the world should go and watch her work you could definitely learn a few things. If I were to open my own restaurant this women would be running the show. To the owners and management of Jerry's you better take care of this lady. ",0,0,0,0,1

 DO NOT EVER RENT A VEHICLE FROM BUDGET. I recently rented thru Kayak.com and it was supposedly for less than $30/day. I booked it for 7 days but returned it a day and 3 hours later. They charged me $175.36. I called customer service to tell them they charged me more than what I should have been charged. The lady told me that the vehicle was for $45/day and that I never booked the rental with Kayak.com for the lower price of less than $30/day even though my receipt clearly shows I reserved from Kayak.com. She tells me this is a valid charge and I was charged $22.50 per hour for the 3 hours. That's almost double for a days worth or renting! I asked why wouldn't they just charge me two days and not a day and 3 hours? She had no answer. So if you rent from Budget, make sure you return it in 24 hour increments. Otherwise you could be charged 23 (hours) multiplied by $22.50 which comes out to $517.50 for 23 hours of renting their vehicle. PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF SOME HEADACHE AND DO NOT RENT FROM BUDGET. Their are better places to rent a car from. I give them no stars but was required to give at least one. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Great place to go with a big group for something different than just heading out to the bars. I've been to the original one in Munich, and its American incarnation was pretty much along the same lines--beer, table-dancing (well, bench-dancing) to cheesy songs that everyone knows the words to, and lots of fun. As far as beer goes, I wasn't big on their Weizen (wheat beer) and I'm not a fan of lagers in general. Love their Dunkel though, so I always order that. Most of my friends always get the light beer...no comment. Food here isn't very good. Zucchini planks are the only thing I like (huge portion, good for snacking with a group). All the meat dishes are extremely dry and heavy on the salt. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this as a dinner/drinking combo. Eat elsewhere, then come here to drink. Another negative, the place gets way too crowded. If you come before 10pm, there will be an obscene wait for a table (and it's not fun if you don't get a table). Sometimes table reservations will be booked for the night as early as 7pm. Come late, and you can usually find some friendly strangers to jump in with. It's a little bit of a hassle to come here on a regular basis, but for birthdays or other special occassions, it's a great spot. ",0,0,1,0,0

 On a normal day I would describe this park as: A rather small amusement park located on an island in the city of Montreal, where the pricing is average, the rides are average, the food is average, hell the whole park is pretty much average. On Halloween however the park comes to life, with special haunted houses and people walking around in costume. The one negative thing about that is however, that you have to pay extra for the haunted houses..even when you have a season pass. Conclusion: It's alright, not a magical adventure, but it's something to do when you're bored and have the extra cash. Personally, I'd stick to only going on/around Halloween, it's way more fun.

 Maybe Jet Blue has spoiled me. I fly Jet Blue to Oakland a couple times a year and my flight has never left late. Last time I flew to Vegas it was Jet Blue and once again on time. So last week I go to Vegas for a convention and have to go with my co-workers and they all wanted to fly out of John Wayne/Orange County and not my beloved Long Beach Airport. So we had to deal with US Airways. At our flight departure time of 11:15 am our plane wasn't even at the gate yet. By the time we boarded and got in the air it was already past our arrival time. I had exactly 3 minutes and 45 seconds to drink my soda before being told they had to pick it up because the plane was preparing to land. Our arrival was 1 hour and 15 minutes late with no offers of apologies and no explanations. One star for not crashing and one for a cheap ticket. But next time I'll be flying Jet Blue. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The coffee is smooth and delicious, not to mention delicately brewed and roasted on site. The staff is always friendly eager to help you to make an informed decision about your drink, and I have yet to get a smug look from any of them when I feign ignorance about any drinks. That little test tells me an awful lot about an establishment, and it goes without saying that, while Cartel is a coffee connoisseur's delight, it works just as well for those who might not have a handle on the finer details of this art. If there's anything to complain about this fine establishment, it's that there's always a crowd, lending it to being a less than ideal setting to sit and relax, due to a dearth in seating. But if you can find a spot to plop down, you're in perhaps the finest coffee establishment in all of Arizona. That's not an exaggeration. ",0,0,0,0,1

 If the Wicked Spoon is the best buffet this town has to offer, I'm glad I won't be wasting my time on others (not that I'm in vegas much). Maybe because I'm not that into buffets in general- I highly prefer quality to quantity- but there really wasn't anything that impressed me. Here's what I tried and a review of each: Cheese: I'll start out that the cheese board was fine. So I ate a lot of cheese. Kale salad: I love kale but it was DROWNED in dressing Beets: Either out of a can or boiled beyond recognition. Bland and gross. Wild Boar with Asiago Gnocchi: I had high hopes on this one but it tasted- honest to god- like Chef Boyardee beefaroni. California roll: I did it, I tried sushi at a buffet and it was exactly what I expected- inedible. Shrimp cocktail: Edible, but so is shrimp cocktail from Walmart. At least the shrimp weren't bad. Goat Cheese Panna Cotta: Probably the only thing on the menu I'd go back for seconds on. Everything looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamps baking for hours. They seem to get credit for putting food in little containers, which only means they pay many low-wage workers when perhaps they could just get better chefs and put things in a vat.

 I would say over all our lunch experience was just was okay. Midwood Smokehouse smells great, but you leave smelling like smoked meat all day. Service was outstanding--and that is a big plus for us. The food was pretty good/okay, certainly not what I expected. I had the BBQ sandwich, it was nothing special. you can certainly find better BBQ in Charlotte -- no matter your ""style"" preference. As a side, I had the bacon wrapped jalapenos, definitely the highlight of my Midwood Smokehouse experience. My husband had the fried bologna sandwich with the smoked veggies. The smoked veggies had no taste of veggies and only tasted of smoke. He was not a fan of his sandwich, because the cheese overtook the bologna. The Midwood Smokehouse has fixed alot of the problems the former tenant had in regards to usage of space. The bar is no longer awkward and the set up is very spacious. I would go back, but will wait a while for them to come into their own. Maybe with a little time this place can be another great eatery in Plaza-Midwood. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This Fry's is better than most in terms of cleanliness and selection, and on the low end of the service scale.

 I'm torn with this review because Crudo used to be my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix til the last time we went with a group of 8. In the past, the drinks & food have all been phenomenal. Loved the crispy pig ears, all the crudo plates (since I love raw fish!), and their squid ink risotto was delish. A great space too. The last time we went though was a major fail on the food. The drinks still held up strong (thus the 3 stars), but the crispy pig ears were soggy & super oily, and the raw fish smelled & tasted horrible. How could you serve unfresh fish raw? If you know the fish ain't good, don't offer it. Or change the menu and cook the fish so I can't tell that you're serving me fish you got last week. Because of these bad dishes we were served (which was kind of embarrassing since I was the one who suggested to everyone we eat at Crudo), I don't think any of us want to go back. This was in early summer and we haven't been back since. Sorry Crudo - you seemed to have loosened up your quality control there. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Service was good, food was good, this place truly deserves to call itself NOLA.

Bread pudding for desert was also very good, in general the food at NOLA is more expensive than I would expect at home in New Orleans but I know certain items such as shrimp cost a lot more in Pittsburgh so I certainly understand. Overall NOLA On The Square is the real deal, it's a nice option for those in Pittsburgh to experience real New Orleans food or for people like me to get some home style grub while on the road..

 I like Panda Express food but over the last few years their servings have gotten too small. We used to get the Panda Feast, I say used to because we quit going there all together. They used to fill those qt. containers until they could barely get them closed, now they fill the containers a little over 3/4 full, but charg full price. This just wasn't happening with one particular server but all of them so I think maybe their managers are telling them to under fill containers. I don't know that for sure, but what I do know is that I am not particularly fond of getting ripped off so to avoid getting burned we just don't go there anymore. ",1,0,0,0,0

 In-N-Out is a classic burger stop. Mainly over on the west coast, people swear by it and often claim this is the best burger in the country. I am not one of those. And I am not a hater. I enjoy their burgers, in fact I try to stop by whenever I am in an area that has one. What's sets INO apart is its ""animal style"" aka Thousand Island Sauce. You get it on your burger, you can get it on your fries. Whatever. It ""enhances the taste"" but to me it's all gimmick. The INO patty is bland with no flavoring (ie ketchup, sauce, etc) it's awfully boring. The fries are bland as well. You all probably think I am being unreasonable, but tell me otherwise. All the people taking about juices from the burger....I feel the patties are too small to begin with you the ""juiciness"" will be limited unless you go double-double or 4x4. INO is fun, INO is crowded, INO is landmark...but it is also is over-rated. Good burgers not the best. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This is one of my favorite places for lunch in Phoenix. They make wonderful sandwiches that are not for average sandwich. They are very creative with their menu, though you can still get some classic sandwiches! The downside is they have a very small dining room inside, and they sometimes screw up phone in orders. Other than that their sandwiches are absolutely wonderful and their sides are the bomb. They have great macaroni salad, although they don't have it every day and sometimes they sell out, so get it whenever it is available! Staff is very nice and friendly and they will always ask you how everything is. I will have to say that when I showed them my order was wrong they fixed everything quickly and willingly. A tad pricey or else I would go here more often. Usually lunch with a drink is around $10-$11. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have eaten at LCB many times.. I don't like the chain restaurants for mexican food.. I must counter the other review with the positives. Their salsa is some of the best, its fresh, homemade and a little on the black peppery side.. They serve fresh bean dip (just have to ask now) and warm chips.. I have tried the combo plates, the fajitas and the spinach and cheese enchiladas. The cheese-crisp is huge with generous amount of cheese. I ask for tomatoes on top.. I like their tostadas and crispy tacos.. I try to get a Mango rum Pina Colada which goes well with Mexican food. As for the tortillas tasting store bought, thats news to me.. I think these are far better for restaurant made than most restaurants like Chevy's who makes theirs in plain sight!

 This is one of the oldest still-running restaurants in the area. It shares a name with one of the newest restaurants on Park Avenue in New York, but is completely unrelated. In fact, I'm sure the experience you'll have here is just about the opposite. It's in a location that the 70s Historical Preservation Society must be fighting to keep alive. I'd like to say it has character, but this old poorly designed strip should probably be nuked from space. However, you can't really complain too much when it's one of the few remaining old-school Mexican joints in town. It's clean, everyone is nice, and the atmosphere inside is cozy. As my mother said... if you eat here, you can pretty much plan on going home smelling like Mexican food. Whether that's a good or bad thing can be up to you. The food is just slightly above average for this type of place. Chips were okay. I put the salsa as below average. It was flavorless, but hot. The cheese crisp was good... not too oily. The guac was good. My entree was decent. It's the type of place that serves you standard old-school dishes - generally an ugly 70s plate full of grease with a sea of beans and slop and cheese and whatnot on the side. Same story as many other places. Too much to eat, and basically none of it is healthy, and basically all of it will either constipate you or clean you out. The margaritas were pretty good. I would eat and drink here again I suppose if someone else was paying. This is your mom and dad's joint. Wish it was better. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I'm still thinking about my meal from more than a week ago. My sister has been going here regularly for years and I had the treat of trying it out recently. The bar tender/server that works there is so sweet and at the bar they have house-made kettle chips that are to die for. I almost dumped a basket into my purse and with each beer, let me tell you, it was hard to keep my self control! The food is mainly Italian and amazing. We shared a bunch of apps including the fried zucchini which is ribbon thin and mouth watering and stuffed banana peppers. But best of all I got the chicken romano ... OH MY GORSH! I got three thinly cut chicken breasts that were breaded and sitting in a pool of the ... most ... amazing cheesy creamy sauce I have ever put in my mouthballs. I am still regretting not drinking the remainder of the sauce that was left after I finished the chicken.( Would go nicely with the chips in my purse, no?)

 This show is pretty cool. The bf and I stood in line at tix4tonite and paid $70 bucks per ticket which was a very good deal compared to the online prices from $106 to $167. Standing in line wasn't bad, but once you purchase them at the tix4tonite stand you have to go over to MGM and stand in line to get your seats and actual show tickets. Luckily when we went there was no line so the process didn't take long at all. I would suggest not sitting in the front b/c the show is a moving stage and elevated so sitting in the middle anywhere gets you a good view no matter what. My favorite part was the finale at the end which is very awesome. This show is gravity defying! I recommend Ka and Zumanity as the cirque du soleil shows to see.

 Been a member with 24 for at least 10 years now and have frequented many, many, many different locations. When I first moved to PHX, I was kinda down that this location was closest to my house, and not a new or renovated one (hello, Tech Center in Vancouver--well, when it first opened at least ;p). My opinion changed quickly. The staff was always nice--the gym manager always present-it was obvious who he was because he always went above and beyond to make sure everything was going well, etc. Never a long wait for the treads, elip's, or ski machines. My favorite thing about this gym was the TKB classes and the instructors. Before my 'life' at 24 hour, I had been with Golds for a good 5 years at least and been kickboxing well before Tae-Bo made it popular (live strong, Billy Blanks!). I am totally picky about instructors and their technique, energy, etc. Melanie is, by far, the best instructor ever. Though I travel relentlessly for work, I found myself negotiating my calendar to make sure I'd be back in town to make her classes. Even if my flight got me in damn-near midnight on Friday night, my butt would be up and at the gym by 9am Saturday morning---so motivating. Laura was great for the Monday morning 930am classes and Kris as well throughout the week. Now that I live in the Bay again, I have YET to find an instructor as motivating as Melanie. There was one at the Pleasanton Supersport, but they have the shottiest service, I'm about to boycott them even though they're closest to me (totally rather go to San Ramon instead). Don't give up on this location just because its not the newest or prettiest. Its busy, and not crazy busy. Goes back to 'cant judge a book by its cover'! :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 Omg this is the worst place ever. We were seated and waited 20 minutes for a server. No joke. Our server blamed the other girl and got us drinks.

I said sure. 20 minutes later we were done eating and she said ohhhh u ordered another beer. I said just bring the check. She brought the check and never returned to collect payment. My boyfriend finally got up and ask someone to cash us out. The app was never taken off however that was the least of out worries. Bummed that the sucked.

Not to mention, this place is in ghetto, looks and smells like it. Veterinarian couldn't speak good English. I didn't feel like I could get answers from him, so no point in discussing further. I'm not coming back and will stay miles away from this area! ",0,1,0,0,0

 The customer service here is a joke. Not only did the waitress gives smart ass responses so did the manager! Unbelievable the manager told my fianc \ u00e9 to ""go eat tomatoes"" since he didn't like the pancakes and was asking to get the substitute. Short, rude, and doesn't understand the basics of customer service. No need for a smart ass comment! Never coming here again, and the food wasn't all that either. Might as well go to IHOP. Least no one is going to tell my fianc \ u00e9 to eat tomatoes there. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I was very disappointed with the experience I thought it would be better considering he's so famous and he goes around to other bakeries and tells them how to bake! I love the show and was so excited about going to the bakery and then it just was a huge letdown! The cupcakes we're not that great I got a red velvet cupcake the ratio of frosting to cupcake was not good also got a carrot cake cupcake it was ok don't get me wrong they look beautiful they just don't taste as good as they look.... My daughter got a Boston cream pie it looks like something you would get at a hospital did not taste good and was really small and cost $8! The only thing I can say good about the place was the lobster tails were pretty good and the cannolis were okay... The prices were way too expensive. You would think considering he is at the Venetian hotel that there would be a shop to actually do shopping in but there's not the bakery is tiny and there's nowhere to actually get souvenirs, and because the bakery is so small you feel rushed, not only that you can't even tell where the line starts and were the bakery actually is in the hotel! I seriously would not waste my time with this shop not worth it! Customer service isn't that great huge lack of communication! I have been a huge fan of buddies from the start but now I don't know what to think! I'm really grateful that I didn't waste the money to have the cannolis shipped to my house totally not worth it! If you're in Vegas and the line is huge honestly I wouldn't even waste the time its not worth it! Just disappointed! I seriously feel like even if I was in New Jersey on vacation I would not even stop at his shop now because of this.... I hope that maybe in a few more months his bakery will get better maybe it's just because it just opened who knows not even sure if I'll ever give it another shot though but we'll see.... ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is my go-to place for repair and maintenance. I am always satisfied with the results. The process, however, could be improved. I would be a LOT less annoyed if they gave themselves a 30 minute buffer (or realistic timeline) on how long a service would take. They tell you how long the service would take, but not take into account the queue ahead of your vehicle, amount of staff or supplies in stock. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We went to Top Shelf because we had a coupon from our Entertainment book for a buy one, get one free entree. When we got to the restaurant, we hung out in the waiting area for a few minutes before the hostess came to seat us, but we enjoyed looking at the fish tank while we waited. Our waitress was nice and kept our drinks filled and the food was pretty good, but maybe a little pricey for the portions. When the bill came, we gave the waitress our coupon. She brought back the bill and our kid's meal was the one given to us free. When we asked, she said she tried to give us the second adult entree as the free meal, but the manager wouldn't let her. She then had the manager come talk to us, but he wouldn't budge on the matter. I have never been to a restaurant that considers a kid's meal to be an entree. It seems this company is more concerned with making a couple bucks than good service that brings back return customers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 So we were in Phoenix last week with our 14s vball club and they decided they wanted to eat SmashBurger. I know they have one here in SD, but it never really grabbed my attention much. I was really excited to eat there. We arrived with about 15+ people and the service was great. The guy ""KIRBY"" at the cash register was quick and new pretty much all the answers to the questions everyone asked. I had the BUILD YOUR OWN... Chicken burger. I made a mistake of getting 2 sauces on one burger but that is not why they only got 3 stars. I gave them 3 stars because I guess I expected more. I didn't get a burger but when I seen the burgers that were being served I'm glad I got my chicken. The patties were really skinny (not plump and juicy) ... maybe thats why they are called smash burger, because the burger literally looked like it was smashed to its thinnest life span. But I would go back and try their burgers, but it was just OK for me.... If the second time around I go and its just ""OK""... I probably would just stick to IN & OUT or Burger Lounge! :) Happy smashing... ",0,0,1,0,0

 For my 30th birthday we stayed at the Bellagio. This was the first Vegas trip where we didn't have to jump to hotel to hotel. We made reservations and were seated promptly. I was impressed how down to earth the server and hostesses were. I enjoyed the 90s music they played which I felt was appropriate for my dirty 30. ;) The portions of food were small, but we kind of expected that. The food was tasty and I enjoyed my birthday donuts with the dipping sauce. I hope to return here again soon. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have been to Gallo Blanco a few times now and have always been please with both the food and the service. Some of my favorites included the Elote Callejero wich is grilled corn covered in cotija cheese and then heavily sprinkled with smoked paprika. $2 tacos (they're small and delicious). I've tried them all but I must say the Cochinitas (pork marinated with achiote, orange, garlic and guajillo) were the best. I also had a white sangria (I usually prefer red but this was light and refreshing) it had lemons, grapes, mangoes, oranges, apples - delicious! They don't make it too sweet with is a big win every time. For breakfast I tried the Huevos Rancheros and was very pleased with the spicy tomato sauce that came with it. I also ordered the Fruta con crema fresca (mixed fruit w/ whipped Crema Fresca) very fresh and nice variety of fruit. The menu is pretty limited, but what they do - they do well. The prices are excellent and the dining area open and airy. I can see myself frequenting this place a lot this summer. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I definitely recommend this place for lunch not dinner. Dinner can be very pricey, and the selection at dinner isn't exactly awe inspiring. For lunch you reap the same benefits as dinner, such as being able to go to the top of the Stratosphere without having to pay extra. To sum it up the lunch menu offers the dinner entrees worth getting at a fraction of the price. Lunch ranges ~$12-$17 for sandwiches, and the pre fixe menu for ~$30. Definitely worth a try. If you have your heart set on a view of the strip at night, restaurant.com offers a dinner only coupon(p.s. sign up for the email and buy when on sale.) ",0,0,1,0,0

 This was a great evening! I met a lot of new faces. ( Or at least new to me) Bingo was so funny. I can't believe I do not know the Australian Nursery Rhyme or the laugh of a Kookaburra. Bad teacher here! At least I knew what Marsupials were. (Ha,ha redeemed) I loved all the new bar food apps. We were the first ones to check them out. Woot! I am definitely going to be telling all my peeps about the 4 dollar new bar app plates. We also got two free drink coins. I had two Margaritas. Since I was the DD, Chris was great to make them light alcohol. In fact, Chris was the best bartender eva. All the servers and staff were ever so nice tonight and extremely helpful. I felt spoiled. My favorite new app was the Coconut shrimp. Of course the old favorite Blooming Onion is still as delish as ever. I was so happy for Linda too winning that huge Knife/Culinary basket.

 This place is amazing! The other reviewers will tell you all of the wonderful things about this place so I'll leave the real reviewing to the word smiths and foodies. Here is what I have to say: Ron Swanson would cry at the glory of this steakhouse! Drink the Kentucky Peachtree, an amazing cocktail that has a bourbon foundation with a light ginger beer finish; strong enough for man but gentle enough for a lady. Eat: the bacon. I don't think I need to say why but you should probably bring a change of underwear. Also eat the steak, this goes without saying but you'll hate yourself if you eat chicken or fish here...I'm sure its lovely but why? Honestly everything I ate here was wonderful I do think that the desert menu lacks in comparison with the rest of the menu - the Carmel Turtle is the star of the desert menu. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place gets busy with tourists, so prepare to wait in line, and fight for your place because some people don't get the line formation for the cashiers (one main line for each section of registers). You can get pretty much anything here, even hard liquor. Prices aren't that steep, either. My only gripe is that the maximum cash back amount you get when paying with a debit card is $20. I hate paying extra fees when withdrawing from a hotel ATM, so I usually go to a CVS to get cash back. I guess you could go through the line a bunch of times to get more cash, but it's certainly a bitch when they're busy. ",0,0,1,0,0

 If you are in this area and looking for a place to grab some lunch this is a good place to go. This is purely and simply a place where you can get a good lunch that will fill you up without much expense on your part. Go elsewhere and you'll get a small pie and a cookie and you'll have spent all your money without actually making any impact on your hunger. Most of the takeaways or cafes in this immediate area don't offer good value for money, but this place is the exception.

 I've been coming here for the past 10 years and have always enjoyed the food and the atmosphere, so I'm sad to have to write a review that speaks poorly about the place. Having said that, my last experience at Tessaro's was ruined before we were even seated. While waiting with my girlfriend to be seated for 25 minutes, a party of 3 walks in and is immediately seated. When I ask why a party of 3 would be seated before the many parties of 2 waiting I was told that the seating was laid out specifically to accommodate a specific number of people: absurd! We proceed to wait another 15 minutes until a 2 top opened up. I would gladly recommend this place on the food, but given how inefficient the seating system is I'd only go when you can be seated right away. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I went here twice in the past 2 months, and I will not return. During the first trip I bought quite a lot of merchandise, and was impressed with the size of the store and the variety of products. I thought, ""Great, maybe I can come here instead of driving all the way to Michael's"". Except that when I went to return an item, I walked out knowing I will ALWAYS drive all the way to Michael's. Behind the customer service counter (and I use the term customer service lightly here), a sign tells you all the ways they make returns easy. I'm just not sure any of the employees here have read that sign. I felt like a criminal. I was told I was being done a huge favor by taking my item back, even though I had the receipt, because I didn't have the packaging that went with it. Who keeps the packaging from an item they're trying out in their house?? Besides that, I never received a smile, eye contact, ""hello"", or any sort of normal human response that would let me know they cared if I was alive or dead. And that was with contact from a regular employee and a manager. Thanks but no thanks. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I recently seen an add about Ernie's being a Maryland style seafood house, and being from Maryland I had to test it out. I ordered the Crab Cake Platter, which included 1 large crab cake, about 7 or 8 steamed shrimp (seasoned with Old Bay!) and a cup of MD style crab soup. Man, did I feel like home. The Maryland style crab soup was very tastey and had shreaded crab meat throughout, very thick and full of flavor. I'd give it a 8 out of ten, more backfin meat and it would have been a 10. The crab cake was large and no filler was in sight. It was seasoned just right and was one of the best I've had outside Baltimore. It was crispy on the outside and hunks of backfin on the inside. They do a very good job. The shrimp were a little over cooked and covered with a weird sauted Old Bay onion mix. At first I was not sure about the combination but it worked. Overall, I was very impressed with the Maryland style food. The only thing that need to be fixed is the strange paintings on the walls. The room has a sports / crabhouse feel but the animal paintings on the walls just doesn't go. ",0,0,0,1,0

 1 star because there is no opportunity to give zero. I called 2 times and both times I was told that I would get a call back shortly. That did not happen. I was trying to set up a going away party for my manager but they never responded to accommodate us. On the first call I was told that I would receive a call back shortly with confirmation, that was at noon. 4 hours later I had not heard back so I called again. The hostess insisted that she was not trying to ignore me but that she was waiting for a manager to approve our party. It is now 11pm, still no call. I called back for the third time and yet again I am told there is no manager. The guy on the phone ended the call by saying ""either I can take a message or I can't help you"". For a new bar trying to receive the respect of the local community it just lost 30+ potential customers who had no idea it even existed and sadly work across the street. So much for supporting local.

 New place in Hard Rock, I thought I would check it out. I ordered a panini, and was given a cold sandwich. I then informed the clerk that a panini is supposed to be warm..and pressed.

 The menu here is really unique... This is not an IHOP! The first time I went was for breakfast and I had the corned beef hash. It was pretty really good because it was ""real"" corned beef hash. (You will see what I mean.) There was so much of it that I had to take it home. It was a complete meal though because it also included eggs and fruit. I did not like the lemonade they served. It tasted gross, but oddly, I think it was supposed to taste that way... My most recent visit was for dinner. I had the sage chicken with the penne pasta. I did not like the pasta, but the chicken was pretty good. My boyfriend got the sage fried chicken and waffles. He thought it was amazing and so did I! As far as food presentation goes, they do that very well. The food (during breakfast) is served on these large, heavy skillets. Dinner is served on large (and I mean large) plates. I adore Hash House. They not only make food good, they make it fun. I love this ""twisted"" farm food. ",0,0,0,0,1

 To be honest, this review is just as much about the adjoining section of blackjack tables as it is about the baritself. And to be a little more honest, this review is just as much of an opportunity to talk about the bar and tables as it is to mention that some of the ""BOND Girls"" are really, really hot! Although BOND's size may be modest (there are some seats circling the bar, but not much in the way of tables), the d \ u00e9cor isn't - chic and trendy, which is what you'd expect of a Cosmopolitan bar. At the same time, the vibe is pretty relaxed and I thought the drinks were well made. Prices might be a little high, but they seem in line with other bars on The Strip. Bonus points too for having a live DJ at night, even though there isn't really a defined dance floor (my friends made do). As far as the tables go, they're among my favorites on the Strip. I've had better luck elsewhere, but it's hard to beat single deck blackjack with $10 limits. Especially when it's manned (womanned?) by some pretty attractive dealers; it (almost) makes losing money easier to take! And if that's still not enough, the close proximity to the bar means servers will come by that much more often to help drown any sorrows away. Whether you're here for the gambling, drinking, or merely waiting for your table at The Henry across the way, BOND is a pretty chill spot to chat and people watch with friends. Just ask the group of douchey frat guys who were standing off to the side for over half an hour, mesmerized by the synchronized dancers performing on the platforms. Talk about creepy... ",0,0,0,1,0

 If I could give this place zero stars I would. The place is small and over crowded.

 So, this is your standard grocery store, with a phenomenal bakery, decent prices, and a particularly convenient location in the Complexe Desjardins, just down from the Hyatt Regency. My problem with this location is its incredibly limited hours of operation. It seems to close obscenely early (8:00 p.m. on weekdays), even on weekends (9:00 p.m.), which is incredibly frustrating, particularly when one is in town on business and just needs to pick up a few things. I couldn't find the hours posted on the store door like they are in the US, and there were no hours posted on Yelp (I've just confirmed the hours on IGA.net and posted them here). If this place had longer hours, I would easily rate it four stars. At the aforementioned bakery, the cr \ u00eapes are pretty fantastic. You can order them fresh or in a to-go cup, with custard and cream, and they are still fresh and delicious. I also tried some caramel-chocolate pastry confection that was pretty extraordinary. They have a decent produce selection, although I did see several overripe avocados and bananas (completely with fruit flies). A minor complaint, since this seems to happen everywhere. I was not impressed with their microbrew beer selection, particularly since on my last visit to Montr \ u00e9al, I distinctly recall waltzing into gas stations and delis and coming out with Unibroue bombers but, alas, there were no Unibroue beers here! There was plenty of Le Cheval Blanc beers, of which I sampled Loch Ness, Coup de Grisou, Rousse, among a few others, and did not particularly care for any of them. (What's a girl gotta do to get an IPA up in here??) All told, yes, super convenient location, and a very clean store with lots of selections and reasonable prices, but incredibly inconvenient hours, and sub-par beer choices. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This review is strictly for reBAR, because I did not eat at Bliss. I very rarely give out one star ratings, but I very rarely get terrible service. I came in on a busy Friday night with two other people, and I went to the inside bar to get a drink while they went to the bathroom. As a side note - the bathroom is in a really weird location, so the line extends out to where people are sitting at tables. I stood at the front of the bar and ended up waiting for service for 10-15 minutes, which is completely understandable, except for the fact that I was watching everyone get served except me. I was beginning to think that it was me, since I was watching people left and right get cycled out at the bar. I finally got the courage to raise my hand and ask for three beers. The bartender, very rudely, snapped at me saying, ""you will wait your turn"" I understand that the bar was busy, but even the guy next to me commented on how long I had been standing there. After that, I left and went to the bar outside. The bartender promptly served me immediately upon arriving and even bought one of my beers to make up for the bad service. I never send food back, I'm a good tipper, and I'm friendly to servers. I am NEVER a rude customer, so I was extremely disgusted with my treatment. I will never be back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I've been here 3 times in the past 4 days. Why have I not visited earlier? C&S is adorable and cosy and charming, offering sweet sophistication to those of us on the westside. I've sampled a lemon tart, red velvet cake, chocolate biscotti, lemon-scented vanilla cake, apple pie, raspberry pie, banana cream tart, and blueberry scone. (N.B. My exercise level has increased dramatically this past week!) All were fantastic and fresh and fruity and yummy. The icings on the cake aren't too sweet and the pastry is flaky and light. My turkey sandwich last night was savoury and sweet at the same time! That apricot jam complements the turkey and cheese nicely. If you don't want pastries or ""real food,"" there is always the gelato case with 8 different flavours of dairy decadence or the chocolate/bonbon case with its array of temptations.

 madison mini marathon 2012!!! oh man... i was so stinking sick for this half marathon. i probably should not have run. at all. however, i will not take a ""DNF"" for anything. stubborn? maybe. my friends and family think its mental illness. no one should love running THAT much. well. i do. the madison mini is a nice event. the packet pick up is located in the uw madison union south. it was not super easy to park at for out of towners. in fact, i got a little turned around. could have been the medication i was on. could have just been the fact i didn't know where i was. either way, i eventually found it, and it was no problem to get my race packet once i was there. race day parking was spread out at a variety of area parking garages. not being totally familiar with downtown madison, i just picked a parking garage based on nothing but the fact that i liked name. the start line is located near the uw memorial union. it was kind of a hike from the parking garage i picked. (perhaps i'll employ a better method next time) there were plenty of port-a-johns at the start. that will always win points from the ladies. however, there were a lot of mascots (you know, with the big heads. like people in suits).... and frankly, i'm creeped out by that. maybe it was the medication i was on. i was unsettled. in a donnie darko kind of way. i took the start line. tried to convince myself i was going to rock this. some guy on the loud speaker was yelling. i felt sorry for everyone who was sleeping in the apartments on the street we were lined up on. and we were off. i felt good for the first 7 miles. honestly, i kind of forgot i had a pretty serious illness. mile 8.... i was trying to decide what the runner etiquette might be - barf on the side of the road, barf in the port-a-john? (i went with the port-a-john and it was way worse for me. face down in a port-a-john is good for no one.) the course is really pretty nice. a bit hilly, but it's madison. madison is hilly just driving through it, so you expect that. you run through the farmer's market and to the capital in the beginning, which i think was my favorite part. you run around the lakes as well. i did not so much like this part. the crowd began to thin and you ended up in the middle of nowhere. i didn't expect this in a city run. i thought i would be running through the city, not through the wilderness. it came as kind of an unwelcome surprise. the end of the race was nice though. it finished along the lake on campus. i was full on sprinting just to get it down with. i think i probably set a mile time PR, feeling my absolute worst just to get done. the race village was nice at the finish line and i feel bad i didn't enjoy it more. there was a live band and lots of beer. if you ran both the madison mini and the summerfest rock and sole half in milwaukee, you got an additional medal and they totaled your time for a the M2M challenge stats. i would give this race another chance when i don't feel so terrible. being prepared to run through a less urban setting would better prepare me for this race. also, not being sick would probably be an amazing bonus. i don't hold it against you, madison. you're still about the most awesome city in the midwest next to my sweet home chicago.

 This place isn't for the poor...as in people with poor taste buds because this place is delicious! Seated within The Mirage on the Strip, Kokomo's is definitely an impressive, fine-dining experience. Here's a link to the menu: http://www.mirage.com/restaurants/kokomos.aspx The ambiance was very dark and quiet with music playing gently in the background. The waiter was extremely attentive without being annoying. The cranberry and bacon bread was amazing! I don't even like bread but this was something exquisite. My date ordered the Lobster Bisque Soup with a Puff Pastry Dome. It was definitely a larger portion than she anticipated but it certainly was amazing. I had a caesar salad with an egg-less dressing and crisp parmesan cheese ( I held the anchovies). We both ordered the 8 oz fillet, oscar topped. Definitely the best steak I've had in long time. Not the best I've had but what's wrong with a close second. We also had Washington apple martinis as that was the drink on special. I can't remember how it's made but it certainly was unique and tasty. This place is a little pricey. Just two of us came to a little over $200 for what I described above but you're in Vegas, everything is a little pricey. I wouldn't pay that much for USDA prime anywhere else. For that price you can get certified Angus beef or even Kobe. Overall, this is a great dining experience if you're looking for something more classy and quiet to take your date too while your in Vegas. I'm sad to say that I just heard that Kokomo's will be closing effective January 13th, 2013. I guess I'll have to find a new fine dining experience when I go back. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Spam! They have Spam! Yeah that compressed, salty, meat from a can. Ok, ok...I realized I may be the only one excited about this, ESPECIALLY since they are known for their FABULOUS rotating beer selection, 30+ on tap at any one time. They also offer some wines on tap as well. Order up a flight or 2 (6 tasters of your choosing of any of the listed beers) and expand your beer palate or go for a pint of your favorite. Their menu is quite complementary to their beer offerings. Ok, now back to the Spam. Now trust me on this, when Spam is done right it can be quite tasty. They do it very well here. Their Spam Sliders, as a meal if you enjoy Spam as much as I do, or nicely shared. It is fried to crisp perfection and served on toasted Hawaiian bread with a Sriracha mayo coleslaw. My other Spammy favorite is a Sammy, the Churchill Grilled Cheese, you pay a lil extra for the crispy fried Spam goodness (or bacon, you really can't go wrong here) but it goes so well with the melty deliciousness of smoked mozzarella and fontina cheese. You have to come and check out their Tuesday TV dinner meal. A TV dinner like compartment tray comes to you filled with yummies that vary every week (Main dish, side or 2, and a dessert). These are not Hungry Man meals but you won't leave hungry. Make sure to follow them on Facebook to see what they are serving up that Tuesday and get there early because it has been know to be a sell out option. I love this place, but, ""Why only 4 stars?"", you ask. Well, it gets quite loud in the main restaurant area. Every sound kind of carries and you spend your time speaking loudly to have a conversation. So when the weather is good I like the patio mostly because the noise issue does not carry-over to the patio. Always, check their Facebook for fun and educational events and ""classes"". I recently attended a ""Cider School"" here on a weekend before they opened for business that day. In attendance were Woodchuck and J.K. Scrumpy brewers/reps. We tasted 6 types of apples commonly used in cider making. Tasted several ciders, including some that were not even on the market yet. Oh don't let me forget the food pairing. The most fun I have had in a long time. [That event itself was a 10 out of 5 stars, LOVED IT] ",0,0,0,1,0

 I booked the room over the holiday weekend based upon the pictures posted and the location. The front desk staff were friendly and efficient, but the hotel was clearly not the same as what was posted. The room was clean but had a strong musty odor . The walls must have been paper thin as you could hear neighboring rooms conversations very clearly. This made sleep a challenge. Breakfast was good, with scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon and ham . Free wifi did not work most of the time , and was the slowest that I have ever encountered. Hotel overall has basic accommodations, but should not be confused with a resort which they appear to bill themselves as. ",0,1,0,0,0

 BEST DAMN BURGERS on the strip!! After our convention ended for the day, my boss and I wanted to get something to eat after all the activities. The location of the Burger Bar is between Luxor and Mandalay Bay at the Mandalay Place Mall. I wasn't sure what to expect, but sure was great my boss wanted to go here. I was supposed to go here last November, but my plans had switched because of the Pacquiao fight. We were greeted by a beautiful lady and placed on the tables near the entrance because the booths were full. My boss wanted to see the Football game, but at the same time have a great meal with our work money. I opened up the menu and I see this expensive $60 burger. Foie Gras Burger...What?! Geez. I ordered the American Classic with skinny fries ($14). I am not sure what my boss ordered since it was a customized burger, but sure was delicious for both of us. I guess I am willing to pay $14 for a burger, but not a dime more. The atmosphere was awesome and people were just having fun watching the game either with the MLB or NFL. The American Classic Burger is a MUST!!! One day...I will order the Foie Gras Burger...just need to win $60 bucks..... Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 3 stars as a restaurant 4 as a bar. BTW:I apologize for my lackluster previous review. When I first discovered yelp I went for quantity, not quality. So this place used to be Jack Straw's which was probably THE best music venue the the town has ever ""scene"". Well its not that place anymore. Its still worth visiting and has more than just a bar or restaurant vibe to it. On nice sunny days the deck is beautiful. We had a going away party for a friend today. We made reservations for 30 for Sunday brunch. Only place in town with a mimosa deal that would take a crowd like us. You would think that they would maybe tell a couple of extra servers to come in at least for the hour or 2 we were there. We had 2 servers for our group and they also had other tables. They did well, but felt I pretty bad for the other tables. The brunch menu was large, but mostly it was just slight variations on eggs and meat with some major exceptions. It was a cheaply made paper menu, but the one thing that stood out ""the hangover"" which was a breakfast sandwich on a doughnut. But, they don't serve it anymore, even though it was on this cheaply made menu. I tasted many peoples dishes, they were good but over priced. Everything was roughly $9 except for biscuits and gravy and french toast. Although, the $2 mimosa's and $4 bloody mary's is hard to beat. All in all, this place has a history that it doesn't live up to. Its good, but plenty of other places to go. Side notes:Parking lot sucks, but its made up by the fact that they have SKEEBALL!!!!!!!!!! ",0,0,1,0,0

 My boyfriend and I decided to try here since we were looking for a new place to eat on Friday night. When we showed up we were asked to wait, even though the restaurant was half empty, but we assumed maybe some wait staff had called out. when we were seated and we ordered, they brought out the bread. It was nice and warm, but one of the loaves was on the edge of being burnt and they both had sesame seeds on top that reminded me of those bread sticks that you get in cellophane wrappers. We had both ordered the house dressing for our salads, but it turned out to be oil and vinegar, which would have been fine except one salad had all the oil, which was bitter, and one had all the vinegar. Also, the salad was half a handful of romaine, 2 onion rings, 2 small black olives, and a tomato slice. Then our dinner showed up. I had gotten the Manicotti and my boyfriend had gotten the Cannelloni. The red sauce on top tasted like it was tomato paste from a can that was watered down and the sauce on mine tasted like someone had added extra sugar. I could honestly taste the aluminum in the sauce. The noodles were soggy, and my boyfriend said that his tasted reheated. I did discover someone had put slivers of garlic under the melted cheese on top, because they weren't fully cooked. As for the service, our waiter would ask questions and then leave without hearing the answer and they brought us small pitchers so we could refill our drinks, then forgot to bring more when those pitchers ran out.

 Visited Montreal w friends and checked out this restaurant (recommended by the hotel concierge). We LOVED it. We did the tapas special ($55/person for variety of tapas, including dessert) and it was absolutely delicious! Great food and wine. The octopus could be better... the chorizo was a bit spicy to eat alone... but everything else was delicious, ESPECIALLY the mussels. YUM! I'd give it 5 stars, but the interior decor needs a little more work to get the full 5 stars... and the service needs to be a bit better, but I suppose it may be the snobbish waiters that make the place a bit more desirable to some.

 I really wanted to like the Improv more than I did. When I found out one of my BF's favorite comedians, Patton Oswalt, was coming, I bought tickets about three months in advance. I used the Improv web site, and would like to note that it was relatively painless and easy to navigate (though could use a design update and less ""clutter""). So, we show up early to pick up our tickets and stake a good spot in line to get a decent table (first come first seated, it said on the web site) Here's where I get really annoyed - there's a guy at the bottom of the stairs that take you up to the venue who gives you your tickets, which have already got a number on them - our table number he says. I don't know how many different ways I asked him why there was a line of people out front and why we didn't have to wait in it if we did as he instructed, but I never got a clear answer. So, we head up the stairs and past about 35 people in line and head in a door, to a small mini ""club"" with a guy standing at a rolling cart of booze. The bartender informs us that we can hang out in here instead of wait in line outside if we buy at least one drink. Furthermore, we will be seated first (though why that makes a difference since our envelop with our tickets had a table number on it, I don't know...it was all very confusing - esp. because the web site says first come, first seated) But it's cold and we don't want to wait in line outside so we abide and grab the last table in the mini lounge which is playing old reruns of In Living Color. They start filing us into the main venue and the layout is just ok. I would almost argue that there isn't a ""good"" seat in the house. All the tables faced the exact wrong way, so no matter where you sat, you had to swivel away (it's too tight to actually turn you chair) from where your drink and table is. Some tables were just downright ridiculous, shoved all the way in a corner, practically behind the stage. At least the drinks were reasonable - well, $5 for a bottle of Bug Light. But you could drink for cheap if you wanted to. I will say that the service was GREAT. The waiters were really cool, really fast and really efficient given they're mostly working in the dark and whispering. The ""warm up"" guy was actually pretty funny, and the opening guy was even better. No hecklers or issues to speak of. After the show, they open these back doors that go right out to the parking lot for an easy escape...except after four beers I really had to go to the bathroom. Big fat BOO to the girls' bathroom having two stalls! It's like after a movie. I seriously considered peeing in the parking lot, but I stuck it out. So all in all, it wasn't *bad* but it wasn't amazing. The d \ u00e9cor and tables and chairs were really cheap. I guess I expected more of an experience from a renowned comedy club. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The location: As stated numerous times, it's a bit cramped. I'd recommend the owners look at Pineville or Matthews for a larger space for the same money, when the lease is up. The food: The food is OK. My wife like's the brisket, but there is a little more fat in that than I care for. The pulled pork was excellent, however. Good selection of sides, and there was plenty to eat. If you like soft serve ice cream, the provide that desert, free of charge, which is a nice touch. Overall, not bad from a restaurant chain. The prices: As you would expect in this area, you pay a little more, for a little less. That's the Ballantyne way. The service: My wife and I have only been there twice, but my son is a regular with his workplace around the corner. In comparing notes, it appears that we have came to the exact same conclusion. When the female owner / manager is present, the staff is up to par, execution is good and service is quick and friendly. When she's not, like this past Sunday, it falls apart. Not friendly, not appreciative for our business. You could say rude would be the better word. Yes, I realize it's near the holidays, but I want to be treated like my $40 order mattered, OK? BTW, I was the only patron in the restaurant at the time, so it's not as if they were busy. I was just interrupting their day. Bottom line: I'll give them one, more shot, at getting it right, otherwise I can get better barbecue much closer to my home from Rock Store BBQ. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It had been awhile since I'd been to a Lone Star and I really had no memories of the experience, so a few friends and I decided to try it out as it was the nearest steakhouse to our location. We were extremely disappointed. Although the service was just fine and the bread & cheese fries were tasty, the rest of the food was either wholly unremarkable or completely unsatisfactory. I ordered the 8 oz. sirloin (so cold and purple throughout that it could walk off the plate on its own; I know, go ahead and make a face...), with saut \ u00e9ed mushrooms and a house salad (no onions, extra ranch dressing) as my sides. The salad was very plain and had nothing about it to distinguish it from any other salad anywhere (including one you would make at home or one that you would get from any buffet salad bar anywhere in the nation). I did not expect the salad to be the highlight of the meal, but usually there is something (a spiced up ranch dressing, flavored croutons, etc) that add to uniqueness of a 'house' salad. Not this time. Meh. When my entr \ u00e9e showed up, the steak was warm, light pink throughout, rubbery, and absolutely flavorless. No rub, no marinade, and the cut had clearly either been recently frozen or sitting in a fridge for an extended period of time because the flavor of oxidation was rife. Please note that I never expect there to be marinades or rubs on a steak, but then I do expect the cut to stand up on its own (which it did not in this case). The saut \ u00e9ed mushrooms were particularly disappointing. I love saut \ u00e9ed mushrooms. Adore them. I require nothing more than a little butter or oil on them and then just go to town in that pan! The mushrooms I received were a mix of mushrooms that had been saut \ u00e9ed to the point of shriveled brown lumps and those that had been held over a warm microwave for 15 seconds. On top of this odd culinary spectrum, there seemed to be nothing but water on them, which didn't do anything to assist in the flavor. A quarter through the meal, I'd had enough and claimed a full tummy (a white lie... forgive me). Although the server was kind and competent, the food was a severe let down and I would never return to this or any other location. Sorry, Lone Star. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My husband's new obsession is saltwater tanks and I have been dragged to just about every store in the valley. This is by far the best store dedicated to the supplies needed for reef maintenance. They also have a small section for freshwater. They have premixed salt water (bring your jugs, they will fill them), a wide variety of fish, and some shrimp, snails, eels, urchins, and crabs. They have the best selection of live rock and both soft and hard corals I have seen and they all seem to be responsibly harvested. The store is bright and impeccably clean and the tanks are well maintained. The staff is very professional and knowledgeable. If you're going to get involved in an expensive hobby like this, you may as well buy from the best. Aqua Touch's hours: Monday-Saturday 11-7 Sunday 12-5 ",0,0,0,0,1

 I use YELP all the time and find the information beneficial however while visiting my 80 year old aunt in Las Vegas she asked that I take her to a salon to cut her hair. My was a bit long so I decided to find a place in YELP and we could both get our hair cut. I called and made an appointment for the both of us so we could make her other appointments. When we arrived I knew that the place wouldn't be in the best location after I had read the reviews. The two owners there were in the middle of working on other clients. 1pm came and went and 15 minutes later my aunt asked if it would be much longer since she had another appointment. The two guys who I can only assume are Ric and Noel became angry and said they couldn't exactly say how long they would be and we wouldn't expect to get in right away to a doctors office. These two guys started becoming very irate, yelling at my aunt and myself about time and their behavior became unacceptable, snarky to the point of scaring my aunt. They said they could reschedule and I explained that I lived out of town and would be leaving and this was the only time I was available. They then told us to leave. Ric or Noel stated that he couldn't work under pressure and wouldn't be able to cut our hair. This behavior is UNACCEPTABLE, UNPROFESSIONAL and I would never recommend a place that yells at a 80 year old woman EVER. DO NOT GO HERE. These guys should not run a business or be around the public until they learn to control their outbursts. I would say they probably wrote the below recommendations to get people into the salon.

Twenty minutes later another manager Came and was curt and rude and refused to honor the commitment of 1st manager/waitress. The managers treatment was unacceptable.

 I don't typically write reviews on airports, but I have to write a few lines on YUL. This airport is so un-necessarily large, confusing, broken and un-functional that it makes JFK look organized. The walkways are broken and when your plane arrives at gate 88 like mine did, and you have to walk to gate 1 after traveling all day...what do you want to do? Strangle someone...ugh. The escalators don't work - now...most fat Americans SHOULD take the stairs but carrying luggage up a flight of stairs, 4 of them, isn't ideal. The construction outside of the airport is WORSE than JFK...you have no f'ing clue where you're going... the signs aren't up and entrance ramps/off-ramps just seem to end and take you back on the road you were just on. Fun if you were a 4 year old kid...for me? not quite. AND to top it all off? When the jetway can't reach your standard Canadair Regional Jet POS Jet Plane because the operator doesn't know how to operate it requiring you to take a RAMP to get off the plane and on to the jetway..........I can't even finish the sentence.

 Aligned with what other yelpers have said the service was below par... The waitress sent out crappy vibes to us the entire night. Our meal started off with her spilling water on one of our friends. Mistakes happen, but what really pist me off was she didn't say sorry right away. Her face had no remorse about the situation and she went to get towels to clean up. Bah. Then later she forgot to get our tables napkins and when she gave us waters she clanked the glass on the table real loud with attitude. Talk about a Debbie Downer. I do not know what this chick's problem was but if I'm going to pay $20 for a burger I expect more. I will say that the manager handled the situation well after my friend spoke to him. He took off his burger and milkshake off our tab. Wowee! The black pepper was so bomb and the meat was perfectly cooked. I love how the pepper gave the burger a kick to it. I also love that the bun was toasted and not soggy. The bun was also really fluffy in consistency. The shoestring fries were perfect. I stole some sips of milkshakes from my friends and the ""Birthday cake"" was amazing. I would recommend sharing these milkshakes with a friend or you may get diabetes on the spot.

 I have tried this place several times since it is within walking distance of my house. I even tried ordering different food, or going at different times, but the result was always the same: mediocre or bad food and mediocre atmosphere. I'm not sure why they have a jukebox, since I went there to watch sports. All I ever heard was music, no audio to the games or fights. The burgers are OK, salads are OK sometimes but usually gross. Philly Chicken so dry you can barely swallow it. I ordered a turkey wrap and the menu listed ""lettuce"" but what I really got was some lettuce medley with carrots and cabbage and other garbage. Like a bag of expired salad from WalMart. The time before that (May 2013), the server was nice but acted shady. Later I saw my credit card was hit 3x for the same meal. When I went in to resolve the issue, Andi was very nice and gave me 2 free beers while I waited to find out what happened. The first 2 charges didn't go though since they had been cancelled but the funds were still held until everything was resolved. Pretty annoying. I would have given the place one star, but management was nice and apologetic and they did resolve the credit card thing. (Strange how Andi mentioned they have had issues with that server before, but he still works there.) Needless to say, I won't be back. Unless it is for happy hour, which the prices are pretty decent. But I definitely won't plan to eat, and I'll pay cash. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Wow lets talk about poor service. So the reviews looked pretty positive so a friend and I went here on vDay (today) we called to put our name on the list for 8, got there at 7.30, got seated at 9.20, only because we saw the girl who first wrote down our name. It kind of got to be a game, each person would ask where they were on the list and all the girl would say is 'yah, just a few' or 'just a little bit' without even finding their names. Not a place that is used to packed crowds. Now lets talk about the veggie burrito I got which was just filled with zucchini, 3 small pieces of onion and two slivers of carrots.

 This place is a one heck of a gem located in an off-the-street building in the central Phoenix area. Luckily it is just down the street from my parents' home and gave me a good way to find something else to do while I was dealing with their belongings after my father passed on. The pros: 1. A nice space with tons of the things you loved (or still love) as a kid. You want some obscure items, then you might find them in the building. I saw quite a few things I would have normally purchased had I lived in the area. Unfortunately I didn't want to deal with packing or shipping those items. There were some definite deals that could be made if you did the research before buying. 2. A great overall selection of toys, games, figurines, and comic books. They buy, sell, and I think trade items so the ability to haggle is a plus. It took quite a while to look at most of the items in the place. It's pretty much a small group of dealers who get together to sell what they have without having to have a retail store. 3. Easy to find off of the road. Plenty of parking. One day there was a ton of people there so it was a little chaotic. The cons: 1. It's pretty much a consortium of small dealers so it can be a little confusing. As for customer service, you pretty much have to go out of your way to get a dealer's attention. You will have to take the time to see everything and when you decide to buy make sure you research the prices. I saw a couple of items that were definitely over-priced but some items that went the opposite direction. 2. If lots of people are inside, then it's crowded so be mindful of your surroundings so you don't knock anything over. I think a move might be in the future based upon the increased popularity of the this space. Overall I really dig this place. I let me do a lot of window shopping and helped to give me an idea of what I might get the next time I visit Phoenix. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ugh. If you have the opportunity to visit Fruition in person, fine, great. Maybe their brick-and-mortar experience far outweighs their online experience. I live in San Francisco, so I only have the online experience to go off of. Verdict: Won't be shopping with these folks again. Thinking about the hassle I went through just to complete one (my first and last) transaction with them makes me not want to write this review. But I will. Because the masses need to know. The long and short of it is this: It took Fruition a month to get my order to me. They want to lay blame with USPS, and that's fine. To an extent. Sometimes, things happen out of your control. I get that. But you make a concerted effort to fix the situation, not a half-assed one. I've worked in the customer service industry before, so I know how important it is to avoid disgruntled patrons. And yeah, kowtowing to one person might *feel* like the most inane, spineless thing to do, but you do it because you're in a business that relies on repeat customers and good word-of-mouth. So how you, as a proprietor or store manager, feel about doing something doesn't negate what you *should* do about something. That said, the moment Nate knew something was afoot with my package and the USPS, should've been when he became proactive in resolving the matter. He should've high-tailed it to the post office, talked with an employee about the problem (I believe it was a postage due issue), and resolved it. Barring that, he should've been on the phone with me detailing his efforts and the current state of the situation. At the very least, he should've emailed me this information. Instead I got silence. Until I emailed. Until I called. Until I threatened to leave a negative review on every online site I could. That's when Nate called me and explained the situation. And this was two weeks after my order. At over three weeks in, I threw in the towel. I filed a claim with PayPal and requested a refund. And just two days shy of hitting the one month mark, my item finally FINALLY arrived. I've had Etsy items from Canada shipped regular post get to me faster than this. Vegas to San Francisco via USPS Priority Mail shouldn't take more than two days, three if there's a Sunday in between. In the end, I received my item, yes. But what's burned me on Fruition is the poor lack of communication with me throughout the whole ordeal. Basically, they're saying I'm not worth the time. Well, you know what? Neither are they.

 It's Hatch Chile season and the employees here are very excited. Jalapeno Inferno has a separate menu dedicated to food items that contain Hatch Chiles and if you were to ask for recommendation of what to order they will tell you to order off this menu, which of course, we did. To drink, I ordered their Down the Hatch Margarita that contains, guess what....Hatch Chiles! Two different employees passionately suggested this so I was down to try and enjoy this drink. FAIL! So incredibly disgusting that it almost came back up the hatch. Now, I'm not sure if my taste buds haven't matured enough to appreciate Hatch Chile season (that only lasts about a month or so), but my date wasn't a fan of this drink either and I was jealous of his Corona. Thank god the glass had a salt rim because that was the only way I could get the drink down. For my entree I ordered carne asada fajitas that came with 3 freshly warmed tortillas, guacamole, sour cream, shredded cheese, pico de gallo, and a side of refried beans and rice. Yummy! My date order Hatch Chile enchiladas that were really good and should definitely be tried. The chips and salsa were delicious, but who doesn't love deep fried tortilla chips? Service was speedy and the staff was very friendly. The restaurant itself, is very clean, neat, and bright. I would give Jalapeno Inferno another go around if I'm up the area. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This tavern is great. You can choose between having a full meal or just snacking on bar food and the bar is full service. You can also choose between sitting in the main bar area (smoking) or sitting in the dining area (non-smoking). That is the only complaint that I do have. I would like to go and hang out in the bar area and play pool but it is constantly saturated with cigarette smoke. So I am banished to the smaller area with no recreational activities. Not really a place to go have a few drinks if your not really a smoker. I will be coming back to eat, but not to party. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Selection is ok, customer service was horrible. I have given them a few opportunities to earn my business. On two separate occasions I went there to purchase a firearm.

 This review is for the bar attached to the restaurant...which by the way serves the full Sammy's menu 24/7. Kevin B. and I stopped in here last week for some chow after work at about 8. The place had quite a few patrons inside...many of which seemed to be regulars. Despite the fact that the sole bartender was running both the bar and lounge area we received really great service. He greeted us immediately upon sitting down and provided great service throughout the meal. Our beers were comp'd for play and the pizza was quite good; we had the New York Style with mushrooms, pepperoni, salami, and italian sausage. The pizza size is plenty to share if you have a salad or an app. There's also a touch-tunes machine in the bar that you can use to play your own music for 50c per song. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is my second time in Chandler for work, and I've been here about four times. I've basically come here every day during my visits. It's a great place to have a casual meal and get some more work done. I like the food and the friendly service, and also refuse to pay for the wireless in my hotel room (even though my employer would reimburse me for it). Plus, I like the relaxed, community-esque feel of this place. As for the food, I'd recommend the Tuscan Chicken sandwich - the Ciabatta bread it comes on is really quite delicious, but make sure it's fresh. salads are simple, but pretty good, and everything tastes fresh. The chocolate chip cookies are to-die-for. The people who work here are very friendly. One guy was particularly helpful and helped me as I contemplated for about five minutes what I should get. He then came to check how my food was, even though this is a self-service type of place. I would not recommend the half-sandwich half-salad combo if you're really hungry. Somehow a whole sandwich seemed more filling to me. Even though I avoid chain restaurants, I really like this one! Maybe it's because we don't have one in Northern California, so it still makes me feel like this is ""something different"". ",0,0,0,1,0

 Our flight was canceled because the airline failed in replacing the pilot. The pilot who was supposed to fill in to fly our flight refused to do so. It shows how poorly the airline manages the resource. The pilots must be pushed to work to their limit so that they cannot take another flight. Also they canceled the flight after they delayed it for 2 and half hours. When we were handled for an over-night accommodation, there was only a person at the ticket counter to re-book our flights and accommodations. They eventually added more people to help the process, but it took a looooooooooooooong time for us to get out of the airport. Then we were sent to a cheap and uncomfortable motel. The next morning, we found we had been re-booked to the same canceled flight of the previous day. I don't know how their computer system allows the employee to be able to do something like it. We were told there was a good chance to get on to the next morning flight. We went back to the airport only to find it was not true. Then they re-booked us to different flights, which we found out for ourselves. Finally they sent us to United and everything started to work out. I added a star because I try to think positively that we had a few extra hours to see more in LV after we went through all of this incident. ",0,1,0,0,0

 A coveted item that is usually all sold out at other Trader Joe's locations in the LV valley could still be found here, not just first thing in the morning, but even after I returned from just doing my day's activity almost 6 hours later. On top of that, Hannah (one of the friendly and very helpful store associates I spoke to), offered to put the item on hold in the back for me just in case they run out when I got back. That is A+ service right there. The store is practically brand new (since Downtown Summerlin, which it is located in, just opened to the public not even 20 days ago), but you can tell the staff puts in extra effort in keeping the displays, shelves, aisles and the store in near photo shoot ready state. In spite of the huge crowd of customers that descends upon the store in the afternoon. Clear indicator that they collectively are proud and more than likely happy to be working at this Trader Joe's. The overall selections and prices of items here are just as good and reasonable as other Trader Joe's. The quality and freshness of perishable items here however seem to be of extra high quality. But that could just be all the other positive vibes influencing my subconscious perception of the store while I happily shopped here. Trader Joe's just keep doing what you all are doing now, and happy customers will continue to return for more! Service: 5/5 Cleanliness/Store Appearance: 5/5 Parking: 4.5/5 Plentiful, even when the store was packed with customers. Selection: 4/5 Has just about everything you can think of, and then some.

 Oh this was sooo good! We had made same day reservations at 9pm, however, even upon getting there a little early they made us wait! It was strange because we were the only ones waiting for that long. So my boyfriend got a little upset and asked them what was going on, and almost immediately they corrected the problem, apparently it was a screw up on their part. So one would think it would mean the rest of the night would have been spoiled, but instead they gave us one of the best seats in the house right near where all the meat was coming out from the kitchen and right next to the salad bar. Like the other reviews, everything was delicious, my favorite being the pork leg with the crispy skin. Even their sides were tasty and I had to be careful not to fill up on the banana and garlic mashed potato sides! Despite our rocky begining, everything else was perfect. Adam our server was very friendly and chatted with my boyfriend about Brazil, and of course once the other servers found out that my boyfriend spoke a little Portuguese everyone was a little nicer (not that they weren't nice before). This place is a really good place to take a date, and for those other people that didn't like the dim setting, its called a romantic setting! I could still see the food on my plate so I don't know what those other reviews were talking about! Also be sure to sign up for their online email system, we got 25% off our meal!

 The worst experience !!!! My daughter is 20 years old, a room mate and herself tried to rent apt. at Wynn palms apt. they were not approved for it because they did not make enough money but they had given them $199.00 plus app fee. When they tried to get their $199. back( I was there with her), They said she needed to give them $50.00 in order to get money back in 24 hrs. (due to money order issues) When my daughter called back saying she had to put her money into a place to live they told her well you only had 72 hrs to produce the $50.!!! THAT IS A LIE!!!

 I see there are a lot of mixed reviews about this place... Anyhow, I liked the Cheeseburger a lot. Being a vegetarian, I was hesitant at first to eat here. However, my friends and I had been walking around Planet Hollywood and we were starving. It was either the Cheeseburger or the other options (La Salsa, etc.), which didn't sound too great. On top of that, the boys that were with us really wanted burgers. First of all, I was shocked to see how large the menu was. They have a very wide variety of burgers here. And another plus, they had not only one, but two vegetarian options (the usual GardenBurger and a Tofu Burger). I had ordered the Tofu Buger and it was DELICIOUS! My friends had mushroom and swiss burgers, which they all loved. I thought the burgers were very tasty and BIG. Aside from the burgers though, the chilly cheese fries weren't that good. So i don't know about their sides.. But the burgers were great. I like places that can make a good veggie burger, and they did it right here. It is a bit pricey, but they do give you A LOT in your burger. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I shouldn't even give them one star. No refunds. I wanted my money back. There was no work done. The van had not been touched even though it had been here for 4 hours. Corporate policy states no refunds so my choices are to try and wait another 2 hours for them to start and finish, which means screwing over other customers. The other option is the leave and come back another day to do this all over again. Either way, they have my money. What happens if they do the work and I am not happy with the result?

 we came here because my friend recommended we try it. it was a good excuse to get off the strip as well. when we first walked in, it kind of smelled, which bothered me because i hate the smell of fish. but once you settle in, the smell dissipates. ichiza is pretty much a japanese tapas place and we ordered six items for about $25 per person. it was a little pricey for what we got, but i thought all of it was pretty good, except for the excess mayo on the pancake thing. they also have $1.95 beer for happy hour seven days a week. i think this place deserves 3.5 stars instead of 3, but i've definitely had better than this, like at Ronin Izakaya Bistro in West Hollywood and Musha in Torrance. and as for the dessert toast, you get way more bang for your buck at Tokyo Table...it's twice the size of this one for about the same price and it's pretty damn good!

 This is one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants. Or rather, it was. It recently changed hands and isn't as great as it used to be, apparently. I've only been the once, so I'll comment on my experience from this past week. The food was alright. Nothing special or spectacular. The tiramisu was short but quite strong, so that was a plus. The music was horrid. Terrible. And really loud and distracting. The restaurant was also quite cold. I was seating in front of a radiator and I still wanted to put my coat on by the time we had gotten our starters. As a whole, our party (5) enjoyed our meal, but it wasn't anything to rave about.

 This place is odd and seems to be run kind of hap hazard. I've been here one and a half times: once for dinner, and once attempting lunch but we didn't stay. The dinner was pretty good. I had the steak salad and it was good, but over-priced for the amount of steak. Our server was actually the best part of it- she had good recommendations and we were trying to make a movie, so she had us in and out in time to make the previews. Other than the salad, we shared an app, but I can't remember what it was. Meaning it was probably average. My husband had the pork sandwich and said it was really good. All in all, decent food and good service. Ambiance gets a D- it's like eating in one gigantic, loud, dark room with no decor. I can't remember the decor or style in there either. The only way I can describe it is dark and dark. The lunch we attempted was after we tried to hit True Food at 1p and there was still a 30 minute wait. My friend and I both have little ones and weren't interested in waiting in the 110 heat for lunch. We walked into an empty TK's and sat down...only to find out they were out of high chairs. Yes, it was empty, save the one woman with her one child and the three other high chairs she was saving for friends. Not only does the place apparently only have 3 high chairs, but there was zero attempt to accommodate us otherwise. No offer of boosters, no apology, no nothing. Just a shrug and a...and that was it. So, we left and probably won't be back. There are too many great places to eat at the Quarter to waste your time on this one. ",0,1,0,0,0

 GARBAGE!!!! Aside from the whipped cream on Chris' hot chocolate and my coffee, which were both very good, everything was absolutely horrible! I ordered a bacon cheese burger medium rare and Chris ordered chicken fingers and fries. About forty minutes later my burger came out, and a minute or two after that Chris' chicken fingers came out. His chicken fingers were so badly over fried they were inedible! They were hard and dry. the french fries ironically, were soggy and cold. My burger was on par with a basic diner-The meat itself had turned so the color was not right but, I do believe they cooked it medium rare. It was very juicy and not too charred. He forgot the bacon on my burger which was probably better off the burger was pouring grease. We saw our waiter twice when he took the order and when he dropped the check so there was no opportunity to complain. I felt so bad watching Chris crunch on his gross chicken fingers. The vacation was a gift for his birthday, so he was trying his best to be a good sport about it. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My husband and I stopped in for a Sat. lunch. Only 1 waitress was available. She had the outside area plus inside. We ordered sandwiches and when they came, we opened the napkin to get the silverware and were shocked. The silverware was disgustingly dirty with film and stains. I reached to another empty table and tried that silverware, same thing. We finally waited 10 minutes (while our sandwiches got cold) till we could get our waitress. We asked for the manager. He came to the table and when I showed him the silverware, he said he'd make sure this problem was taken care of. No apology. The waitress came back and handled us two sets of wrapped silverware. I said, ""Are these clean?"" She assured us that they were clean. I opened the wrapped silverware and they were just as dirty. Now almost 20 minutes have gone by and we still don't have clean silverware. The waitress finally came back with partially cleaned silverware. We finished our lunch and then sat almost 10 minutes waiting for our check.

 Wonderful service all around. Had a few drinks at the bar before dinner, bartender was great. Food was your standard chops and fish. Very well prepared and tasty. Also a great wine list - I recommend the 2003 Lascombes if you like Bordeaux. The location isnt the best (downtown) if you are looking for fun afterward. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was taken to toast for my birthday. It definitely put a damper on my evening. Our waiter was miserable. When he came back with our drinks he accidentally spilt our beer all over my table and dress. I understand accidents can happen, but then he just left me to deal with the mess. I've never had that happen before, even in casual restaurants. We had to use our dinner napkins to soak up the mess on the table and ended up eating off them. In retrospect we should have just left then, but since it was my birthday we decided to stay and give it a try. Unfortunately the food was very disappointing. My boyfriend's sweet and sour tofu, was literally a single massive block of tofu in broth. All I felt was pity watching him try to eat the bland tofu cube as I sat there in my stained birthday dress. My vegetarian burger was a tasteless mass of pureed lentils between two buns. We left early - disappointed and depressed. Watching my boyfriend actually have to pay for the experience of having my dress ruined, their abysmal service, and bad food was painful. It kind of ruined my birthday night. I guess it guess it goes without saying I won't be eating there again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Botero -- hmmm -- amazingly delish and super great and friendly service. I had the salmon poached in olive oil with jalapeno cream sauce. It was to die for. the salmon just melted like a butter in your mouth. It was that good. My guy had the bass, which also tasted heavenly. The drinks were pricey but still good. The ambiance was romantic, classy, and relax. My guy and I sat outside so it was more cool. Our server Ramon was quick and friendly and gave great service. Price is expensive but the food is amazing.

 Quite the popular asian buffet in the university area. If you can recall the location for the old Ham's, this place moved in a little while ago. Although I haven't tried it until recently, I'm glad I did. I tend to be a Showmars usual in this area, but if I'm feeling a little frisky, I may just wander on over across the road for a more lavish meal, or Asian comfort food. The buffet here is awesome! From Hibachi, to sushi, to chicken, beef, fish, octopus, etc. You name it. It literally wraps around itself, it's so large. Lunch specials during the week- only 7.95. On weekends, I've heard they offer their standard buffet plus unlimited crab legs for 22.95. I have yet to try them out. Staff is friendly, only little interaction with them if you chose the buffet. They keep up with your drink refills without issue. Overall, great Asian buffet! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I like the ambience. The pineapple mojitos were very good. Fresh crushed pineapples. I liked the frito misto and the ribeye steak. We asked for medium-well, but was served almost close to a well done. It was still good. Good seasoning. I was not a fan of the butternut squash soup. Too sweet for me. I would come back when I'm in Vegas, but there are so many restaurants to try! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I drove from Prescott to try this place. I was going to be in Phoenix that day and needed to try something other than my usual DDD place, Chino Bandido. Let me start by saying that I love Guy's suggestions for the most part. Salsa Brava in Flagstaff is excellent. Everything Guy described and more. The same goes for Chino Bandido in Phoenix, it's just as he described. I tried Roberto's at the gas station that was also highlighted on DDD. It's slightly better than Los Taquitos. First off, Los Taquitos had no fountain soda, it was out of order. I ordered the 3 taco plate because the atmosphere was questionable. The place wasn't as clean as I would like so I wanted to order safe. My husband ordered the relleno plate. My taco shells were burnt. His relleno was soggy. The only good part was the rice and beans. I didn't see any chips and salsa on the menu either. The bathroom was pretty bad too. The floor was filthy and there was a hole in the wall that was stuffed with t.p. Don't get me wrong, I can slum it for some great authentic food but I don't see the appeal of Los Taquitos. I felt ripped off and regret going. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I'm rating this as an event venue. I've been here for two different events. And both were very different event types. One was a dinner and country entertainer. The tickets were a good value for the meal. It was a buffet style meal that included many options. The food was fresh and hot. Not like it had been sitting around for a while. The entertainment turned out to be wonderful. All in all, it was a great evening. The second event was a private party. The staff was on top of the set up and maintained everything thru out the evening. Appetizers were served that appealed to both the adults and kids. We had the entire place and it was very nice to be able to be outside on the patio. It's a pretty location for an event. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Alright, this place is a wish come true for those of you like me that seem to crave sweets at the weirdest times. 24 hours of yummy treats! The reason I take a star off is due to the crowd and the line (though it was a Saturday night) and the price which I thought was a little too high. That being said, I whole-heatedly believe it is worth it. I got macaroons, a little chocolate mousse stack with a raspberry on top, and a salted caramel brownie. They were all delicious and by the happy faces and the line itself, I assume most of their items are the same. It has a really neat and creative ambiance and is cozy with a lot of seating inside as well as a few tables outside. The service was great and the workers interacted with the customers and knew the products well. There seemed to be enough of everything, and the staff was super friendly. Overall, very good and I absolutely recommend it. ",0,0,0,1,0

 C-Fu serves up decent dim sum every day from 10:30-2:30. On the weekdays, they still have the carts, but they cram various dim sum items in 2 carts. They have the standard dim sum items such as siu mai (they have it in chicken here, which was interesting), steamed bbq pork bun, har gow, and deep fried taro dumpling. Generally, they all tasted OK, albeit quite oily. I liked the glutinous rice wrapped with lotus leaf the best. The most exotic item there today was the tripe, with no sign of chicken feet or congee with preserved egg. I hear the weekend selection is a lot more diverse though compared to the weekday. Service was very cheerful and friendly, a bit of a surprise since most dim sum restaurants have servers that usually look at you stony-faced while letting you peruse their carts. We got 7 different items, with a total of ~$20 with tax. ",0,0,1,0,0

 As my wife and I were about to be seated in the swan court, the ma \ u00eetre d' said, ""It is an experience of a lifetime."" I didn't believe him until the wait-staff began to take care of us. It was our wedding night and the staff took amazing care of us, giving us complimentary tastes from the chef and being very understanding of my usual lack of attending such a high-quality restaurant. Not being able to see the acrobatics of the 3-story wine cellar was an insignificant issue when I found out we got our own patio area next to the swan pool, for which we were given bread to feed said swans. Everything they did made the evening truly magical and made us feel special. The food was amazing, and when I say amazing - I mean more delicious and well plated than I have likely ever had. As a plus (and this stands out mostly because I am a tech-geek), their wine menu was electronic, like an e-book, and made finding the perfect wine very easy (as well as pointers from our waiter).

 I had dinner here at the end of a long week of conference meetings. Compared to the fast food, food court, and hotel fare I'd eaten throughout the week before, this was a fabulous meal. Compared to any Tex-Mex restaurant in Texas, however, this was pretty bleh. So, for travelers that know good Mexican or Tex-Mex food, you may be disappointed with the flavors here--but given your few eating options in Phoenix, I'd definitely recommend it. Primary food gripes: the salsa was smoky tasting and so dark as to almost look black. The carnitas in my chimichanga were dry and burnt. Little spice or flavor to the overall dish. Positives: Their top shelf margarita was excellent. Just excellent. Also, one of my fellow diners loved the stuffed chicken dish. Service-related: Attentive, friendly service, if a little overly so. Weak or no A/C on in the restaurant while we ate. In June. Not awesome. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I can only speak of the third floor concert venue, so you're on your own if you decide to actually eat at their restaurant. Godspeed! It's definitely a good place to check out a show, particularly if it's general admission, as ours was. There will be confusion when you arrive and try to decide where they woud possibly have a concert in this damned t-shirt shop. Fear not. Walk to the back of the t-shirt shop and go up the stairs. The line will form beginning at the top of those stairs at second floor level (the restaurant). Once the ""doors"" open, you'll move up another flight to the 3rd floor venue. If the show is 21+ you *must* have ID. Yes, even you, you old son of a bitch. Even you. There's a pretty intense search, then you're in. I hope your fellow audience members are as chicken shit as ours were. Most of them lingered in the back by the bar and windows, leaving the entire floor open for the taking. We opted to take about 15 square feet touching the stage, right in front of the lead singer's microphone. We saw Psychedelic Furs this night. I posted a pic taken from our piece of land. Pretty darned impressive! I never thought I'd have Richard Butler sweat on me, but I'll be damned if that didn't happen. The chicken shits soon realized, ""oh, hey, it sure would be cool to be down there in front"" and they tried to commandeer our space. No way, chumps. Good acoustics. I wouldn't hesitate to see another show here. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Second visit and I see what I was missing.... It had to be an off day last time I was in. Perhaps I was off my meds or my taste buds were lazy... who knows. I went back and had the same thing as last time (how is that for stupidity?) The pork was great, no mushy spots, full of flavor, plenty of meat in the bun. The bun was an egg bun, toasted, and complimented the pork perfectly. It was not dry or stale at all. There was plenty of sauce but not too much. The sauce was good, sweet with a nice profile. They still serve only one sauce but have 7 different types of heat you can add. :) The tater salad was fresh, but still just not my thing. I tried to figure out what is it that I do not like about it???? I think it is just not my type. I did however ask to try the beans and slaw... I HAD to find a side I liked. The Beans were it.. Nice spice, and flavor. The slaw was rather good, yet different too. It was as I would say ""lite slaw"" it was crisp and refreshing rather then over sauced and mushy. $10.52 for the Pork, Side and Drink. Service was excellent, place was clean (except the pepper shaker) the owners are great people and love a little conversation. ",0,0,0,0,1

 My wife and I love this place. We go there every Valenties day for the Dinner. We eat there occassionally throughout the year for lunch. They have outside seating that has a beautiful view of the Lake. Our favorite thing about the restaurant is that you can pick from a huge selection of wines. We like to try new wines, and they are always helpful suggesting something based on the wines we know that we like. The food has always been great, and we have never had bad service. They are a little bit on the pricey side, but with good food and a great view it is definitely worth it. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Thai Elephant is our hands down favorite Thai food in the valley.

I regularly drive out from southeast Chandler 20 mins each way for takeout when the family wants Thai, passing probably 15-20 places along the way. The food is simply that good and the portions are monstrous. Great stuff. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I honestly don't even know where to begin. We ended up at Akita tonight based on yelp reviewers stating that it's $11.99 all you can eat Sat-Mon. It was a toss up between Geisha's awesome Sunday specials and this. We decided to give someplace new a shot... We sat down, all you can eat dinner menu in hand, no prices in sight, conveyer belt not on.. We ordered a few spring rolls, edamame, the pork cutlet, and a seaweed salad. The only thing that made it out was the salad... When it came to the sushi, every roll that should have been cold was warmer than room temperature (still crossing fingers that we don't get sick). I decided to try and order some appetizers again.. I ordered two spring rolls, two scallops, a calamari tempura and a shrimp tempura. We eventually got ONE spring roll, ONE scallop, and shrimp tempura... No calamari in sight. Okay... Wanting to at least end on a sweet note, we ordered the fried bananas and vanilla ice cream. My thought was to eat the fried banana WITH the ice cream, however, the bananas came out about 10 minutes after the ice cream, therefore, that was already demolished. I felt that even with all of the screw ups, it was almost decent enough to be what I thought would be a $24 bill for two people. WRONG!!! To my surprise, dinner is apparently $19.99 a person, which nearly doubled my expectation. Knowing that I could have had an amazing meal at Geisha for half of what I paid is still not sitting well with me. It is also worth noting that nobody that works here seems to know what they are supposed to be doing. We had three different people taking our orders, which probably explains why we didn't get half of our food. They should really think about giving customers an order sheet/pencil like most other sushi restaurants. It would probably make it much easier on the employees and give the customers a better experience. They should also, perhaps, post prices somewhere. Even if it's just on the big white hand written poster boards taped all over the building advertising the all you can eat special. There was no place to verify prices since there is no website either. In conclusion, Akita really needs to get their sh*t together if they want to stay open. We definitely don't plan on going back anytime soon... If ever... ",1,0,0,0,0

 So my usual nail technician moved to California!!! NOOOOOO!!!! Has my world collapsed?!?! Fear not, Furama Nails is just down the road and is FANTASTIC! It's in the same shopping strip as the Safelite call center and has plenty of parking. I walked in with no appointment on a Monday afternoon and was immediately taken care of (no surprise there). The interior is beautiful and clean. I got a basic mani just to test the waters with it being my first new nail place in 5 years. They were very gentle with my unruly cuticles, no bleeding. The hand massage was a tad short, but maybe I was just spoiled with my previous tech. My nails looked fantastic for the week, no chipping, my nails didn't dry out or tear. I will definitely be back for a pedi and gel mani. They also have a rewards card for each time you go.

 I went today for first time. Sat quickly, waited 15 minutes for water and sodas. Most of the food was barely warm, apple pie dough not cooked enough, shushi was ok, fried chicken good, crispy and hot.

Broccoli by itself, chicken by itself, pork by itself, cold noodles by their self, etc. Could've used some Mongolian Beef or Chicken, Moo Goo Gai Pan, Pepper Steak, etc. They did have Snow Crab but they aren't worth the work.

 We ate at Merry-Ann's Diner in December of 2010 and our entire experience was very disappointing. First, we struggled to even get into the building due to an ice buildup on the sidewalks, common sense says that you at least take the time and salt your sidewalks for your customers safety. Our waitress acted like she had better things to do than to take our order. When our orders arrived my husband ate about 80% of his but explained that the flavor was ""lacking"" and that his food was ""very greasy"". My order was virtually inedible...literally only ate a couple of bites and was unable to stomach anymore of it due to the horrible flavor and excessive grease. The two best things about our meal was our coffee and getting the bill so that we could leave. The restaurant itself was dirty. The only positive thing that I would guess that this diner is good for is a hangover fix...unfortunately we weren't hungover college kids and were actually expecting a good meal, which did not happen.

 We went there for the first time yesterday, and I would definitely recommend Spartan Pizza. Here's why: - the crust is thin, crunchy on the bottom, chewy on top - the sauce is sweet and savory - the cheese is rich and delicious - the veggies were fresh and tasty We ordered the Canadian bacon deluxe (with onions, green peppers, green & black olives, and mushroom too I think). The Canadian bacon tasted like real meat and is among the best I've had ... not at all like that heavily processed stuff you usually get at the store. The CBD is naturally quite salty from the bacon and olives but I like that. We also had the small salad which was just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes, but what can you expect for $2? I'd bet the pizza salad is much better. The service was casual and friendly. In regards to the atmosphere, we ate in the parlor booth area which is clean enough and family-friendly but quite dated in appearance. We left through the adjoining room which is a bar that has been added on and is much more modern and was populated by locals drinking and eating dinner around the bar. I should also note that the plates for eating pizza are plastic. This is a ""no frills"" kind of place. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I made plans for lunch with one of my Republic friends and we decided to give Breadfruit a try. I had read mixed reviews, but figured they had worked all of the kinks out by now. My take? The food was fresh but not savory or super-tasty. I started with the plantain avocado spring roll. The chutney was delicious and saved the dish. Without it? I probably wouldn't have bothered. My entree was the jerk chicken. Overall, there was a good amount of heat with no depth of flavor. My friend ordered the jerk shrimp and wasn't impressed. She even complained that the slaw was under-seasoned and bland. Overall, it's one of those things...I guess it's hard to keep things seasoned and juicy when you have a big lunch rush. Plus, the restaurant was really warm, temperature-wise. It's a small space with the kitchen just off the dining area, so it might have been radiating from there. There are several vegetarian and vegan options on the menu, which is a plus. I will definitely be back for another try--possibly to try the curried tofu. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Yulk is what comes to mind first! It rook 3 times to get my order right. I said sauce on side waitress brought it back with extra sauce.

We were checked on by the waitress who was on her cell phone & eating. Phone to ear trying to see what we needed. Final blow was attemptimg to pay the tab.

 I absolutely hate writing anything negative -- especially about a pet store that I really like. I really do love the Mounds organization. The organization is truly dedicated to animals and is involved with working to reduce pet overpopulation. The Mounds Dogfest held every year in Sun Prairie, WI is a great event. It's even where I met my dog's breed rescue group which I eventually adopted my dog from. I really do respect and admire this company. With that being said, I have yet to have a pleasant shopping experience at the East Madison Mounds store. The staff people stand around in aisles together and chit-chat -- I've seen this happen all six times I've been there. Customer service there is lacking. Very much lacking. Never once have I been greeted as I enter this store. And as much as I can remember, sales associates were indeed present at the front when I entered. In fact, during my most recent visit, two were standing together, chit-chatting, and absolutely ignored me. This is such a shame. In contrast, my shopping experiences at the Janesville Mounds have been quite the opposite -- the sales associates very enthusiastic to see me, greet me, help me with any questions, and genuinely appreciative that I'm a customer. Like I said, I think this is a wonderful company with wonderful goals. Unfortunately, this one Mounds store has very poor customer service. I wish they could/would correct this. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Sprouts is a pretty good place to grocery shop. The best place I have found in this area so far. It was disappointing to walk into a store with a name like ""Sprouts- Healthy, Natural, and Organic Grocery store"" and see that about 80% of the produce section was not organic and to see several products containing high fructose corn-syrup. I was surprised to see how small the organic produce section is in relation to the size of the non-organic section and was a bit disappointed that some of the produce for which I was shopping was not available in the organic variety. They do have a large selection of high-quality and natural foods as well. You just have to make sure to do a lot more label-reading than you would expect to have to do in a ""Healthy, Natural, and Organic Grocery Store."" They are thoroughly mixed in with non-healthy, unnatural, and non-organic items. Also pretty disappointed to see the cashier automatically start loading up my groceries in plastic grocery bags.

 Archie's is a Thai restaurant chain with locations convenient to both my work and home. I love their lunch specials for the good portions and value. I would recommend their Pad Thai lunch and Kung Pao chicken (better than Chinese kung pao). They serve consistently good Thai food with my only complaint being the spice number is not consistent. I've asked for spicy number 5s that may be more like a three on some days and like a nine on others. Yikes! But it's so good, I'll eat it anyway. I would suggest not getting the salads or the soups too spicy because the spice tends to overwhelm these dishes. Better to add more spice later than be sorry. Besides the lunch specials, a few other favorite dishes of mine are the Panang curry, Massaman curry and Tom Kha Gai soup. If in season, try the mango and sticky rice for dessert. Love it!

 We've ordered from here 4 times in the year since we moved to Henderson. All 4 times have been full of meh... This last time I've finally decided no more. It's probably been a few months at least since we've ordered so when I called they had a new menu. I wanted wings and some fried shrimp... Well it's never that easy. The menu changed and apparently no one knows what to do as usual. Woman on the phone took multiple times to get the order correct then said deliver or pickup, I said pickup... Do you want me to call back with the total price? Well why don't you have it right away???? The menu went from a 3 page foldout to a 1 page print that someone did at the UPS Store... It says wings but not how many but of course the price is there! Great location but waste of space. Get it together guys. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I went there last night with bf to celebrate our anniversary. After pre-yelp, we knew what to expect as to prices, so it wasn't so much of a shocker. To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasn't too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastro's is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that. For main course, I got Ivory Salmon ""Oreganata"", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes ""surpassed expectation."" I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course. Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge. Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers' reviews. Total worth it!!! The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again. We didn't order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate ""Happy Anniversary"" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasn't very good and it got loud. Didn't see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room. And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of ""expense account"" people though ",0,0,0,0,1

 Remedy's is your average, down the street, neighboorhood watering hole. Food is consistent (when they are not changing the menu) and the happy hours are well.... Happy? LOL Other then being one of only a handful of bars that I can stumble home from, there is not much else to say..... Oh..... the evening/swing wait staff here are generally pretty cool and do try and remember what you drink if you come in enough. Granted, I have not been in awhile, so I am not sure if this still holds true. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This place is decent when it comes to nails but they will not take you in even you come in at 6:50 & they close at 7 which I think is horrible because other nail places will take you even at the time of closing. I will never go there again especially after the horrible service they gave me the last time I was there. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Heute testeten wir voller Vorfreude das afrikanische Restaurant im Herzen von Karlsruhe. Nach unserem pers \ u00f6nlichen Eindruck, den wir hier widergeben, war es die mit Abstand schlechteste Gastst \ u00e4tte, die wir jemals besuchten, und das waren schon viele. Leser mit stabilem Magen k \ u00f6nnen jetzt weiterlesen. Wir suchten uns ein Pl \ u00e4tzchen im Garten, der sich uns als sehr ungepflegt vorkam. Neben unserem Tisch standen traurige K \ u00fcbelpflanzen mit blattfreien \ u00c4sten aber einer Menge Unkraut. Kein Problem, der n \ u00e4chste Pflanzk \ u00fcbel strotzte nur so vor Leben, \ u00fcbers \ u00e4t mit Blattl \ u00e4usen aller Art. F \ u00fcr uns bis dahin kein Grund zum \ u00c4rgern sondern nur zum Wundern. Wir bekamen von der Bedienung fix die Speisekarten gereicht, die nicht nur zerknittert waren sondern auch schon einige Flecken aufwiesen. So etwas legt man G \ u00e4sten nicht auf den Tisch. Immerhin konnte keiner etwas f \ u00fcr den spontanen Vogelkot, der neben der vertrockneten Tischrose vom Himmel fiel. Naja, weiter gehts. Vor dem Essen w \ u00e4scht man sich die H \ u00e4nde wir h \ u00e4tten es besser sein gelassen. Die Papierhandt \ u00fccher waren leer, also bedient sich der findige Gast eben beim Toilettenpapier. Die ungepflegte Sch \ u00fcssel (Haare auf der Toilettenbrille) schm \ u00e4lerte den Appetit nun doch ein wenig. Die Getr \ u00e4nke kamen schnell, beim Bitter Lemon war kunstvoll der Eichstrich auf den Millimeter getroffen, beim Ginger Ale gab es deutlich Luft nach unten. Die Bedienung konnte mit der Bezeichnung der Getr \ u00e4nke nur wenig anfangen und fragte nach den entsprechenden Nummern in der Speisekarte man ist ja gerne behilflich. Aufgrund mannigfaltiger Erlebnisse in so kurzer Zeit vergingen die ca. 15 Minuten bis zum Essen wie im Flug. Gereicht wurde eine vegetarische Platte mit gelben Linsen, bei denen wir uns nicht sicher waren, ob sie so s \ u00e4uerlich schmecken sollten oder ob die Qualit \ u00e4t des Lebensmittels etwas gelitten hatte. Der Blattsalat mit Tomate war warm, was an der r \ u00e4umlichen N \ u00e4he zu den Linsen lag, die auf dem gleichen Teller serviert wurden. Dazu gab es geschnittene Kartoffeln und Karotten, die in einer Br \ u00fche schwammen und nach unserer Ansicht v \ u00f6llig verkocht waren. Alles was ich bislang aufgez \ u00e4hlt habe, lag \ u00fcbrigens eintr \ u00e4chtig gemeinsam auf derselben Platte. Das Fladenbrot, das nach unserem Eindruck etwas muffig schmeckte, nahmen wir zur Kenntnis. Naja, vielleicht isst man das alles so, unseren Geschmack traf es nicht. Der Bulgur war prima, da konnte man nichts falsch machen. Jeder Kritikpunkt f \ u00fcr sich w \ u00e4re eine unwesentliche Begleiterscheinung, in der geballten Masse f \ u00fcr uns jedoch eine Zumutung. Der eine Stern ist systembedingt zu vergeben, 0 Sterne f \ u00e4nden wir angemessen. Wir ergriffen die Flucht und genossen woanders unser Abendessen. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I have resisted writing a review of Nicky's for a long time since I've tended to view this place as my own for the last 5-6 years. I've only ever recommended it to my closest friends in an attempt to keep the crowds down and to preserve this as a special, hidden gem for only MY use. I've taken friends there to introduce them to the pleasures of a truly great dining experience and EVERY ONE of them has been blown away. Alas, when the Pittsburgh Magazine list of top 25 restaurants included Nicky's, I knew it was over. Now I have to share this place with the great unwashed who haven't grown up with it like I have over the last several years. It pains me. Simply stated, this is WAY better that top 25. It might be top 2 or 3 in Pittsburgh. It's THAT good. But you won't like it so don't bother to go. (Will that keep you away and restore my own private relationship with Nicky's to what it used to be???) First off, the appearance from Western avenue is not very inviting. You walk into a somewhat decrepit looking building down a hallway to the hostess station. You can see into the kitchen and all the activity and smells that emanate from there are assurance that you've come to the right place and that this is gonna be GOOD! You don't know the half of it. Seating options are inside or out. Outside is a magical garden filled with plants I didn't know could exist on the Northside. How they keep the appearance of an urban jungle is beyond me - but the atmosphere is instantly relaxing and soothing. A host of Thai-related accents, umbrellas over the tables, brick walls - all take you so far away from the Northside you can't even imagine you aren't in Southeast Asia. With a no corkage fee (except on weekends) policy it's one of the best place for BYOB in the city. So bring some wine or champagne and feast your eyes on the menu. Oh my. If you can read through that without needing to wipe the drool from your mouth you need to have somebody check your pulse I've eaten here probably 35 times or more and have sampled so many things - not one of which I didn't rave about or wouldn't order again. The flavors are unlike anything you'll see anywhere else. Thai food is one of my all time favorite cuisines and Nicky's tops the list! And don't associate Thai food with HOT - it isn't unless you want it to be. I always do - on a scale of 1-10 I always order ""Thai Hot"" which is above 10. But the flavors? The curries, noodles, spring rolls, pork/chicken/fish dishes, the soft-shell crabs - all filled with amazing sauces and flavors that you want to savor every bite. My mouth is watering even now as I think about it. Amazing. Plus, if you're a vegetarian, you have a huge selection of entrees that will knock your socks off. Service is always excellent and attentive. Specials are so tempting and the price is right. I couldn't recommend it more highly. I could eat there several times a week. Wonder if they have a meal plan???? ",0,0,0,0,1

 I finally went to this place after hearing all my friends rave about it. I figured ok I'm in Charlotte so let me try this place. Ok, the iced coffee taste like water! WTF? But the doughnuts were really, really, surprisingly good! The glazed doughnuts were given to me fresh off the conveyor and it was just warm and so soft. I couldn't wrap my head around how the doughnut was so soft. It literally melts in your mouth. The doughnuts definitely rival some of the best I've had in NYC. ",0,0,0,1,0

 It's our first time in Vegas, and we wanted to see pen and teller. I got will call tickets and was stressed out about not sitting together, so we rushed to the rio. Because it was there we decided to eat at carnival. There was plenty of food, but it kinda sucked. My husband is a big boy, and he only got one plate of food if that tells you anything. I thought the prime rib was good., a little salty. I got a rancid crab leg (that made my hand smell the rest of the night no matter the soap) so that turned me off the crab. Sesame ball dim sum was the best thing I tried, oh and the menudo was the bomb. I didn't pay 30 bucks a pop though for seeds and tripe, so 2 stars. Save the cash and go somewhere else. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My 15 year old cousin was visiting from Utah and I decided to take her here to do something fun together and to try the place out. She had the acrylic full set done and I had a pedi. We also had coupons but ended up paying more because they said they had used a more expensive polish after the fact, which we were never asked for, but ended up paying for it. I thought it was rude, but paid anyway. Two days later my cousins nails changed to a yellowish color and the nails were chipping on the edges. We went back to the salon to get them re-done, with an open mind and not aggressive at all. From the moment the older lady working there saw her nails (we think the owner), she started scolding us very defensively saying that it wasn't the salon's fault or her products that it must be something my cousin was eating or her make up. The reaction and comments that we received was/were extremely racist saying that ""you Mexican's like to eat tamales and that's what happen"", ""all the spicy food"" and also accused my cousin of being a liar. I'm not a confrontational person and avoid being disrespectful. I immediately told her that she was also a minority and she shouldn't say racist things and to treat people, specially her customers the way she would like to be treated. My cousin explained to her that she gets them done all the time and this problem has never happen before. While we were there another young girl came in asking to get her nails fixed for the same problem. I will diffidently not come back and I suggest everyone to avoid this place. There are plenty of great salons with professional technicians that would appreciate the business. ",1,0,0,0,0

 For a place that flies a highway billboard advertising a $24/nite rate for CDL holders, and that's attached to a small divey casino, this really wasn't bad. Room cleanliness was questionable in certain spots (carpet and shower) but the bed and towels were fine and that's all I really care about. TV gets one HBO and a handful of broadcast channels, and those very staticy, but the free wifi is actually decent. Small room, no coffee maker in room (it's free at the casino bar though), no fridge and micro, but it seems like you can usually get a weeknight rate of about $30 here and that's with a free Dennys breakfast (the $4 value slam or a 2 egg cheese omelete with toast and hash browns) thrown in. For that rate, it was fine. And surprisingly the cliente seemed to mostly be big families on vacation and truckers (there's two huge lots for RVs and trucks on either side of the place) rather than meffsters and prossitoots. Not much in the way of amenities but they do have a good sized laundry room and a decent sized pool that looks like Minnie Mouse's head and has tons of lounging area. Desk staff was very nice too though you do have to go into the casino to check in. AC looked like it's been there since the 80s but it held up well and the white noise drowned out everything. They were nice enough to give me a room with the bed up against a cleaning supply room or something not used for guests so I slept like a rock the whole stay too. Location is about a 10 minute walk to the strip, Excalibur and the Mandalay Bay and Luxor shuttle are the closest things. Basic fast food all around if you get sick of Dennys - In and Out, Jork in the Bork, Wendys, McDs, Burger King, Subway and several gas stations with booze and snacks all within a quick walk. And some sort of city bus route stops right outside and goes over to the Strip too. Oh and $2 domestic pints anytime over at the casino bar. I'll probs go back at some point. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Came here thanks to a coupon special. If I had known how big the portions were before I came, I wouldn't have bothered buying the coupon. Hash House is located in the M Hotel. Nice place, both of them. Waited 5 minutes for a table on a Saturday night. The service was the hang up. Our waitress was nice, but she was the only one I saw in the place, servicing a dozen tables and bringing out plates the size of hubcaps. Seriously. We ordered Fried Green Tomatoes to start 4 slices, each about an inch thick, with goat cheese and balsamic syrup. I wanted it to be good, but it was just ok. Something was missing, like flavor, maybe? The garnish was a thick slice of watermelon, and that was my favorite thing about the dish. For entr \ u00e9es we ordered the crab cakes and the Pounded Pork tenderloin. Again, if I'd known about the portion sizes, we would have split a salad and an entr \ u00e9e, but ce la vie. My plate was 20 inches of thinly sliced, fried something covered in brownish-red gravy, sitting atop a mountain of fried mashed potatoes. It looked completely unappetizing. I'm not sure what the meat was, probably pork, but it WASN'T tenderloin. I took one bite and couldn't eat any more. Under the meat/gravy combo were some really nice mashed potatoes with roasted tomatoes and caramelized onions, but I had to peel back a scab of fried cheese to even get to them. The whole meal was a turn-off. The crab cakes, however, were thick and light, drizzled with a nice red-pepper roumelade and served with some yummy roasted squash and green beans. It was a solid 3.5 star dish, especially for the size/price. We finished with a completely unremarkable bread pudding for dessert. The whole meal came to about $70, and could easily have been about half that if not for the stupid coupon. Totally my bad. I would like to try the place again and order more approprietly. We saw several other people eating in the restaurant and their food looked good. The comments I overheard seemed positive as well. SO, I say, give it a shot. The M Hotel is in BFE, but it could be worth the drive for the value. ",0,1,0,0,0

 PROS: - Stayed in the North Tower of the hotel with a view of the north side of the strip. $40 on a Saturday. Pretty good. - Near EVERYTHING we love in Vegas... very easy walking distance to everything. - Parking was somewhat close (had to go through Paris), but easy. - Room was renovated (we think?) and was more than adequate for our $40 one-night stay. - Bed was comfortable and linens were seemingly clean. - Bathroom was much larger than most ""standard"" hotel rooms on the strip. And clean with lots of towels. - Ballsy has one of my favorite casinos, and connected to Paris, which also has a great casino. - Express check-out made it a whole lot easier. - Widescreen TV (not HD), but still had all the channels we liked. CONS: - Check-in took FOREVER. - On the way to Hotel Registration, was stopped by a guy trying to sell us on a hotel package.... we had just arrived and I was flu-ish and the last thing we needed was to be held up by a guy trying to sell us a bad deal. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get get rid of this promotion... NO ONE WILL BUY IT!!!! - Concierge says no restaurants in the hotel are open after midnight. So when we returned to our room at 1pm and needed something eat -- whatever, as long as it's close -- our only option was heading to Paris or somewhere across the street. Trudge, trudge, trudge. And the cold air from the cold night was sobering. (Ballys -- Your Sea website says they're open until 2am, but yet they closed at midnight. Pffft.) - Bottled water at the gift shop is $5. - Wi-Fi is $14. Cellular service on the iPad sucked. All in all, I'd probably book again, but will bring some snacks with me in the future. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We tried the teriyaki chicken and Asian spicy chicken. Both were very good! If this was located a little closer to us, we'd definitely come back on a regular basis. Wide variety to choose from on the menu including crab puffs, edamame, etc. If I could rate 4.5 I would - the only downside is that it's small inside so not the most welcoming place to eat, but if you want something delicious on the go, this is it.

 I'm such a huge fan of hole-in-the-walls. As my friend Andrew W. once said, they have nothing else going for them but their food. Therefore, the ones that stay open are successful by the sole virtue of their food. And that's exactly why I'm giving 5 stars to Mr. Sam and his cafe of dive heaven. I have many regrets from my college career. One of these is that I didn't discover Sam's until late in the game. I get to experience two of my favorite words here: CHEAP BRUNCH. Breakfast platter special for $3.75??? Fluffy french toast for under $5???? Pancakes? Omelettes!!!?? OH YES PLEASE GIMME NAO I WANT IT I WANT IT SO BAD. Footnotes: DO NOT eat here if: - you are on a diet. I don't think the cooks know what that word means. No Lite Butter or Diet Fat Free Bacon to be found here. - you are a snob. The ""decor"" consists of plastic furniture and faded ads in lieu of actual ceiling tiles. - you are a germaphobe.... but really, why would you be? Snap out of it, take a class in immunology. Germs ain't got nothin' on you. (Sorry, bio nerd leaking through.) DO eat here if: - you are a broke-ass college kid. Full meals for under $5 ... how could you resist? - you love breakfast foods. The french toast is particularly noteworthy. Advice: CASH ONLY; FOR BFAST, CLOSES AT 2 PM (I think - it's been a long time since I was there. It's either 2 or 1...) ",0,0,0,0,1

 I strongly believe that clubs are only as fun as you make it to be. Pure is the 2nd club I have ever visited in Vegas and I had a great time!! Club is located right next to the Poker rooms at Caesar's Palace. Entrance Fee: FREE!! We were walking around the Casino at Caesar's Palace earlier on in the day and a club promoter gave us tickets. All girls in our group got in for free and the guys paid about $20 (not bad considering all other clubs on Memorial weekend was charging up the butt for entrance fees. Marquee @ Cosmopolitan was charging $50 for girls and $100 for guys...yeah..i don't think so). Drinks: Umm...holy cow...if they didn't get you in the entrance fee, they will get you with the drinks!! For 3 shots, I paid $48...what?! Yeah...minus 1 star for that. However, bartenders are nice here! Club Ambiance: Loved the white theme and lighting in here. My friends and I also loved the music!! There is great energy here and my gfs and I did not want to leave the dance floor. This place does get crowded though...by 1 am, you start to get pushed and feel like cattle being herded. Watch out for drinks spilling too! We had to call it a night by 1:30am- there was just TOO many people in here. Overall: Loved that we got in for free, loved the vibe and enjoyed this club MUCH better than Tao...I may come back!! :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 Just moved into downtown, and ordered here after move-in day. When I walked in to carry out, the restaurant was full with a huge bachelorette party. Two women were belting out Lady Gaga over the karaoke machine, with the rest of the party singing along. Be warned. Ordered Tom Kha and Chicken larb. The larb was okay. As for the former, the reviews below are right: something is up with the Tom Kha soup. There's an odd nuttiness--almost like peanut butter--in the soup that clashes with both the coconut and any heat in the soup. More positively, the tofu in the soup was fine, and there were a good amount of mushrooms. Not sure I'll go back. Feeling scarred by the karaoke and confused by the Tom Kha. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Beer! And hot dogs! And smoked chicken leg! And GIN! (So much gin). It's only right that my first review of 2013 be a 5 star one of newest beer bar in the Old Town, The Hanging Bat. It opened to a hushed drum roll of anticipation. A coming together of some of Edinburgh's best beer drinkers, from the likes of Brew Dog and Holyrood 9a, as well as a Slow Food chef who had worked in some top restaurants, it had a lot resting on its shoulders / wings (do bats have shoulders? Hmm anyway.) I didn't go for a while after it opened. I wanted to, I really did. But I wanted my first visit to include all it was known for already: beer and gourmet hot dogs. Walking in, I immediately warmed to it. Well, it was warm inside anyway, and smelled of delicious smokey, peaty smokiness. That'll be from all the meat that is smoked inhouse: like the smoked chicken leg, the pulled pork and the hot dogs. It's on three floors as well. Not much room on the floor with the bar, but a wee upstairs balcony provides plenty of sofas and window bar stools, whilst downstairs much the same. The toilets are up the back beyond the kitchen (more smokiness) and a window that shows into their current brewing creation. I know it's been shouted about before, but their toilets are worth mentioning. Half kegs as sinks, and beer taps as water taps! Eep! I don't know a LOT about beer. But I do know what beer I do and don't like. Luckily they have so many you're bound to get something you like. And they have a nice idea of serving 5 different 1/3 pints with tokens so you can try 5 different beers. They do only serve to a maximum of 2/3 pints (never a full pint). I think this is because they believe, in their beer connoisseur imbibing abilities, that after 2/3 of a pint the last 1/3 has gone flat and a bit warm and not as nice. It's true really. People have complained about this but, well, even if it is very 'ooo we know beer' and some people can interpret that as snobby, I think it makes sense. So they've got lots of beer, lots of craft beer, lots of fruit beer, lots of German beer, they've even got a list called 'Unusual Beers' or something. They have 4 different types of meat on their menu, as well as Beer Mac 'n' Cheese and Beer Cake, they've got comfy sofas. So people can come here and drink beer but not in the traditional Scottish old man boozer type surroundings. They can come here and drink beer accompanied by delicious hot dogs (there's 4 different types, and the one that comes with haggis is brilliant. The haggis itself is some of the best I've tried). I'm not a big beer drinker, but I can see The Hanging Bat changing that. Oh and did I mention the gin? They have around 20 on the menu. Really impressive considering spirits aren't even the first order of the day. ",0,0,0,0,1

 YOU WILL BE VERY MAD AT YOURSELF FOR SPENDING ANY TIME OR MONEY HERE - I WAS! My six friends and I went to Vegas for 5 days in Aug/Sept 2012.

 Alright...as we all know the scene in Phoenix is horrible. So, due to lack of options, we are forced to go to places like Z Girl Club, formerly known as Mistys. The sad thing is that Mistys/Z Girl club used to be a really fun place to go to. In the last two years or so, the place has honestly gone to crap. Let's start with the music, since that is a key component to a nightclub, right? It sucks. Flat out sucks. My grandmother could play better music. They have played the same crap for years. Do you hear the newest stuff? No. Not even a chance. Even if you ask the DJ, there is a good chance it won't happen. The drinks - a second key component. Same ol, same ol. No good drink specials, the good drinks are overpriced. And you have to pay cash. Meaning if you are like me and don't carry cash, you have to go to the ATM there and pay the effing terminal fee. Classy and cool. That's what I want to do when I'm out. Now to the people that go there. It used to really be a good mix. Now, not so much. No style. There was a girl wearing Pj's. WTF?!?!?! Since when does Lesbian = scrubby and lazy? Stay in your living room if that's how you want to dress. Seriously. And the place does nothing to enforce a dress code.

 I went to Porte Greque tonight for my first time tonight (Monday Night) and I was very dissatisfied. I went because I had a coupon--2 meals, each with soup and dessert for 20$--that I received for supporting a local sports team. The soup of the day was white bean soup. It was okay but nothing special. I ordered the Shish Kabab; marinated pork tenderloin skewered with onions and green peppers. I have to admit that the pork was very good and moist, but the kabab had only 2 tiny pieces of pepper and 3 tiny onion pieces. The salad was an obvious cheap-out. A huge bed of iceberg lettuce with a quarter of a tomato, a few cucumbers, and barely any dressing. (Was it a store-bought dressing? I don't know... I could barely taste it over the blandness of the iceberg.) The rice was the standard yellow rice that is served at so many other Greek restaurants. The potatoes were nice and crispy on the outside but bland on the inside. There were no choices for dessert other than chocolate cake. It was okay, but I am not a huge fan and would have liked something other than chocolate cake. The service was okay; our waitress was friendly and helpful. Parking was not an issue because it is a private lot. ",0,1,0,0,0

 A close friend was looking to come back here and have a good meal, so we made some time to get off the strip and chow down. It was a 30 minute or so wait before we could even get a seat (that popular on a Sunday night?) but when the food arrived, it was well worth the wait. As mentioned by other Yelpers, the menu is scattered across the wall and you really have to look around to understand what your best options are. We ordered a mix of 12+ items from the menu, and here's what I remember that I would reoder: Ramen - Excellent broth, springy noodles that aren't made in house, but nonetheless delicious. The egg is cooked perfectly so that the yolk is just barely oozing out and the white is firm. Great flavor and execution. Beef Bowl - As other have mentioned, the beef bowl is filling and tasty. Honey Toast - I've never tasted anything quite like this before, and it was enjoyable. Huge piece of bread that's toasted, then drizzled with honey with ice cream on top. Leave room for this large dessert. The inside was the best part (chewy, soft, and sweet bread mixed with honey and ice cream). The outside was a bit more burnt than preferred. Interesting textural difference. Verdict: While I can't remember the rest of the dishes I had here, I have to say, I enjoyed the whole meal and no dishes stood out as something I wouldn't re-order... come for the snacks/meals, and don't come for sushi. It's an excellent place to enjoy some good Japanese food! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I have a dream for downtown Phoenix, and that is that all of the art-houses, such as Lost Leaf would endorse alcohol, wine, and spirits during the 30 other days outside of First Friday (gag!) and kitsch the fuck out of our downtown. Really, considering all of the exquisitely designed and perfectly placed art-houses in the central area, our sleepy little downtown would be one of the coolest, most unique places in the US. Sadly, only Lost Leaf has truly embraced this idea, and they've made good on their attempt. Bottled beer and wine are about the only thing you can get here, but their selection is interesting and their prices moderate. Their set-up is really bistro-esque, but it works. Plus the fact that the LL is a part-time gallery is a cool requirement for placing a heap of engaging art on the walls. Edit: Recently discovered that Monday's are Jazz Night and are freaking AWESOME. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Dumpy little place with killer food. I tried the sesame chicken lunch special. It was hot and sour soup, egg roll, white rice and lightly breaded chicken covered in brown sauce and sesame seeds. There was not one thing that was bad. It was all good. Under $7 bucks out the door. ",0,0,0,1,0

 If you're looking for an honest mechanic with unparalleled service and professionalism, then Tait and the Hon-Man crew is the obvious choice. But if you're looking for a decent Turkish bath house nearby to relax in while you're car is getting serviced, then you're shit out of luck in this neighborhood. Fortunately, Tait has a very comfortable waiting room with Wi-Fi, DirecTV & free snacks - but no steam room...yet. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Don't waste your money, it's the worst Chinese food ever!!! Just picked up an order of chicken lo mein for dinner. I ordered a pint and they made a quart, told lady I wanted a small, she smiled and said sorry we made a large and walked away. These people need to learn how to season and cook food. Absolutely freaking awful. Would have been better to have skipped dinner and just thrown the money in the trash. Stay far away or make your own Chinese home. ",1,0,0,0,0

 PROS: Really enjoyed the sushi here. Sat at the bar and tried the carpaccio, kaiso, sake, iwana, hamachi, ikura, unagi, spicy hotate and spicy cary maki. All amazing. The seaweed salad was memorable and fresh. Wish Texas offered a sushi restaurant with this kind of seaweed. Also amazing was their 1000 crepe stacked dessert. Wow.

 I have gotten wings from the Monk before and they are always on the light side from flavor but usually very meaty and seem fresh. Tonight we got buffalo and honey hot wings to go to.

 The pizza itself was mediocre at best, I ate it but it's nothing to write home about. $20.00 for one large 3 topping pizza is a bit pricey I think. Delivery time was off by 15 minutes late. And to top it all off, when paying by card you are asked to add a tip when the driver gets there. WTF? I,m being charged a separate DELIVERY CHARGE and I'm expected to tip too? Isn't the tip the delivery charge? Hell, why not throw on a road tax charge of a couple bucks and maybe a fuel tax charge and an environment tax charge, then you can justify $30.00 for a pizza. There's gotta be something better than this. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Kabuto is, without a doubt and in my personal opinion, the best sushi restaurant in the United States. When the Michelin Guide returns to Las Vegas, this restaurant is worthy of multiple Michelin stars. You may search many places in many cities, but it is unlikely that you will find truly pure sushi like what you will find at Kabuto. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING that is served here melts in your mouth. The fish is to die for and I have often found that I am ruined after my meals that I have had here. There just isn't any other sushi restaurant that lives up to Gen-san's, short of spending thousands of dollars to fly to Ginza to eat at Sukiyabashi Jiro. Don't walk, run, and make reservations as soon as possible. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This is the best nightclub I have ever been too, especially in Vegas. The entire vibe of the place is great and everyone was there to have a good time and party in true Las Vegas fashion. We went during ""Party Rock Mondays"" in July and was worried because of all the hype surrounding the place, and it def. lived up to the hype. Never at a nightclub have I received such amazing customer service from everyone working there between the bartenders, waitress', bussers, hosts, etc. Did not experience any pretentios attitude. We went in through general admission because we were staying at the cosmo and got in for free. After walking around the place, which is huge and sort of like a maze (which I saw as a positive and a cool way to go around and see what the club has to offer). We were out in the dayclub area and noticed a few empty tables so our group decided to talk to a host and ended up getting set up with a table for the night and had an amazing time. We had a table outside for NIght Swim at XS the night before and the whole vibe, set up, seating was SO much better at Marquee. It was also sufficiently cheaper which I was surprised by. The DJ's in all rooms had the crowd going. In my opinion, right now Marquee is the club to beat in Las Vegas. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Oh Golden Steer, I totally have a crush on you! The Golden Steer is such a throwback to Old School Vegas. When you walk through the front door, you are transported back to the 1950s. Back in the 50s and 60s, this was THE place to go for a great steak dinner. When you are eating, you keep looking over your shoulder to see if Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr. had just walked in. It is just way too cool in my book. So back in the old days of Vegas, all of the Vegas Elite came here and had their own table. If you were anyone, you had a table with your name on it saving your seat. This is one of the cool leftovers from that era still in the restaurant. You can request to sit at Elvis', Marilyn Monroe, Dean Martin (my favorite Rat Packer, oh Dean-o I love you!), and numerous other celebrity tables. My mom is the biggest Elvis fan in the world, so when I took her here for her birthday last year and got the Elvis table, she almost cried. It is fun to have something fun in common with a superstar from yesteryear, in if it is just sitting at the same table at a great restaurant. On top of the coolness factor, the steaks speak for themselves too. I mean when the smallest steak on the menu is 12oz, you know you are in for a feast! Last time I was here, i ordered the Prime Rib and it came out on its own plate because there was no room for anything else on the plate. The Prime Rib was even hanging over the side in more than one place. I only made a small dent in it and ended up taking it home and it turned into 2 more meals at home. Now that is some serious MEAT. Yum and drool all at the same time. Another awesome aspect of this restaurant is the table side service for the desserts. This is one of the only places left in the world that does flaming Cherries Jubilee and Bananas Fosters at your table, flames and all. It is such a fun time watching your server make your dessert right there for you. And seriously, how doesn't like desserts on fire right in front of you? My absolute favorite part of this place is if you can go on a slow night when the owner is on property. The owner is this very nice lady who will make friends with you as soon as she meets you. I have been several times and she will always come by and just sit down with us at the table. She will tell you all sorts of stories about interesting things that has happened at the place. There are even some ghost stories about the place. And yes, weird stuff still happens there. BOO! Now that is a fun dinner to have, steaks and ghosts! So if you want to experience Old Vegas, eat a huge steak, have a flaming dessert, and maybe get spooked by a spook, this is your joint. Go check it out and support a local legend. ",0,0,0,1,0

 PCCR has been a great collaborator with our project. I attended a workshop on how to repurpose tote bags into new items. I was thrilled at how professional the staff were - the artist who led the workshop put a lot of time & energy into creating sample items AND developing a handout that we can use in the future. The attendees enjoyed the workshop, spent a lot of time exploring the store (and buying things) and we ended up with a great creative experience. PCCR is a tremendous asset. Some of our out of state donors are planning to come to Pgh just to visit the store and others send donations via mail. The staff are professional, flexible and very supportive of our collaboration. I enjoy walking into the store and it really does inspire me to try my hand at something new. I'm so pleased Pittsburgh has this resource. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I really hate to write a poor review of this yummy shabu shabu spot. If I could eliminate the last 30 minutes of our visit it would easily be a five star place. Ordered spicy crab roll ($5.50) and edamame ($3.50) to start. Unfortunately they didn't understand and brought it out with our kobe sukiyaki ($20.95) and kobe spicy miso broth shabu shabu ($20.95.) We barely had room on the table for everything but it was all awesome. Veggies plate was 60% cabbage, which was tasty, but I would have liked a few more carrots, broccoli and tofu. No free refills on veggies and rice as other places offer. But we had more than enough and it was all very good. At the end of our meal a party of 9 was sat. We asked for our check. It arrived 10 minutes later. Tried to pay immediately since I wanted to get home but the waitress rushed off to the big table. I get it, big table = big tip, but we just wanted to get outta there. Finally she arrives back and I hand her the check with a $30 Crowdsaving voucher and some cash. She says they don't take that, maybe the other Swish. I show her their address on it. She says she will find out. Doesn't ask anyone, we watch her serve the other table for 15 minutes. Then she returns and says they won't accept it. I don't point out that she never check, just insist I am right. Finally she agrees and takes it only to rush back excitedly to point out it says ONE PER CUSTOMER. I pointed out we only had one and she said ""but there are TWO of you!"" Very odd, esp since the bill was over $60 so it easily could have covered one of our meals. I explain this a she grudgingly added it to our check. Was a very frustrating experience, and it was not a language barrier, as she spoke English very well. We escaped almost 40 minutes after requesting our check. By then I was pissed and basically forgot about how delicious the meal was - horrible customer service can do that. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We gave them a year to fix their service issues and went back this week. We had a large party. Two of the people with us never got their food! I mean they NEVER got it after several complaints to the wait staff. Same thing happened a year ago! Their solutions is to bring watermelon shots none of us wanted. Seemed like an excuse. The manager finally came over, apologized and took money off the bill. However when we left with our two hungry friends I let him know that this happened last time and we stayed away for a year. He said "" Well Ma'am if the same thing keeps happening I would just never come back!"" No joke! The manager said that about his establishment.

 I would never recommend Chuck E Cheese at 7381 Lake Mead, Las Vegas NV. I just had my son's birthday party at Chuck E Cheese and it was so disorganized. I hope that my guests did not realize it. The party hostess was friendly at first, she got our orders for the kids pizza and adult pizzas. She said, okay i have that you are having 14 kids. I looked at her with a startled expression and said, no I am having 20 kids. She looked at the plates on the table and was like ""oh I guess I could of looked at all those plates"". I was like, what have I got myself into. There were clearly 20 plates on the table, but she didn't have the correct information. I never saw the party hostess around until the manager saw me getting my own pitchers and I asked for more plates. I had to fill up my own pitchers after they were empty. The tables weren't cleaned off to the very end. I was surprised the cake was ready for the ""Big Chuck E Cheese"" show. The other ""party host / hostess"" seemed more attentive to their guests vs. my party hostess. I am not sure if she just didn't care or if she was overwhelmed with the 20 + kids we had. I have had my kid's birthday parties at other facilities (Child's Play, Laser Tag, Sky zone etc) and those experiences were wonderful. The other party host at (Child's Play, Laser Tag, Sky zone, etc) were always around or if they needed to go on break there was always someone else around. Another thing was the ""ticket blaster"", she never explained the ticket blaster, that my son FINALLY went in. She said, oh did he already do the ticket blaster and I was like no I was waiting for you. She said, oh that (and she pointed) party host is doing the ticket blaster. By that time, I just gave up on the party host. I took my son to the other hostess who was wonderful. i always give a $50.00 tip to my party hostess/host but she received a $10.00. I don't even think she deserved that. The only thing she seemed to be on top of was handing me the bill. I would never recommend Chuck E Cheese on Lake Mead in La's Vegas. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I've had the opportunity to try this Firehouse Subs location twice and was definitely impressed the first time, and just slightly less impressed during my second visit. I have fallen in love with their Firehouse Hero, but I make a few little changes. Both times I have ordered this sandwich online and it was PERFECT. Tonight I ordered a sandwich in person and the girl taking my order LITERALLY had to ask me to repeat EVERYTHING for my order....and it came out wrong. It wasn't drastically wrong, so I didn't call to complain after I got home, but I will stick to placing orders online from now on. Less trouble and they seem to pay more attention. The inside of the store is clean and they have an awesome Coke fountain machine that lets you customize just about anything you want to drink - a HUGE plus, but I still go to Sonic (across the street!) for my drinks. The other reason for the missing star? The artwork depicting a LVFD fireman turning the hose full blast on a coyote chasing a rabbit.

 After our previous experience we decided to give Loch Fyne another go - to hopefully amend the previous review. I have to say, again, we weren't super impressed. We arrived and were first asked if we had a voucher. All that really made us think was - we were obviously missing a trick and paying too much if there were vouchers out there somewhere! We then sat at our table for 20 minutes without anyone speaking to us and we had to walk up to the manager and ask for someone to come take our order. Even once they arrived, we weren't told about the specials or any other specifics. I had the seafood platter - while I thought it was small when it arrived - it was plenty to fill me up. The fish was cooked well and the King Prawn was enjoyable. My OH had the Steak and King Prawns, which was slightly overcooked but enjoyable. The chips with weren't the best and were warm, which means they got cold rather quickly. To their credit, once we brought to their attention that we would like to be served, they apologised a few times, checked on us regularly and ensured we were taken care of. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Located in Duquesne Heights, you must visit this restaurant. If for nothing else, just the night time view of downtown Pittsburgh. It was wonderful. There is an upper and a lower level to this restaurant. The upper-level is fairly pretentious and filled with lots of glitz and suits. The lower-level is where the bar is located and it contains a small amount of window seating. Many people go to sit upstairs. Why? I don't know. It is so bright and contrived and you cannot get a very good view. I prefer the darker lower level where people are more down to earth and real and the fact that you can actually see the city lit up at night. Don't let the coat check fool you. If you feel uncomfortable, just head to the lower level. We were greeted by our server and handed the menus. We were able to look through and asked our server for her suggestions. We placed our order for the recommended appetizer that was not on the menu: Combo Platter: Ichiban (tuna, salmon, and swordfish grilled on a skewer), Crabcake, and Cajun shrimp I was continually distracted by the view. You can see the Duquesne Incline, the Southside, Downtown and the Northside and it is amazing how the night coupled with lit buildings can create such a sublime and dramatic image on the horizon -- Beautiful. I had to focus, though, and was ready for our server when she returned with the appetizer: French onion soup Butternut squash soup Mahi mahi with garlic- feta mashed potatoes Yellow fin tuna with, garlic-feta mashed potatoes, and tomatoes with balsamic vinaigrette The tri-partite appetizer combined three of the more popular appetizers on the written menu. I was quite glad they had this option tonight since I would have been very disappointed to have ordered the Ichiban and the Cajun shrimp as their own dish. Both were not great and were lacking in flavor. The fish cubes on the Ichiban skewer were somewhat tough and overcooked with very little flavor. The shrimp were slightly rubbery and did not taste Cajun. The price of this appetizer was only $1 more than the crab cake appetizer. The crab cake was quite good. It is the best crab cake I have had in the Pittsburgh area. It was well cooked, moist, tasted of lump crab and had minimal filler. As we were finishing the appetizer the soups and tomatoes appeared. My butternut squash soup came in a two-part series to preserve the scant heat in the soup itself and to protect the crab that came at the bottom of my bowl. The soup was poured over the seeds and crab at the table. It tasted very good, but unfortunately it cooled rather quickly -- this is on of the issues with Creme Fraiche, you cannot over heat or it will curdle. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor of the squash in the smooth soup coupled with the fresh crab, pumpkin seed, and creme fraiche. The French Onion soup had a good flavor. Not over-seasoned, the onions were actually cooked, and a good consomme as its base. Our dinners arrived and I was surprised by the size. The portions were quite large for both entrees and one could have easily been split between two people. A bit apprehensive after the Ichiban, I tried the tuna to find that the flavor was much better for the entree. The same held true for the mahi-mahi. The tuna was cooked to a nice medium rare, had good texture and flavor and was not filled with gristle. The mahi-mahi was tender, moist, and flavorful. The blackening seasoning had a good flavor and was mildly piquant. I moved on to the mashed potatoes and my tomatoes. There was just a hint of the feta and garlic in the potatoes that complimented the potatoes very well. The tomatoes were good and the vinaigrette was also tasty. I do wish that they would have used a better oil and vinegar, though. The oil was a cheaper brand without much flavor and the balsamic was fairly weak, but with good flavor. Unable to finish our meals, we decided that we wouldn't bother with desserts. Next time -- and there will be a next time -- the appetizer will be crab cake only and we will be splitting a meal. With more than enough food for two, this will also cut the bill considerably. I will continue to sit on the lower level and I hope that I get our server again. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Wow. Worst dining experience I've had since a little buffet in Louisiana. Terrible old and dingy decor. Our seats and tables were basically hosed down. It was all wet from someone ""cleaning"" it. The buffet was scary and I thought I may get food poisoning, so I stayed away from all mayonnaise concoctions. Prime rib was a dark brown - totally overcooked. The condiments for baked potatoes were set-up before the utensils, not after the baked potatoes - so I had to go in reverse in the buffet. Most of the selections were meat. The salad bar, ugh...The vanilla ice cream was out and there was an array of drip bowls for dripping machine. The shrimp were a strange orangey brown color and cocktail sauce was drizzled all over the bar. There was a mess of serving spoons everywhere. The chicken was good. But I picked a hair out of it. not even a decent dessert could appear here. My silverware was sticky to start. The chocolate cake tasted like a recycled HoHo. The whole experience was simply awful. At $36.00 for two people, it's not even a deal. I am convinced all the other buffets on town ship their week old leftovers here to serve. I feel bad for posting this because some of the servers were very sweet people and I can't imagine having to show up here everyday. OMG. Just an awful experience. * after reading some of these 3 - 4 - 5 star reviews, I'm really worried for some of my fellow Yelpers. This place is dangerous.

 I work nearby so I was hoping for the best. Uncomfortable bench seating. Bizarre order at the front protocol. The place smelled like old people and looked dirty and unkempt so I knew off the bat that I wouldn't order any raw fish. If I could give zero stars, I would. The shrimp tempura roll was somehow gross due to the rice not being cooked right and the crab tasting fishy. Yech The Pad Thai was downright DISGUSTING. I'm Not sure why. Too much fish sauce? COLD TOFU on top that exploded with cold water when you take a bite. (SO freaking gross.). The shrimp tasted freezer burned. I didn't eat it and they didn't charge me thank god. Oh boy.

 Really, it's a 2.5 but I rounded up. It's fine, but it's upscale bar food and the hype really raised my expectations. I have to start with the no credit card thing - I typically avoid those places like the plague - it's the cost of doing business, you should absorb the cost rather than passing on the hassle to your customers. But, the place is jammed so clearly enough people don't mind. I was told the beer selection was the best in town - um, no it's not. It's fine, a really nice selection, but it's not the best in town by far. I had the Houseboat, chicken sandwich brined and blackened with a habanero basil mayo, really nice. But the fries were pretty greasy. My wife had the fish fry, really loved it and opted for the wasabi green beans, good option. But, really nothing beyond A-OK for me, and the no credit card thing makes Weary Traveler my standout preference. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Discriminated Against the Disabled. Arrived in Tempe last night for the Cactus Bowl - our first trip to Tempe. Wandered down Mill Ave to find someplace for dinner. Saw Zipps and thought it looked good. We walked in there with my medical alert service dog. I am disabled but my disability is not obvious. The dog is clearly identified as a service dog with a vest and leash. The Security guy at the host podium took one look at the dog and said ""my manager is going to prefer if you guys sit outside with the dog."" Keep in mind that Tempe is having an unusual cold snap and it was 38 degrees outside. I told him that it was illegal to discriminate against the disabled or segregate us at all. He just stared at me. We chose to leave as we don't want to give our business to a company that is so unwelcoming to the disabled. ",1,0,0,0,0

Having stayed at a Baymont in Traverse City and Macinaw City in the past month - both of which were wonderful (except the breakfast) - I was stunned when I pulled up to this ramshackle motel. Just from the outside it appeared to be the poster child for the seedy. What a dump! Here's what's worse. Spoke with 'Eric' three times the day prior to our scheduled stay and was constantly assured a first floor suite would be no problem. (My wife is handicapped). We show up and are told that there are no first floor rooms available despite previous assurances otherwise. We roll with the punch and ask for a second floor room near the elevator. Guess what? There IS NO ELEVATOR. The lone bright spot is they cancelled our reservation on the spot (they'd better not charge me - they said they wouldn't). Thanks to 'Roger' for doing that. Sure wish I had researched the hotel with Yelp prior. I won't repeat that mistake. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This Baja Fresh really didn't impress me. It's pricey considering that all you're getting is meat in a tortilla. It doesn't have that Mexican feel to it and is unoriginal. There were bugs on the wall. The food is good however. Nothing special though. Since it's a corporate chain you can't expect sizzling flavor but I was left unsatisfied. There are better Mexican food places to go to. ",0,1,0,0,0

 If you get the chicken club you're okay otherwise stay away from pretty much anything else but the salads. We were there tonight and got the food in a somewhat timely fashion the waitress hostess however would not seat us until our entire party of 12 arrived otherwise she would in ""get in trouble"" Which was ridiculous so we had to wait around and not able to sit down. Then, one person in our party didn't get her chicken sandwich until about 10 minutes later and then got charged an extra dollar for it to be blackened but it wasn't blackened and the manager told her no when she tried to take the dollar off how crazy is that? I can't believe this place has been around so long and is still in business with such poor management. Unfortunately this is the only restaurant on the lake and they know it. Such a shame they should really get their act together. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm finally getting around to reviewing this place, and I've been at least 3 times. I hesitated for a split second in giving it 4-stars, but I am indeed a fan (though not for its flavor, which is what reviews are usually based on). The line is usually pretty long, which can be a major turn-off if you're in a hurry. But the service is prompt, and prices are not bad at ~$6/sandwich. I'm no sandwich connoisseur, but the bread is warm and chewy (with a crispy crust), and the flavor is good. It's not spectacular, but it's a solid. For its convenience at the Miracle Mile shops, connected to Planet Hollywood, and across from Cosmopolitan, it is my go-to spot for a sandwich. Plus, the people watching can be good as lotsa people hit up this place... ",0,0,0,1,0

 We read all the reviews, were in the area so we thought we'd try it. We started with the breaded panko mozzarella. It was very thick so that the cheese did not completely melt. Pretty bland with little flavor. The marinara was good though. I ordered the sliders since I read so many good reviews on them and my husband ordered the lasagna. Our salad was all lettuce and four little diced tomatoes in the corners. The dressing was flavorful but I would have liked some Parmesan or something. Our meals came and the lasagna was lukewarm. We sent it back to the kitchen and it came back a few minutes later... Same piece of lasagna. They must have microwaved it which is completely tacky. Sauce was bland and it was mostly cheese. My sliders were also disappointing. All I could taste was the burned charcoal flavor of the inside of the bread. The server was wonderful however. She was super attentive, apologetic about the lukewarm meal, and quick to refill our drinks. Of course, there were only 2 other parties in the restaurant. Overall, food was bland and lukewarm, and my husband's rating is Blech. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Overall I would give this Target a 3.49/5 so for review purposes have to round down to 3. This location is usually pretty clean and organized. Staff are usually pretty helpful but there are often times when they are no where to be found. Cashiers could be improved, most of the time the lines are a tad bit long and slow. The location is good as it is next to a large variety of stores. Overall a decent location/store. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Aldi is the best!! First of all, I love this location. Right across from the southside works and right next to my favorite two coffee shops and the goodwill... My work and school are in close proximity too, making it my most visited grocery store! The parking lot has never been an issue for me in any way. You cannot beat the prices in Aldi... You just can't! $1 avocados, all the time?! You pay double that at giant eagle. I do wish they sold spinach though- last time I bought their romaine lettuce, it did not last more than two days. Simply nature is their organic, all natural line and it's awesome. I've bought their organic pasta sauce (and LOVE it, even more than trader joes ! :x), quinoa and agave... And love them all. Not only are they delicious but they would all cost double at giant eagle. Their organic pasta sauce is delicious and I can pronounce everything on the ingredients list. I used to love Trader Joes organic pasta sauce, until I discovered their was milk in it (why would you need milk in marinara?!) .. I found Aldi's brand to be cheaper and just overall more tasty and healthy! I also love their weekly specials on products for your home. I recently purchased a pack of three various sized cookie sheets for only $9. You would pay double that at Marshall's! I also recently purchased a pack of three various sized baking pans for $9 too, again, the price cannot be beat. Both high quality products as well! The only item that I have tried from Aldi that I really would not recommend is their almond milk.. I found it to be quite watery and overall tasteless. Aldi is awesome! Bring your own grocery bags when planning a visit! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Wow, people are really hard on this restaurant as if they were authentic thai chefs themselves...just kidding! I've recently become a really big fan of thai food, although I've been a HUGE fan of pad thai for quite some years now. After seeing that the Lotus of Siam was on the food network, I knew I had to give it a try. I've been there about 4 or 5 times now and have been satisfied every time. I mean, it wasn't THE best thai I've had, but I can see why everyone's raving about it. Next time, try to be a little brave and order a little something from each category and try it out...you won't be sorry. I started talking to the waitress and she said that the reason why the food was so fresh is that they make a trip to LA TWICE a week to get fresh ingredients for their dishes. TWICE A WEEK! If that's not passion, I don't know what is. ",0,0,0,0,1

 You can't compare Monta and Sora. They are two different beasts. Me? I'm a Sora fan. I love getting the chasu ramen with miso broth and extra noodles. The Sapporo style ramen noodle is slightly thick, curly and complements the fatty broth well. Since the noodles are slightly curly more of the broth coats the noodle. This makes for a fun splurpfest. If you come on a weeknight or after 6:40pm, be prepared to wait 20 minutes. ",0,0,0,1,0

 It was cute. Like Knott's Berry Farm before they added the rides. We were there during a Chile Cook Off so it was crowded. I understand that this is not usually the case. I took my in-laws who were wintering in Apache Junction and had never even heard of the place. So maybe they need to do a little better at promoting the place. If it weren't for Yelp I would never have found it. Thank you Fellow Yelpers! I didn't do the train ride mainly because of the reviews on here. The buggy rides were shut down due to the contest, but the lady that runs them is super sweet and the horses looked well cared for. Her husband is an author that was signing books in front of the museum. He has done tons of research on the local area so they are great fonts of knowledge and quite entertaining. I bought my mom his book and she just loved it. (Crooked Mountain by Ron Feldman). I didn't read all of the reviews for the businesses there, so a word of warning, don't eat at the saloon. It was just terrible. Both the food and the service. As stated before, very cute, family oriented place. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Par for a flying experience Had not flown USAir in a long time, but they had the lowest fair since I was going carry-on only for a quick work trip. Staff was nice on the check-in side and asked me if I wanted to check my bag for $25. I said ""no thanks"" and he let me know that was the best choice as my flight would be on a smaller regional jet with limited bag space. He went on to share that they would courtesy check my bag at the gate for free to manage the space limits. Good to know! Attendants at the gate and on the flight were all friendly. It was tighter than a 737... a rare time where I'm glad I'm not 6'. Not a huge fan of how they do boarding groups, as well. But that is the standard these days and they are just part of the pack. I'd fly again so long as I do the no-checked-baggage thing, again. I hate the idea of paying $25 for my one average suitcase. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I was here for the opening night, and I've returned semi-regularly ever since. The beer selection is satisfying, the layout of the bar is great (with both indoor and outdoor options), and the staff are generally very friendly and helpful. Yes, the beer is overpriced (a pint is not a pint here, I'm afraid), but I tend to overlook that. There is one thing, however, that is quite impossible to overlook. TURN DOWN THE MUSIC. Not just a little bit. Down by half, please. It is simply not possible to have a conversation without getting hoarse. Last night I brought a decently large group here. We spent around $150 in a fairly short period of time, and would have spent another $150 IF WE COULD HAVE CARRIED ON A CONVERSATION WITHOUT SHOUTING. We asked various members of staff repeatedly if they could please turn down the music, and we got the same (very sympathetic) response every time: ""we all agree that the music is way too loud, but the owner keeps coming in and cranking up the volume."" So we left, walked down to Tops, and spent our $150 there. Some people have tried to apologize for the stultifying volume of the music at this place by pointing out that the bar is catering to a college-age crowd. WE were both (a) COLLEGE-AGE and (b) a CROWD, and the volume of your music drove us and our money right out the door. Owner-Person: you are patently nuts. We understand. But you would do well to listen to your customers, and your very friendly staff. In fact, you should listen very attentively to your staff, since they're the ones that will soon be filing claims with OSHA concerning their hearing-loss. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I was excited to see a new home-cooking restaurant open in S. Chandler, as we need something that is affordable and not a chain. This restaurant is in the old Native New Yorker spot in the Safeway center. I first ordered the chicken pot pie, which was marked as a specialty, but I was informed that ""they weren't serving that yet."" Instead I selected the chicken fried steak. The portions were large, but the meat patties were frozen, not fresh, and had some weird seasoning that I didn't care for. I would say it's on par with Denny's, and not something I was happy paying $9.50 for. For dessert I selected the French Silk pie, which they were also out of. The German chocolate pie had a beautiful meringue top and was very good. I'd go back for a slice of pie, but won't be eating a meal there again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 What can I say, I *knew* this place was a dive bar before I decided to eat there so I don't know why I was so annoyed the duration of my stay. I got carded at the door. I'm in my mid 30s, so I did not mind this at all. The only thing is as soon as I get carded, I know I'm probably headed into a bar full of people I could have babysat. Not the case. The patrons in the bar gave me the sense that this bar is where 'dreams go to die."" There was just something sad about the vibe. I think it was the fact it was noon on a weekday and there were all these senior citizens at the bar. No one was talking, and no one looked happy, and this may have been bc there wasn't a game on tv. I dunno. We sat outside on the deck. the atmosphere was as nice as atmosphere can be when you're sitting next to a major intersection and trucks are going by. There were some potted plants, so that helped. And the deck is screened in, so it helped keep road debris out. Our waitress looked like she'd been crying. I felt really bad for her, and my friend asked me if we were in the 'twilight zone.' this is when we made some hard decisions. Do we leave, or do we just get shit faced drunk bc, you know, we're already here and all... We stayed and got drunk, and ordered chicken strips. They have a good variety of beers available and they're reasonably priced. We were wasted. Then we asked if we could order food, and the waitress reminded us we'd alreayd ordered food. This was an hour and a half later. There's very little I care about when drunk so I asked, ""Well, what's the status of the basket of chicken strips?"" The waitress teared up again and siad there was a 'melt down in the kitchen' and that she would 'do what she could' for us. Clearly there was also a melt down in the dining room. Then, some random dude vomited right outside the bar, basically right in front of us. This is when we left. Given the ridic nature of my visit there, I am certain this had to be a very off night. I'd urge you to go there and tip the waitress with the peach hair veyr, very well. She's apparently going through a lot right now. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My partner and I were getting ready to start our Sunday Funday drinking at BS West on 7/28/13 and we decided it might be a good idea to eat first seeing as we haven't eaten all day. CBCB is within walking distance from the club so we decided we'd check it out. We were greeted at the door and were taken to a booth. There were many different sporting events on the televisions. I was pleased to see that they were showing the soccer game, with a lot of soccer fans in attendance at CBCB. It was USA vs. Portugal, which we won 1-0, WOOT WOOT! But the server was nice and brought us waters right away. Every person that was working there looked to be in good moods and they were an attractive bunch of guys and gals! The menu tells you everything you need to know about the food and prices, including any extra charges for substitutions. I ordered the mac and cheese burger and my partner ordered the glazed doughnut burger. It was REAL mac and cheese too, not that crap from a box with the powdered cheese. When the food arrived, which was pretty quick, one bite into the hamburger and my life was changed. There's a reason why the burgers are a little on the pricy side; you're paying for quality. It was AMAZING! My partner couldn't even talk as his brain was on another planet after eating his hamburger. The tots and fries were good too. CBCB saved our lives as we didn't get too trashed when we went back to the club as we were stuffed the rest of the day. Thanks CBCB, we will definitely be returning with others from the bar. Keep up the great work and the great food. ",0,0,0,0,1

 First off I joined the University Area gym but I can't find a page for it but it's still the same organization. When I got in there to check out the payment option they began to preach how everything was geared towards students and how we could freeze our membership at anytime. Also if we chose to pay the huge joining fee (ridiculous compared to other gyms I've been too) we didn't have to be in a contract and could cancel our membership ANYTIME we wanted to. Well I moved back home for the summer and no longer needed my membership so I call to have it canceled. This is where the fun began I was sent on a mission just to get a chance to cancel, I was told I couldn't cancel through the gym unless I came up there apparently they wanted to try to talk me out of it. Next I was given a number to call and after taking forever to get to what I was after I was told I had to send an email for consideration. CONSIDERATION I paid the extra money to not have a contract so I could cancel at ANYTIME. Well they considered it and I could cancel but not immediately I had to pay another month worth to be able to cancel when I'm no longer in town. I am EXTREMELY unhappy with my experience with this gym which was completely overpacked Monday through Wednesday and apparently everyone lost interest by Thursday. I wouldn't recommend this gym to anyone especially now that it's under new management and the joining fees and monthly prices have went up even more. Terrible gym there much better gyms around for much more reasonable prices. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My wife wanted to go because she has been craving a blooming onion for, well, a long time. We finally went for lunch. We started out sitting in the bar but couldn't get service so asked to be moved to the dinning room. She was serving all of the people at the bar as well as every table in the bar area. Not sure if this was due to greed or poor management. Anyway we ordered the blooming onion that my wife had been craving. This was the worst onion I had ever had. I will admit, it's not like I have eaten at several Outback's, but from what I do remember, they were awesome. The one we had was soaked with grease, almost like it had been sitting there for awhile. It actually gave me an upset stomach for several hours after. My wife had the chicken strips (if you have read any of my other posts, you may see a trend) and I had the fish tacos. Both were ok and that's about it. It is typical chain food. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Waited for our pizza for 2 hours.

We were told they would credit the money back to us and they would just void the order. Pretty upset that we would not receive the pizza either, 10 minutes later the driver knocks on the door at this time his phone rings and he was told they credited us our money back so just to bring the pizza back. So upset at this point the drivers leaves with the pizza lol I called the store back and said what the hell your here why not just give us the piZza since we waited so long and he's actually here and your just going to throw it away the lady responds ok you can have pizza on us and she would call the driver back to bring it to us???

 Came in late because there is no other 24 hour Italian place I know of. I had the fettucini alfredo with chicken, house salad, and an iced tea for about 25 bucks. Not a bad deal, not the best one either. The sauce could have been cheesier, the chicken, more flavorful. In fact, my buddy claims it's canned and microwaved chicken; i'd say i dont have enough evidence to say for sure. Hey, Italy's got cans and microwaves anyhow, right? I've also had the chicken Carmine here before, not too shabby either. A nice pasta dish that is a change up from standard cream or marinara sauce. If you're coming in late, you'll have to sit at the bar which is not a good idea if you are allergic to cigarette smoke or wannabe experts in surfing/karate. I've been in the dining room before, the service is polite, although slow if it's late. My meals here are never particularly memorable, not necessarily a bad thing. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Pop in for a quick bit after a 14 hour Grand Canyon bus tour around 10pm Monday night. This place was packed... Ordered 7 items including 1/2 carafe of Sangria, bill came to $120 before tips.

Can't really taste the fois gras, taste like salted potatoes added to the pork. OK, not terrific Rossejat...angel hair pasta pealla with prawns. This is my favorite dish. It's like angel hair pasta that's been cooked with prawn soup base. A steal @ $15Yummy for my tummy. For dessert we had the flan. Very smooth texture.

 Never again. Straight up, you can cook better food at home I promise. Even if that means making a cup of ramen. Yes. Unfortunate. The food is bland, lackluster and there's just no love. They don't seem to care about what's on the plate. I'm pretty sure my salad was one of those premixed deals from a plastic bag. The homemade lox was okay. Honestly, it was pretty tasteless and forgettable. Ah, this is so harsh! The place was busy so it was likely an area favourite but this could also be because there's not much choice around. Otherwise, the interior is cute and quaint. There's a TV on the wall playing local television. Dear management, get rid of that. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This was a very easy 5 stars to give! The food here was incredible! I went with a small group of friends and we shared 2 starters and 5 mains between us and each one was absolutely delicious!! The food feels very authentic and the flavours are genuinely magnificent. To begin with we had satay and roti with a spicy dip that all of us agreed we would happily drink as soup it was so scrummy! For the mains we had crispy shredding beef, two duck dishes, a squid and a chicken - each one very different but very tasty! The portions were sizeable (perfect for sharing) and the service was quick and friendly. The restaurant was buzzing too, so the atmosphere was great! In terms of pricing, though this place isn't cheap, it's also not expensive, with mains falling around the \ u00a39 mark in general. As far as Malaysian cuisine goes this felt very authentic and was really very tasty!Absolutely worth a visit if you're ever in Edinburgh! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was on a thrift store junket the other day - hitting about 6 different stores in a single afternoon. Although this store is the closest to my house, in the 8 years I've lived in Vegas, I think I've only bought one thing here - granted that was a super sweet 1960s ""Las Vegas Story"" souvenir 45 rpm record with uber-cool graphics. That said though, this teeny Goodwill is jam packed with cast off clothing from the 1990s - nothing particularly cool or vintage. The shelved items are generally in disarray and the store seems particularly, um, fragrant and stuffy. I'll stop in maybe once or twice a year, but I generally don't enjoy shopping at this location.

 In keeping with my practice of ""One Visit for a NOT so good Review"" and ""Multiple visits for a GOOD Review,"" I wish I could give this well appointed Restaurant a better Review. The service was terrific, with a knowledgeable Server, but unfortunately the food left a lot to be desired. My salad was well dressed, although it could have had a few more ingredients (Romaine Lettuce and a single lonely cherry tomato) and my Shrimp Pasta had only three, relatively small forlorn shrimp atop some very nicely done Pasta, with an unremarkable sauce. VERY disappointing. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Gone to a few of these foot spas back in California, and I generally like them a lot. Came here with my husband for nice relaxing massage after two nights of nonstop dancing at the clubs. Ended up getting one of the most painful massages. The guy masseur seemed to be using all of his strength. After a while he asked if the pressure was ok. By that point he had eased up a bit so I said it was ok. Right after that he ended up adding more and more pressure until it was so painful. At the end of the massage he hit his hands so hard on me, supposedly to loosen out any last knots, and I felt like I was getting a beating. With so many other foot spas on the same street, I don't think we'll be coming back here again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Can I steal Marcy and bring her to San Diego? Pretty pretty please? I've patronized so many eyebrows threading salons in both Las Vegas and San Diego and Fabulous Eyebrow Threading reigns supreme over all of them. Marcy truly turns eyebrow threading into an art form. She is meticulous and has an uncanny ability to shape eyebrows so that they complement your face shape perfectly. I make a point to visit her every time I visit Vegas and always come out a satisfied customer. Best of all she always remembers me and makes me feel welcome. The price for eyebrows ($10) is also very competitive and a bargain considering Marcy's skills. ",0,0,0,0,1

 READ THIS REVIEW: Based off the reviews here on yelp, Grimaldi's Is terrible. The pizzeria itself doesn't look bad, but the service and pizza are sub par. I think there were about 5 tables in the entire restaurant, and yet it took 40 minutes for us to receive our food. I got the traditional with Italian sausage and onions. The sausage tasted like sausage from pizza hut. Good pizza should not fall apart when i'm eating it. Overall, the pizza was just bland with nothing exciting about it. At the end, the server charged me 5 dollars more than our total bill, and when I asked her about it, she said she didn't remember and just handed me 5 dollars from someone else's check. Very unprofessional. I was in vegas looking for a good place to eat and this place received 4.5 stars. Why. There is nothing 4 stars about this place. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Needs some fine tuning. I was impressed with the attentiveness of the service, as I ate a meal here and then moved to another table outside to drink a beer and catch the Suns game on another one of the flatscreens. The person I ordered from even found me and asked if I needed another beer... perfect. Paying up was a little awkward since I couldn't remember who my server was (although the person who took my order was doing double-duty as the bartender and was apparently indisposed when I went to pay). Either way, I got the impression that the staff here really cares and even covers for one another without hesitation to make sure the customers stay happy. Seems like a decent enough place to go to watch sports on the tube as the bar has several monitors all over the place (including outside on the patio, as I mentioned). The clientele seemed pretty friendly. I wasn't impressed with the food, however. I ordered a western burger, which should've been straightforward enough. The cook brought out the onion rings that were supposed to be on the burger separately, after realizing his mistake in omitting them. I'm glad he followed up and corrected the oversight, but the burger just wasn't tasty. Perhaps some seasoning issues need to be addressed to get the basic burger plate up to par. I'll probably stop by again and catch a game and a beer here sometime. But I'm not ordering the burger again. Hopefully, the rest of the menu fares better. ",0,0,1,0,0

 It was my first time going this past weekend. The line was really long, but we had some passes to get in front or whatever. It was alright I guess....I expected more, but really nothing spectacular. Drinks weren't too expensive....but music was bad. There were a lot of old people there, so it was kinda disgusting having them grind in front of me. Maybe if I was drunk I would've had more fun? Oh, and the VIP area is pretty small and just not very ""VIP-ish"" But I have to say the host at the door was really nice. I forgot his name, but he said he'd hook us up to get into Pure....we didn't wind up going to Pure but it was still really nice of him to offer :) ",0,1,0,0,0

 First impressions are great in their first hour of business. Super cool, totally radical atmosphere, dude. Very Pacific Beach style motif. Walls adorned with surf and skate gear photos and lamps. Lots of surf gear sponsorship hung around in here. Ordered a spicy and mild fish taco and both were equally flavorful and delicious. Brown rice was done right and their Cajun beans were not bad at all. Of course everything was kicked up a notch when I squeezed my lime wedge on everything. Everything came as expected and enjoyed my meal in the outdoor seating area. Look forward to come back in the near future and patronize their full service bar.

 This was a 1st time try at the new restaurant off FLW in Scottsdale. Angie my wife and I have been waiting for it to open up to see how it compares to the BBQ food experience we had in Texas (great BBQ in Texas) Confused as to exactly what to order (no real illustrations in the menu) I thought we might try the Lunch BBQ plate combo, so we did. I'm not a big fan of BBQ chicken as I am very particular on how the skin is cooked and we were both disappointed that the platter only comes with dark chicken meat. The pulled pork meat and Brisket were excellent, The brisket was so tender you could cut it with a fork but still firm enough to be brisket. The brisket slices were also not too thick but not paper thin. The sauce was for me just a little on the runny side, but the flavor was excellent. So, it's not my favorite BBQ joint, but it still needs time to grow and perfect it's menu in order to make it unique enough to remain in Scottsdale. Only time will tell... ",0,0,1,0,0

 Poor customer service My friends and I have been looking for a great place to make it our spot. We have been to many places and we found this place, first time I got into it with a nail tech after politely telling them four times how I wanted the design and also showing her a photo. Second time was nice and they do a nice job so I made an appointment for me and two of my friends at five pm. My friends arrived before me and were told that we didnt have an appointment, my friend called me and told me, I told her who I spoke with and my friend again told the nail tech we had an appointment. The tech said "" like I told you, you'll have to wait, we didn't write it down"". Needless to say after now two issues we did not wait and we will not go back! They do great nails if you can handle the attitude ",1,0,0,0,0

 A friend and I tried here the other day and i wasn't impressed. I thought it was too dark and the service was all out of whack especially considering the fact that the place was practically empty. The hostess and the runner seemed to be frenimies and it was a lil ackward! We sat down and looked at the unnecessarily complicated menu... nothing really outstanding. The usual overprices Japanese-y selection with the occasional hit of Hawaiian... but it was just Americanized Japanese cuisine. I've had Hawaiian food, its wonderful... what the heck was this? The people there kept giving us the once over and threw their nose in the air... just to get a lil revenge, we put our Louis Vuitton and Tiffany bags on the table and went over our recent purchases (those reviews coming soon!) and the looks of snobby angst turned to jealously like THAT! lol... I could see this attitude if it were some high priced exclusive resturant that required a jacket for dinner serivce... but a freakin' wanna-be Hawaiian that's in a MALL?!? Are you serious?! Ugh Scottsdale! *eye roll* I had the rainbow roll and the dumplings, they were good, decent. No serious complaints, but still not great and stellar. I don't think I'll go back and sit in the resturant. I think I'll go to my local sushi place down the way from my place. Same food, same quality, different price! To my yelpers I say: skip it, you're not missing much... and though it may be Scottsdale, do you REALLY expect to find a good meal at a freakin' mall?? ",0,1,0,0,0

 I am not a fan of Kona Grill and it really baffles me as to why this place is always so packed. They do have a lot of items on their menu that sound great but I feel like the quality of the food is very hit or miss. The same with the service from the waitstaff in the dining area. The bartenders can definitely mix up some good cocktails and they have a great patio but the sushi they serve at Happy Hour is awful - not well prepared and tastes like it has been sitting out for a while. I guess out of the choices available nearby it is not a bad place in comparison. I would definitely rather go here than Cheescake Factory or that new Old Spaghetti Factory (horrible!) but there are a lot better places out there once you escape the confines of the mall.

 Great restaurant if you are in the mood for fresh and healthy style Mexican food and do not want to pay extra money to be waited on hand and foot. I am from California, and the closest thing I can compare it to would be Baja Fresh, but Blue Burrito has a full service bar which is a really nice addition. The only negative thing I noticed was the mini taco soft shells. They are about the diameter of an orange which is a little strange. They do provide an unlimited supply of chips and salsa so that helps. The burritos are large. Everything seems very fresh and they don't use lard of other unhealthy additives. They need to open one of these in L.A.. I would go there all the time. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I mainly chose This buffet because I had free tickets for Mac King, which wasn't free because you have to spend 10 on drinks. Anywho the show was Good. And we got the Vip, which includes BOGO half price buffet. Now I saw They had hot crab, so I immediately attack. It was bomb. Only problem I have is the waiter, he seems to be all in it for the tips. And seems like he pays more attention to the white folks than the minorities. I had to ask for refills twice, when he passed by quite a lot and saw we had empty cups. But when he saw he had tips at a table, he jumped right on it. But he won't get a tip from me. (Waiter Dwayne ) ",0,0,1,0,0

 I really don't like giving lower star ratings, but wow...sometimes it just can't be helped. Pasta Cucina here at the Texas Station was in a word, underwhelming. After being seated I just wasn't even close to impressed. I should have known something was up because on a Friday night the place was near empty, with maybe only 4-5 tables being occupied at the time. Spider-Sense failed me! The place was set nicely with great ambience and warmth. But none of this was used to the restaurant's advantage. After being seated by the friendly manager we proceeded to wait...and wait. My lady and I did hear some light arguing in the back of the house involving why the couple that just came in (us) was seated at our particular table. Seems our waiter was hoping it would stay empty until closing so he could promptly leave right when the restaurant closed. I being a good sport disregarded hearing this to try and give him a chance. I know the feeling of wanting to go home after a long day at work. We waited for nearly 20 minutes before our waiter came out to greet us, with me pretending we didn't hear him talking about us prior. He gave us a wine list (which was average at best) but we passed on it and asked for an ice water and iced tea. Again, we waited. About 15 minutes later we received our drinks and the menus. Strike one! The real reason we decided to try here was because Station Casinos was touting Pasta Cucina's 2 for $20 menu, with 11 entrees to choose from. I would have never gone to this place otherwise to give it a shot. So call me surprised when we receive our menus there is no 2 for $20 option to be found. I inquire about this and I get a look from the waiter as if I'm a cheapskate. I am, but there's no need to be rude to me! Our waiter takes the regular menus from us and replaces them with a smaller one that has the 2 for $20 entree specials on it. Funny thing is that because the entrees were on the cheaper side we wanted to order something from the appetizer section of the regular menu to treat ourselves. Our waiter didn't even bother asking if we still wanted to see the regular menu. The smart thing to do would have been to bring out BOTH the regular and 2 for $20 menu and let us choose. This guy thought we were foolish and wouldn't even know they were running specials. Hello! There is a big billboard plastered right outside the casino's property! Strike two! The last straw for me was the food itself...so bland and boring! No inspiration with the cooking. I could have cooked this same exact food myself at home! No joke! Our 2 for $20 menu entrees came with soup or salad and breadsticks as a starter. The breadsticks were a bit of a joke, warm but very reminiscent of those from that 'Olive' place. Same shape too! Forgettable for sure. Pasta Cucina's house salad though was horrendous. The other unnamed 'Italian' place had a much better salad! Veggies were on the limp side and the dressing was watered down with not much pop. Sad. Our entrees didn't fare much better. I had the porcetta pizza with mushrooms and artichoke hearts. The crust was cracker thin which was nice and crispy, but the toppings were scarce and overdone from sitting under the oven or the heat lamp too long. Seriously, the small sprinking of toppings didn't give me much to go on, and the sauce and cheese were lacking in flavor and quantity. A real let down. My lady's chicken parmesan fared a little better but barely. The portion of food was much more acceptable, with two large chicken breasts, and a good serving of spaghetti and marinara. The spaghetti was okay but could have used more sauce and some salt and fresh herbs. The chicken parmesan itself was unimpressive since it really tasted like it came frozen instead of made fresh. The breading was soggy in some parts and actually nearly blackened in a couple spots along the edges from overcooking. I couldn't get past this because really, who likes burnt breading? Covering it with sauce and some cheese doesn't make the burnt taste go away. I flipped the chicken over to check and sure enough, over dark edges. This was strike three for me! We were out of there ASAP. Our waiter didn't bother keeping our drinks refilled, I had to ask him after they were sitting empty to fill them back up. We had quite a bit of leftovers from both entrees and asked for some to go boxes. Our waiter proceeded to take our food to the back and pack them up. At this point I was totally turned off from Pasta Cucina and just wanted to get out of there. I paid and even though I had some lackluster service from our waiter, I left him a 20% tip anyway. I take our leftover box and drive home. An hour later I'm hungry again. I open up the box and guess what?! Our lovely waiter only packed up my leftover bland A$$ pizza! No leftover chicken parmesan! Pasta Cucina is a B-U-M-M-E-R. Avoid! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Mandalay Bay is becoming a shell of its former self. It's supposed to be one of the higher-end hotel on the Strip, but this was my second stay there in a few months, and wow...not good. I will say a lot of this wasn't addressed because I was there only for a night, but had I stayed longer, I would have taken housekeeping and management to task over what I found lacking. However, that shouldn't deter from the fact that these were problems that weren't addressed before I checked into the room. At check-in, though the gal was efficient, rude and cold much? Barely looking up from the computer, she barely exuded the ""welcome"" Mandalay Bay prides itself on. Getting to the room, and wow, I was kinda disgusted. Housekeeping is apparently not a priority for the hotel anymore. Why are there rust stains around the fixtures? Why were the bulbs flickering on and off like they were about to die and not replaced immediately? Why were there stray hairs from the previous guests in the sink and shower? The best part? The water didn't drain in the shower. Gross. I checked out the next morning, a long line of people waiting to check out. Despite the fact that the line was growing, the number of people at the front desk didn't change. So then, my turn. I was not asked how my stay was, how my room was and if I was satisfied - which I found weird, considering every 3-star plus hotel front desk staff ask. Sure, he might have been harried because of the number of people trying to check out, but how is that my fault? I had to tell him the problems I encountered in my room. His response? ""Oh, thanks for letting me know."" Not even an apology on behalf of the hotel. Definitely not what I expect when staying at a high-end hotel. Believe me, I didn't expect free night or a discount or anything, I did however, expect (at a minimum) ""I'm so sorry about that. I hope you'll come visit us again soon and experience something better."" But, no. What's funny is that I got a survey a few days later asking about my experience. I debated filling it out, since I know they're rarely looked at and only want to highlight the positive things said about their properties. So, instead, decided to vent about it here. Needless to say, there are plenty of other high-end hotels along the Strip, and I will most likely stay there from now on unless forced to stay at Mandalay. Also, as the head hotel coordinator for various trade shows and events for work? Mandalay Bay won't be on my list. ",0,1,0,0,0

 If the star rating was just for the Beef Pho recenlty, it would be 5 stars! If it was for their Boba, it would be a 1 - thus the compromise of a 3 star rating. The Boba I had was, well, disgusting.

 Was out last night at a mixer at PT's pub... I pretty much go every friday night. It was late and after a couple of cocktails and no food ... it was time for food .. .seriously! El Pollo Loco is in the same parking lot so me and my friend Hoss headed over and got some chicken. I have typically had hit and miss meals with el pollo loco , sometimes I will get chicken and it will be raw in the middle ... that or just over cooked. Last night it was perfect. I love how they marinate this chicken it just tastes so stinkin good. So I pretty much devoured it like a wild animal (not eating since 9 am will do that to a girl and it was 1030pm) I have to say I am not crazy about their mac n cheese... and their potatoes are a little funky ... but the chicken was a double plus good.

They also had the best prices for installation as well. I highly recommend them to anyone that is looking for a company to install their flooring. I will definitely be using them again in the future.

 FINE, YOU WIN Ming Fu. Take my money. It's not like I have a weakness for small cozy places that serve Asian cuisine to perfection or anything. I don't know what kind of ninjas you have snooping around, finding out what my exact likes are and then creating a restaurant to meet those exact secret desires, but it's not fair that you play on all my weaknesses at once. How Ming Fu will destroy me financially: - Has great sushi my wife likes - Has a great selection of vegetarian options I like - Tastes better than PF Changs, without the wait - Tastes more authentic than Pei Wei, with more style - Tasty spring rolls - Good selection of interesting appetizers - Really nice servers and hostesses - A lively but comfortable atmosphere when it gets hoppin - Nice floors - no really, I love their floors, whoever did their decorating did a great job and picked out some nice flooring. As a person addicted to Asian fare, I like to snobbishly approach a new restaurant like Ming Fu, who covers a variety of Asian cuisine. I found everything so far to be above average to excellent.

 Giant Coffee's menu is not exactly giant. It's actually sort of sparse. Much of the wording on said menu is heavily littered with predictable buzzwords such as ""fair trade"", ""organic"", ""recycled"", which kind of never fails to annoy me. While I was standing there contemplating said menu, the air conditioning was blasting so hard I got goose bumps. Then I turned to contemplate the expansive space and saw the humongous front windows/doors were WIDE. OPEN. Yes. Wide open, spilling all the air conditioning out. Huh? Instantaneous loss of credibility. Yeah. So that said, the cash only deal is a bummer. Does anyone under 50 carry cash anymore? Total pain in the ass. If I have nine dollars on me, I don't to spend it all on overpriced coffee. The coffee itself is okay, very strong and a little burnt, as seems to be the trend in recent years. I could make it palatable with a lot of cream and some funky all-natural organic free trade green sugar-free alternative. It was definitely way too strong for my SO, who made a bit of a sphincter face with his first sip. The pastries are from Tammie Coe -- tasty, yes, but nothing you can't get elsewhere. The space IS gorgeous, don't get me wrong, and it's my favorite part of this shop. Disappointingly, the bathrooms are really average. Usually spiffy places like this have bomb ass bathrooms. The attached Bunky Boutique is super cute, and it deserves its own review. So yeah. Verdict? Too many other places to get coffee in this area... especially ones that open before 7 am, when I'm usually pounding the streets, desperate for caffeine. Time will tell how GC pans out... ",0,1,0,0,0

 Chose The Pub to hear the dueling pianos. We went in for dinner at 9:00 pm on Saturday night to hear the dueling pianos. There were 5 of us and we weren't very hungry so ordered appetizers: french fry trio, chicken quesadilla, nacho's, artichoke dip and a salad. It was a lot of food and it was good. The place was not busy at all, the piano players were asking for birthdays, anniversaries, etc so I wrote down it was my daughters 21st birthday with her name and put $3 or $4 dollars in the tip jar. Didn't even request a song. They never mentioned her even though they were begging for suggestions, etc. So my 'tip' would be to write down what you want and hand the piano player your ticket and money so he sees it. Don't bother with anything less than $5 if you really want a song played. 2 piano players started and then swapped out 1 player for another and they duplicated a song which struck me as odd since they'd only been playing for about 45 minutes. They were decent and fun but don't go if you want to talk and socialize because you can't hear anything. Staff was nice and attentive even though we weren't drinking. I'd probably go back again for the food and the dueling pianos but was disappointed (so was my daughter). Pepsi products only (YUCK) that's a disappointment. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Love the chairs and the screen experience. Parts I don't like: While at the bar I noticed the bar back drop some clean cups and water pitchers on the floor as he opened a cabinet. I watched to see if they would clean them after, but they didn't. They took them and filled them with water to be used in the movies. This kind of grossed me out. For god sake if it touches the floor it shouldn't touch your mouth! If I were the manager I would have made those kids use a cup I had just put on the dirty floor. Alcoholic drinks are really expensive considering how much ice they put in the cups, food and soda is only slightly expensive considering you are in a movie and soda refills are free. My girlfriends mojito didn't taste good at the bar, but the bar tender agreed to add more syrup to correct the flavor. I would go back, but hope they increase their sanitary standards and lower cocktail prices. ",0,0,1,0,0

 My review is on the casino as I did not stay at the hotel, I stayed at bally's. The casino itself is beautiful in my opinion and a great site to checkout on the inside and out. I recommend getting a picture of the Eiffel Tower at night. The restaurants inside are very nice and the food is good, however, some are very overpriced; especially the 'le burger' located near Bally's. You'll pay $15 for a burger alone and about $9 for a draught beer. I would avoid that place unless you truly want to pay a lot for burgers. They do have a good place to get bagels and other breakfast quick eats near their pizza place. The casino floor is very clean and waitresses seemed quick. They also have some neat gift shops. Unless you get a view overlooking the tower and bellagio I would recommend staying at Ballys based off the Paris room reviews to save some money. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was surprised at the prices - you can get a sundae for 5 bucks! Nowadays it seems like a milkshake costs you that much.. The items seem VERY sweet however, I guess they don't call it sugar bowl for nothing. I think I will ask them to go easy on the fudge and get nuts or something to balance out the flavor. I will definitely go back. ",0,0,1,0,0

 ""Oh Ma, a Cheesecake factory gift card! You shouldn't have"" no, seriously. She really shouldn't have. ""Nesto, take Helena out for a nice dinner"" Mom says beaming. At the Cheesecake factory??! But I love her... Cheesecake factory is ok. For the record I am not a cheesecake fan, so that being said... I took my mom out to lunch with the gift card, because she appreciated it, and Helena passed. LOL can't say that I really blame her. The place has issues with identity...and size. Basically Cheesecake factory is a bisexual man with a small penis, metaphorically speaking. I get the feeling that even their staff selection is based on this premise. All very nice folks, but somehow not decision makers in this world, so stuck in limbo. I had a Monte Cristo. It was very OK. My mom could make me better...hey there's an idea for next Christmas! Mom had the lettuce wraps and a gargantuan salad. I had Merlot, my mom had Gin and Tonic. It's a solid safe bet if you are from out of town and don't want to chance it on a better independant restaraunt--Although if you are on Yelp, there really is no excuse. We will steer you to a great restaurant. Other than that I can think of no real reason to frequent here. There are just too too many great restaurants that I want to try in the Phoenix area.

 Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was some of the best BBQ I've had in Arizona. The service was great as well! The manager stopped by a few times as well as our waiter to make sure everything was good. *****UPDATE***** Looks like they went out of business. Haven't been open for two weeks now..... ",0,0,0,0,1

 I heard rave reviews about Le Thai and decided to give it a try on a random Friday night. I am admittedly picky about Thai food, so I never get my hopes up. Since this is a new ""it"" place downtown there was an hour wait, even at 8:30 on a Friday. So we settled in outside and took advantage of the fantastic people watching. When we first put our names on the list there was a table for 2 open but they immediately put a ""reserved"" sign on it. Wouldn't you know that nobody showed up for an hour so we ended up with that table, mildly irritating! Once we were seated we were immediately brought water. I love me some water so I was really nervous with the tiny glasses they use, but they also bring a carafe so you can refill often. We also got a Thai tea and were pleased with the really large portion. We put in our order for the Thai style wings right away. The wings were fantastic! They were incredibly crispy on the outside and came with a spicy Siracha ranch sauce. I always go for Pad Thai with beef and this was no exception. The Pad Thai was good, but it was very different. It seemed almost like a stir fry with all components added, chopped, and completely mixed in the dish. The beef was not as tender as I would have liked, nothing like chewy meat. My husband had the awesome noodles with beef. They were good noodles, I don't know about awesome. They had a strong garlic and fish sauce flavor. They were thicker noodles which was nice and comforting. The wings were fantastic, but the Pad Thai was just not for me. The service was actually great, despite the other reviews I read. In my opinion, this is a trendy downtown restaurant so be ready to wait and dine in a noisy hipster environment. ",0,0,1,0,0

 A fun place, with okay food. I'm not a Parrot-head or whatever, but I still had a good time. Normally I'd say it's expensive, but considering it's Vegas I guess it was a pretty reasonable lunch (my wife and I ate lunch - hamburger and a club, had a couple of drinks) and it was about a $100. If I had one down the street I'd probably never go, but since I was on vacation it was a pretty cool place to grab a bite. ",0,0,1,0,0

 So the kitchen wasn't open late enough for me to have any food. Major bummer and the bar tender looked like he was trying to hurry every one along so that he could close up shop. I liked the decor of the place and the lay out. When I went after 10pm the patrons all seemed to know each other and be of the service industry sect. I was amused to listen to their stories of shitty tippers. I hope to try this place earlier in the day when I can actually have some grub. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Its in the middle of the Old Montreal tourist trap, but when you need something to eat it works. Among the restaurants on Place Jacques-Cartier, Amir had the only dishes that were cheap and they had a decent patio. We had two sangrias & linguine poulets. The food was good, but it was kind of confusing since we thought we were ordering the special (linguine primavera). Oh well. But they do get stars off for the constant waiting. The food took a while and wrapping up leftovers/getting the check took forever!!! ",0,0,1,0,0

 This was a great start to a night of drunken debauchery in Downtown LV. More info on that... never. Everything here is pricey, and this is coming from the guy who was upset when Taco y Taco raised their prices at their original location from $2.00 to $2.15. It's $2.60 here at the entry level, unless you decide to try the cactus taco (I didn't). I just went ahead and did the $8.95 combination plate for three tacos (chose al pastor, adobada, and lengua) with rice and beans. I'm not quite sure if the chips were part of the deal or if we actually did get them separately for our entire group. The food is pretty decent. I really did like the rice and beans, especially the beans. I thought the tacos were each okay, maybe the lengua being the best of the bunch. The al pastor did not come with pineapple, which was disappointing. It was also curious that there was only one tortilla per taco, not two as all the truly good places seem to use. By the way, I had a couple of beers from this place, but this doesn't need to be spoken about too much. In a Container Park context, this place is most likely a solid choice. But in the Vegas taco scene, it really isn't worth making the centerpiece of your visit. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I gave this place one star for the interesting concept of setting a spa on a tugboat. Other than that it is truly disappointment. Spent $150 for 90 minutes Therapeutic message which in the description states ""Ideal for individuals who have specific needs or pain. Targeting a single area, this massage treatment involves deep pressure to alleviate tension. Of course, it can also treat the whole body, from your head right down to your toes, if that is what you need most!"" The problem is that there was no deep pressure message, the message therapist just rubbed oil all over me and thats it. I was still uncomfortable in my shoulder and lower back after the 90 minute ""therapeutic message."" Also the staff was rude and snobby. The skinny tall guy at the front desk who spoke french was rude to English speaking customers. Not very professional!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Went in the day before Valentines Day to drop off my application with Michelle. We did not put on a unit number on top of the application because the unit we wanted was not available yet AND it was simply an application for approval. Once we did get approved, we picked out the perfect unit. We wanted a One Bedroom Deluxe overlooking the strip. Nancy showed us the unit on the 5th floor with a sunken living room, which we loved. (Juan didn't even know those units existed when we originally looked!) She then explained to us that one would become available in a couple weeks on the 6th floor, and we let her know that would be the unit we would like because it was higher. Long story short - They kept giving me the run around on when we were able to move. Kept telling me they would call me and never did, I had to call multiple times. Finally I went in on March 6th wanting to finish everything and see the unit after it had been cleaned. (Was told it was vacated on Feb 28th)..... Michelle went to show me the unit and IT WAS NOT THE UNIT we agreed on! Went back to the office and Stacy (Who is NEVER available to speak to anyone because shes always busy, but what it really is is that she doesn't want to speak to anyone) showed me the application I had filled out had another unit number on it. FIRST off, if you read above, Michelle NEVER put a unit number on my application because we were not sure of the unit number at the time. I explained to Stacy that we wanted the unit that Nancy showed us to begin with. Then Nancy chimes in and said SHE NEVER SHOWED US THE UNIT I WAS TALKING ABOUT!! And Stacy told me that it didn't exist! Stacy the told me the application I signed had the correct unit number on it. BUT MICHELLE NEVER PUT ONE ON THERE WHEN WE APPLIED!! They took it upon themselves and put whatever unit number on there and then Nancy and Michelle LIED TO MY FACE and told Stacy I didn't know what I was talking about and we never agreed to the other unit (Which was now rented) LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES Everyone there is a liar!!!! Seems like ive read other reviews that basically call them out as well! DONT RENT HERE!!!! LIES!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Let me start by saying any place that has so many coupon users is trying to compensate for something(Insert joke here) The concept is great, ""Carvers"" come out with various meats on a kabob for you to try in an all you can eat, bring it to your table buffet. A salad bar is available to fill you up*AHEM* I mean to offer vegetables and there is a cart that you can order a special drink that they will make in front of you by crushing... stuff(?) together. Let me set the stage. Six of us joined together to dine out and this was chosen due to a coupon that one couple had. The coupon offered 50% off our dining experience!(Two for one to be exact so you need even numbers) So for $33 we could enjoy meat and shrimp or for $39 we could enjoy the full surf and turf experience. Now, I'm not a mathematician, but I do know a thing or two about math but 50% off of the menu price of $50 doesn't not work out to $39...? Wait? The SAME meal is $29 at lunch? But hey listen, this was our friends anniversary after all, let's stay in the mood... Salad bar - Come on, we all know the rules. Don't fill up on the salad! I read that the salad bar is mediocre in previous posts... they were right. A salad bar with no iceberg lettuce... two choices of salad dressing - Italian and something that looked like a mix of Soy sauce and Miso soup. But no worries, I am waiting for the steaks! BRING ON THE MEAT! The rules of the game were laid out. You get a wooden thingie with red painted on one side and green on the other. Green means ""Bring on the meat!"" and Red means ""Bugger off, I'm full!"" so you rotate it to your desired position. When we started, green definitely meant GO! We were bombarded with ""carver"" after ""carver"" with shrimp, steaks, lamb, chicken with Bacon, scallops... I had to turn my little ""thingie""over to red within 5 minutes. For me, the excitement kind of ended their... The meat was hard to cut with the dull knives provided. You either got rare or overcooked depending on what side of the table the carver started on and the food was ok at best. Recognizing that people like meats cooked a different way, you would think a carver would ask what the preference was... but I suppose they are just carvers, we should count on our server to help... Uhm.. Server? When we sat down, we hadn't decided on our drinks yet so our server said he would be back.... he forgot to mention that it could be anytime that night... We were well into our food before I could finally wave him down. After ordering and waiting another 20 or so minutes I walked to the bar and grabbed the already waiting drinks and brought them to our table of cheering lighthearted friends. We didn't see our waiter again until the end of our meal... maybe he was disguised as a carver? Good thing for the drink table travelling around! Two polite girls asked us what we wanted for a special Brazilian drink. Not knowing what they were saying I said surprise us! They took 15 minutes to make 5 drinks. It was a good drink though, and they agreed with me, tipping their tip jar towards us so we could show our satisfaction at this concoction. Wait, we didn't get a chance to try it yet... maybe come back for the tip? No? okay... here you go... We were enjoying each others company when a host came up with a camera and mentioned how happy we looked(Maybe she was surprised?) and offered to take our picture for a ""complimentary"" photo. I had been in Vegas long enough to smell a rat and I wasn't shocked when our pictures came out - $30 for the group shot or $20 for the picture of us as couples. Perhaps they saw us coming a long way... they sold two pictures to our friends... My scottish roots came out as I started to clinch my wallet between one hand and my butt-cheek. The final bill... okay, I mentioned I wasn't a mathematician right? So I had the surf and turf, My wife had the turf and we shared three drinks between us(We would have drank more had our waiter existed) The other two couples had the same, except add one dessert each. So $39 x 6 plus desert, the added 20% gratuity, drinks maybe $8ea x 9 and two deserts for oh, we'll say $9ea = $435.... wait, what!? Our friends did some math on the other side of the table and decided it best to just pay up and enjpy our night... needless to say, I won't be back. Although the concept is good, turf service and mediocre food at surf prices earned this place every bit of the rating I gave. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I will have to be honest; this place would easily be a 2-star establishment if it wasn't for their awesome rooftop terrace! The rooftop allowed for a fun experience, and includes cornhole. The downstairs has a shuffleboard and darts, which also added to the night. Gin Mill, I want to like you. However, I've had your local brews on two separate occasions, and on both occasions the beers tasted bitter and stale. I suppose the 'run of the [gin] mill' crowd doesn't dig local draughts, but that doesn't excuse you from checking on the kegs every once in a while! All in all, 3 Stars. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Immaculate. Outstanding. Perfection. These are the words to describe my Sinatra experience. As I was eating I was thinking ""this is the best Italian food I've had in Vegas."" Towards the end i realized it was actually on the list of best anywhere. First and foremost I have to compliment Roger, our waiter. This guy was present, engaged and overall a complete professional. He was great with recommendations and pacing out the meal. They take care of their guests here and I just felt good with the whole transaction, even though it is pricey, there is serious value. For example, the bread they bring, if you told me it was baked in a Brooklyn bakery that morning, it would be completely believable. Or another example the silverware was actual silver. The glass they pour your water in sat well in your hand. The little things, the details, were all there. I started with the vegan Caesar salad, with lemon and capers instead of anchovies. It was amazing, clearly every rib of romaine was hand selected for crispness and quality. The Meatballs with Polenta Fries app was mouth watering and delicious. Amazing and worth the trip just for that app. Had a strong Chicken Marsala over gnocchi for entree and desert was the soothing Panna Cotta. Bam. The vibe of the restaurant is early 60's mod with warm pastels and floor to ceiling photos of Ole Blue Eyes. Really interesting decor, they have one of Frank's Academy Awards next to the hostess station, along with a Grammy and an Emmy. If they can get a Tony it will be an EGOT. So yeah... I had an amazing experience at this spot. Go there. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Do NOT book this hotel EVER. Worst Vegas stay!!! Where do I even begin with the crappiest hotel experience? We stayed here over Columbus Day weekend for a friend's 30th Bday celebration. We got a king suite with an adjoining two queen room in the Paradise Tower. Strike 1: They advertised a pullout couch and there was NO pullout couch. We called for a rollaway which they wanted to charge $20 a night. Excuse me? False advertising and I have to pay for it?! Called three times until finally got the rollaway in the room delivered. Strike 2: Asked for Nonsmoking room but the room reeked of smoke which did numbers on my allergies. I know I'm in Vegas, but I don't have to breath that crap while I sleep. Strike 3: the shower did not drain and water pooled up to my ankles. Called maintenance to repair and yet again they didn't show. Left for Pool/Brunch 4 hrs later returned with it still clogged. Called second time and finally they fixed it after waiting around 30 min before we could get ready for dinner. Strike 4: There is no room in the fridge for your own refreshments and a fridge is again $20 a day. Seriously for a suite what good is an in room bar without a fridge? For the price of the room it should be available. Guess they don't want you not buying THEIR drinks. Strike 5: As a hotel guest we should get free admission to the day pool parties at least on a guest list. Nope still have to pay- seriously? Marquee Day Club offers this to their hotel guests why can't Hard Rock? Strike 6: the TV cable was so horrible and kept cutting out couldn't play any music stations from that and there was no Auxillary input to plug in our own music thru the TV speakers. When we complained to the reception they only comped us one resort fee wow a whopping $22.50. I have stayed multiple times at the Hard Rock San Diego which is newer and has better rooms. They have the aux cable, working showers and correctly advertised rooms. Never ever staying at this Hard Rock hotel!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Regardless of the comment/response left by Lily and whatever half-ass team ConAm has I'm far from impressed with this complex. There is no consistency with the property management team. While I've encountered pleasant staff members there willingness and friendliness end in the halls of by-passing. The security continues to harass residents by constantly asking where they belong and for photo identification. Instead of harassing people who actually reside on the property; why don't they make themselves useful and stand at the gates that allow people who have no business behind the gates?! Focus on the constant smell of marijuana that plague the halls of some of these floors. Write a warning letter for the half ass cleaning of the court yards with empty trash cans and fallen light post. Rotate your staff members who occupy the leasing office because some of them either really hate where they work and don't understand the business of satisfying their guest/residents. Since when does paying over $1000+ for rent put a time limit on when and how we can utilize a business center on property grounds with (useless) security 24/7?!?! I've lived in this complex for almost a full year and when I first moved in using the club house was free of charge! Now you want me to pay you $200 and put another $200 deposit down just to use the space you created for US (the residents)?! Give me a break! Tell me again the perks of living here?! You have a side entrance for pedestrians on Swenson with no keypad to allow entrance once you've walked out. What sense does that make?!?! You've got some keypads at gates and doors into the building that either don't function AT ALL or doesn't have every resident listed! I see minor ""projects"" being installed throughout the property but they all serve minimal to no purpose. What the hell do we need guards at the mailbox area for? If anyone is retarded enough to pull straight up to their mailbox they deserve to have their car messed up. People should definitely be mindful if they are looking to rent from this company. The models may be beautiful and set up wonderfully but it's like putting lipstick onto a pig. Underneath all that pretty is something far less disgusting. Save your money and go elsewhere. My lease is ending in a few weeks and I'll be sure to post pics of the apartment I leave and whether or not I get my deposit back or if it gets lost with some sorry excuse for why the apartment was so horrible they need to rebuild a whole wing for it. Stay tuned.... ",1,0,0,0,0

 Hickory Tavern is a small but growing chain in the North Carolina. Serving dependable bar food with a great beer list, I can see why it's gaining popularity. They brand themselves as a steaks and oysters place, but they are really a sports bar basically (a tastefully decorated one though with minimal tschotkes). And a biggie for us, they were open Christmas Eve. This location is relatively new and has a large, airy atmosphere with high ceilings and tons of TVs. I've been to the Pinehurst location before, and ordered the same meal at both locations, the delicious Carolina burger. As anyone that knows me knows, the best condiment for a burger is more meat. The Carolina burger offers that meaty condiment in the form of chili paired with mustard. The burger is above average (mostly due to only having two options for temperature, medium well or well done - they may as well ask if I want my burger bone dry or burned), but the fries steal the show - in between steak and shoestring in size, they were cooked perfectly. They also have 1554 (in addition to Fat Tire), which helps soothe my New Belgium beer cravings. I can imagine this place being great to watch NFL games on Sundays. All in all, you can't really go wrong with Hickory Tavern - dependable food in a low key atmosphere with good beer. Things could be much worse in life. Now to get Red Oak onto the Hickory Tavern taps, and 1554 onto other restaurants taps. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I must refrain myself from giving this establishment five stars just because I touched, (yes, touched!) a particular football player here.

I would have gotten my picture taken if it was not for the big scary dude who told me, he doesn't take pictures in bars. Someone just doesn't want 'drink like a champion' pictures appearing again on deadspin. But, whatever. Decent bar. $2 you call it on Friday nights - at least when I was there and it went until 10:30.

 (Up front apology..... this is a slight reworked review from others I've done on Brazilian BBQ's in the Western states.) And know that I'd like to have given Texas a 3.75 stars if it existed, but have given the new Fogo in LV 4 stars, mainly for the meat quality. Our family is Brasilian. Here in Orange County, CA, we and our group of friends have tried just about every churrascaria that's opened or is still open in the Southwest. Many of us, during business travels, have also had the opportunity to sample US based Brasilian BBQ both on the East and West Coasts, and some in-between places..........like Salt Lake City, UT. Restaurant reviews need a reference point, and Brasilian BBQ's most especially. Over the last 20 years, we've watched them come and go; some very good, some horrible. Yolie's of Las Vegas, for example and IMHO, is on the ""horrible"" end. Problem with the Brasilian BBQ restaurants is their ability to be ""consistent."" While good food is a necessity, the style of service, called ""Rodizio"", is critical. And well trained ""Gauchos"", or meat-servers, are usually the breakpoint as to whether a churracaria is going to be rated high. Consider that most reviewers have had limited exposure to traditional churrascarias. In Brasil a churracaria can be a contained in a bus stop - gas station area, or as a full-on up-scale stand-alone restaurant. Regardless of size or ambience, it's primarily about the quality of the buffet, meats and the service. Example; ""The service here was excellent!"" That's probably true and understandable if you've never had a server bring filet to your table, multiple times. But ""excellent service"" at a Brasilian churrascaria includes a gaucho-server that knows his meats, asks you for your perferences, knows how to pass your table and show what's available without disturbing your eating. And again, they should be more than willing to help you with special requests. What you should expect from an excellent churrascaria is a hot and cold buffet style entree and salad bar. In Brazil, and at high end establishments, this includes high quality sushi and sashimi, and of course, rice, black beans and various vinigrettes and dressings. If you are a vegetarian, a great churrascaria should be able to keep you as full as your carnivor friends, with equal or better quality items. Service and food are usually what Brasilians speak of when chatting about their restaurant experience. It's a three-point system. And properly rated, you would seperate them, rate them, and then total up the score. Traveling through the US, my opinion is that there are no ""great Brasilian BBQ's."" Fogo de Chao in Dallas-Ft. Worth, so far, is the best experience I've had, while their Beverly Hills location was very dissappointing. T de B is adequate, but definitely not ""great."" If meat is your pleasure, then make sure to let the Gaucho-server and staff know your preferences. If you don't want to waste time on chicken and bacon frufru items, then just tell your server to, for instance, just bring you "".....rare filet, tri-tip, called ""picanha"" (pee-cahn-ya), or whatever you prefer. If you aren't getting rapid return service on the meats, then by all means, and because you're paying for it, let them know. You shouldn't have to, but if want to enjoy your meal, get that issue resolved early on. I'd say that Texas de Brazil is worth a moderate 3 star rating if compared to Fogo's Dallas-FW location. It is certainly much closer to traditional churracaria than any of the LV Strip hotel restaurants. I've tried them all and was sorely disappointed. If you're in the SoCal area, and close to John Wayne Airport, try Agora at Main and McArthur. If in the Long Beach area, a good ""blue collar"" consistently OK spot is Greenfield's. If you travel to Boston, Miami or the New Jersey areas, you'll find larger populations of Brasilians and better food overall. Just don't get too excited over Texas de Brazil. Yes, it's way better than most other spots in town, but I promise......... there's better. BTW..... most of the churracarias run a bit high on mixed drinks and also the desserts, but if they're good, they've prepared them ""in house."" ",0,0,1,0,0

 Check to see how you get your special girl a little extra treatment. I had $50.00 in my hand and was waving it around to try and get one of the guys to come over to my friend, but that didn't help at all. They focus on brides to be. So it might be a good choice if your friend is getting married, but call and check ahead of time, and make sure to sport one of those shoulder sashes across her! The guys are all good looking, there's no doubt about that. But whatever you do, DO NOT PULL YOUR PHONE OUT! I just tried to text my friend and some bouncer chick came over to me and made me move to the back of my table because I wasn't in the ""right"" seat. Well we had two tables and I didn't argue.

 Organ Stop Pizza is unique. The obvious big draw to this place is the massive organ and the very talented organist. Truly impressive and charming. While we were there he played several songs, all from different genres. My very busy bodied 7-year-old was very entertained. When you first enter the restaurant you go up to the counter to order. We ordered a simple pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms. We also ordered a ""small salad"" which is salad bar style, but there are several signs up that ask that you only take one trip to the salad bar. Lame. And again, seems like cheap skate business to me. Then when we went to pay, found out that they take CASH ONLY -No debit or credit cards. This is such a pet peeve of mine. It is 2014. Who carries cash anymore?! Add $0.05 to each item to cover the costs of having a credit card machine and call it good. Quit being ridiculous! They do have an ATM in the restaurant so, we quickly got cash out and then went to order our drinks....which are down the side of the counter and you pay separately for as well. Again, annoying. Why are the multiple stations necessary?? The dinning area is seat yourself and we found a nice little spot in the corner. It was very busy but we could still see pretty well. You are given a number on your receipt and the numbers go up on a big board in the dinning area, similar to a bingo board. Our pizza was ready pretty quickly but, the food was mediocre, at best, and very overpriced for what we got. For the large pizza, two small salads, and two sodas- it was just over $40. For a dinner out, that is pretty typical for that kind of order but, again- I was annoyed by the lack of service and inconveniences, and when I go out to eat, I want the food to be fantastic...this wasn't. I would however, highly recommend checking this place out AFTER having dinner somewhere else. Then get some cash out, come in, get some drinks and enjoy the organ for a few hours. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Nothing special about this place except that it's located in the Venetian. My wife and I were hungry and wanted a quick sandwich to eat before heading to the pool. The price was right, I believe around 7 bucks for a chicken sandwich, but the sandwich was TINY. Not much bread at all, which is what I was wanting to absorb the alcohol that was about to be coming. Sweet and simple review. I would rather pay 15 for a pastrami sandwich from Canters for sure. Our next time in Vegas this will be a vague memory. And if something isn't worth trying again, it sure as hell doesn't get more than 3 stars from me! ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is nasty. I seriously don't understand why anyone would like this place. Even for ""Americanized Chinese"" standards, there are still better options. Bubble Tea - Flavored with Corn Syrup, can't you tell? I can when I unwittingly bought a Strawberry and Mango (for a friend) it was so artificially sweet it burned my throat. Definitely not good bubble tea. And definitely not worth the price. Donated to some drunk friends who could stand drinking it. Food - Lucky me got suckered into someone's birthday dinner here... Being their birthday, I had to go and pretend to enjoy it. (Had I known we were going here, my skeptical experience over the bubble tea would have made me formulate a dramatic excuse.) I ordered a noodle dish and a tofu dish for the table (ma po tofu, I believe). Noodles were very dry. And tasteless. And they're known for their noodles? That just makes me incredibly sad. Nothing good to say about the tofu. If you want good tofu, go to Little Asia across the street. No comparison. Service - All the ladies here are impossible to flag down. ""Bad"" service is staple to a good Chinese place quite frankly, but if someone is waving their hand wildly for the bill for half an hour... Well, that's why this place is so seemingly crowded all the time. Better to just get up and fetch it yourself from the counter btw. Don't be fooled - this place is baAAAAaaaaAAd. Here are some local alternatives: Rose Tea Cafe, Little Asia, KaMei. If this review hurt the feeling of some local fans, take a vacation to SF, LA, or NYC Flushing sometime, you will understand the 1 and 2 starred reviewers' pains. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My wife & I visit the Rivers Casino every 4-6weeks...always starting-off our evening at the Grandview Buffet, mainly for the crab-legs. Over these last several months, we have discovered a trend, dealing with the crab-legs they are serving, to be, well, a lesser & lesser quality. We are no stranger to cracking crab-legs around town and even at casinos around the country, so we do know what we're talking about. The rest of the buffet fair is what you would find anywhere: some good, some bad, some fresh, some dried-out, but like I said - we are there for the crab-legs. My complaint: if you're going to serve second-rate crab-legs, don't charge a first-rate price...or at least be honest - let your customers know that your items aren't in the first-rate class, and not have them discover that on their own...after they paid upon entrance.

 Um. No. One star for the the lovely's filet, he said it was one of the best he's had. Second star for service and the chocolate lava cake. When I made the reservation, I told them it was Jeff's birthday. Upon arrival, they wished him a happy birthday and escorted us from the [handsome but very noisy] main dining room into what looks like a converted private space. No ambiance, no windows but quieter. And although we appreciate a reprieve from the noise, there was piped in [bad] music. Ugh. So I'm sitting in the back forty, eating a $9 salad that is mostly chopped iceburg lettuce, some cherry tomato and a few candied walnuts, drinking a Smirnoff Cosmo [my fault for not specifying the vodka] that had almost half a lime in it. Dinner was the lovely's 6 oz filet, baked potato and asparagus, and my Lobster tempura. He was happy, I was not. To their credit, lobster was perfectly cooked and but the tempura coating was so greasy - greasy as in they didn't drain it properly. The soy ginger sauce had so much salt I couldn't enjoy it and the accompanying jicama salad was overdressed. The chocolate lava cake was yummy, coffee was meh. Before dessert, manager Tracy brought a gift card and wished Jeff a happy birthday - a nice touch but we wont got back. For almost $200 we can have a stellar meal, more food, and a lovely experience at Capital Grille. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I too was eagerly awaiting this place's arrival. I'm a sucker for both coffee and Lola Tapas, so naturally I was intrigued. It was well worth the wait, even on the first day of business. Great, smooth espresso and awesome pastries from Sweet Pea's Danielle Librera. I dig the whole vibe going on here; it fits in very well next to Haus and the other little shops in this ever-evolving plaza. The retro modern feel and color scheme make it one of the more lively coffee spots in these parts (that's a good thing) and I love the little diner touch with the bar stools looking out onto Central Ave. Judging from the crowd they had at 6:30 p.m. on their first day of business, I'd say we have a winner.

 We went back to Osso last night. We were meeting friends who had reserved a table out on the patio so that we could listen to the Friday Live concert. Sadly, for this visit, the service really suffered which is why I have down-graded it to 2 stars. We arrived around 8:30 and it took around 30 minutes before we got drinks. But worse was that our entrees didn't come out until 10. They were busy, but still that was really disappointing. By the time our food came out, we were hungry enough to eat our shoes. This time, I tried the ravioli. It was a simple cheese ravioli with a simple but fresh tomato sauce. It was much better the dish I had on my last visit, but it really wasn't anything special. The dish was reasonably priced at $13.95. One person in our party got a salad with chicken. The salad was $6.95 and to add chicken breast was another $6.95. The salad looked good, but not sure if it was worth $14. Another person in our party ordered the steak. He said it was pretty good, but not worth the $32 price point. Unfortunately, many of the items on their menu include pork or red meat. Since their menu is fairly limited, there aren't a lot of reasonably priced choices for for someone who doesn't eat meat or for those who have problems with gluten. Next time we go down to the NC Music Factory, I think I'll skip Osso and try one of the other restaurants. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Located in the food court at MeKong Plaza, this is a great place for authentic and very tasty Filipino food. We ordered the BBQ chicken plate and the bangus (fried whitefish) as well as the palabok that we ate within the food court. Absolutely fantastic! We live in Prescott Valley and there isn't a decent Asian restaurant within 50 miles. It was a real treat to eat Filipino food again and this restaurant won't disappoint! Atmosphere isn't that great, but the people who work there are terrific and the food is wonderful. We got the dinuguan to go and it was also terrific. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Previously I gave 4/5 stars to this place, and I have the urge to correct it now. It's 5/5, if I can add another star, I would, because this place is very very special to me. Their ramens have improved a lot, and I like the fact bachi - Shoku is now the same restaurant. My hubby can eat his burger while I eat my noodles. Everyone is happy. More seatings, modern decor, same friendly services, crazy busy kitchen. What's not to love about this place? The only request? Bring back fried chicken from original Shoku please !!

 Perhaps one mark of authenticity at Fugu is the fact that a lot of the menu will scare and confuse you. Blood intestine? Bean curd? I have yet to be adventurous enough to try one of these menu items. I instead try to settle on something that resembles your typical Chinese take-out, without going for anything too boring. I always start a meal here with the spring rolls. They're cooked to a perfect texture, with a thin, crispy outer shell that crunches like a potato chip, and a soft vegetable-filled mush inside. They taste a little bland, but that's easily offset by the great sweet-and-sour sauce served on the side with the spring rolls. I highly recommend the beef with ginger and scallions as an entree. Whereas most Asian places will overload a dish with vegetables in order to save money on the meat, Fugu has done the exact opposite. I almost missed the vegetables, but the meat is too good for me to care. It's cooked so perfectly, to the point where it practically melts in your mouth. You'll find meat like this in all their beef dishes as well. On a different occasion, though, I decided to get the fried shredded beef in hot chili sauce, and wasn't as impressed. Once again, the beef was a perfectly-cooked blend of fat and meat that made it taste and feel like beef and butter had a baby. It was cut into thick strips which could hardly be called ""shredded,"" but that was probably for the best. The sauce and spices surrounding the beef, on the other hand, weren't too good. I was warned that the dish was going to be very spicy, but I certainly wasn't expecting to be served a dish that was almost half comprised of chili peppers and ginger. Most of the dish wasn't even edible! If you do decide to get something simple like the chicken lo mein, you'll be pleased with it. I didn't get anything that goes above and beyond all expectations, but honestly, I don't even know how you could do so with something like chicken lo mein. The lo mein was soft and buttery, with a simple and traditional blend of add-ins. The chicken was good, but nothing special. All in all, it's certainly better than take-out. The prices here are slightly higher than normal, but you do get a noticeable step up in quality that justifies it. Furthermore, the portions are huge. Unless you plan on taking home leftovers, you should probably just buy one entree per two people. The service is consistently a problem. It is somewhat slow, even when the restaurant is empty. Requests for things like condiments are often ignored or unanswered for long periods of time. This is due in part to the fact that most of Fugu's staff has very poor English. It's very irritating that I can't have menu items explained to me because myself and the waiter can't even understand one another. You can put whoever you want in your kitchen, but it's unacceptable to put out a wait staff that can't communicate with the customers. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Del Taco is the best Mexican chain fast food ever. Go on Tuesday for taco tuesdays. It's 3 regular (beef) tacos (hard or soft) for $1. Otherwise the tacos are $.49 each. Thursday are 3 chicken soft tacos for $2. Yes, it's totally worth it. Get the Del Inferno sauce if they have it. I get 90000 packets and use it when I cook (when that happens 4 times a year). The chili cheese fries are bomb too. But don't order any of the burgers here; it's a trap! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. We stood around a little awkwardly when we got there since we didn't know if we should seat ourselves or wait for someone. After a while we just sat ourselves. They have free peanuts at all of the tables which was perfect since I was really hungry. I opted for the half sandwich and half salad. I went with the meatball sandwich since it's been a while since I had one. The salad is nothing special, just a simple side salad. The sandwich was really good, no complaints here. The bread was perfectly toasted too. It was kind of annoying having to swat pesky flies away while you're trying to eat. My bill was just a little under $10 which seems high to me for what I got. They have a dog friendly patio which is pretty cool but I can't imagine having to sit outside while it's hot out, even if it did mean getting to eat with your pup. They had a ton of TV screens which is great if you're trying to catch a game. College football was on and there was a big group of Nebraska fans there catching the game. I think service here can be hit or miss. Our waitress wasn't bad, a little slow at times but we weren't in a rush. I noticed that the table next to us was sitting for a while before they got a menu in their hands or was given any attention. I think they sat themselves too. I did notice a family who came in that did get seated. Maybe they were short staffed? I wouldn't be opposed to coming back here but it wouldn't be my first choice. I'm rarely in the Chandler area anyway. ",0,0,1,0,0

 My wife and I asked around for a nice steak house, and got several recommendations, and decided on N9ne. As everyone basically states this is more of a night club atmospher. I has no problem with this as the place is very nice. Although not what you would expect in a high end restaurant, but nice. The waiter was ok, not what I would expect, but again I was happy. I love bread ,and didn't care for the kind they serve there, but that was just my preference. My wife ordered a glass of wine which she absolutely loved, and I ordered a g;ass of iced tea which was tasty. I ordered the wedge salad to start and it was great. My wife just picked off my salad. I ordered the bone in ribeye which was probaly the best steak I ever ate. The sad thing here is I added crab legs for $24.00 to add to my meal,and they should put on the menu crab leg for $24.00. I only got one crab leg and was disapointed with this item. I ordered a baked potato for $11.00 which was good, and my wife ordered a bowl of lobster bisque soup which she loved. So with that said I ordered a steak $54.00 a salad $12.00 oh don't forget the crab leg (and I do mean crab leg) $24.00 baked potato $11.00, Iced tea $2.00 (thats a great deal) my wife ordered lobster bisque $12.00, a glass of wine $14.00 with a total of $139.45 with tax included. With that said the service was ok not great like you would expect in a restaurant that charges these kind of prices. My iced tea was left empty on a regular bases and the water wasn't filled on a regular bases either. I loved my steak I must say. We would go back, but I would just order a steak, salad, and potato, and not expect excellant service, and it would meet my expectations. As you can see the only thing that didn't make this a 5 star was the service. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Well, I'm a relative noob to the whole Vietnamese culinary experience, but it has slowly been growing on me. I have had the opportunity to eat at Pho Little Saigon several times and it has been consistently good. I have limited myself to the Charbroiled Pork Bun and the Banh Mis...both of them hit the spot and I feel like a good portion of food is served for the price.

 I ordered an item through wayfair and received a call for delivery from a Brian. He sounded nice on the voice message but when I ended up speaking with him and trying coordinate shipping options, he was very rude. It seemed like he didn't want to help me and came off as condescending when I was just seeking clarity on their process. He kept saying things like ""but that's not guaranteed"" or ""I don't know I'm not the one delivering it"" or ""you would know better than me."" I ended up telling him to put me down for a 6-10am window since it was the only realistic option and he couldn't guarantee they would be delivering on the next weeekend. He said he needed to just call me back but at that point i decided i would call next week in hopes i would get someone with better customer service. He called back but didn't leave a message. Driver showed up at 730 when I wasn't home. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the contracted driver Michael was accommodating and waited for me. It was an easy delivery, I just wish my experience with hot shot had been less frustrating. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Well I've been to eat at their cafe twice now and it was easily the worst service I've ever had the second time. The four separate individuals who attempted to serve us got very confused as to who was handling what and as a result I never got a refill for the table's sodas/beers or got a chance to ask for things like ketchup or jam and we ended up grabbing them off other dirty tables nearby. When my server-one of them- came for our drink orders, I asked what beers they had on tap. she told me none, so I asked for the bottled beers list. She answered ""I dunno, Bud Lite, Budweiser, there's a lot."" She literally threw up her hands and shrugged. She did not know how much it was a beer and said ""Something like that,"" when we asked if it would cost more or less than $5. It was like pulling teeth, it's a shame that these people have jobs when there are way less lazy homeless people out there. I ordered eggs over easy which came fully cooked in the center and were served with cold bacon and rye toast. The toast came out well. My bf got the chicken fried steak, which is pretty tasty, but the check was dropped with the meals and no one offered us refills despite the fact that my boyfriend made a point to ask twice. We wanted to get dessert and split the check, but it seemed like they really, REALLY didn't feel like up selling that day. We flagged someone down finally to order dessert, got gross mushy apple pie which they claim is made fresh every day. Well, I've had better pie at McDonalds. It was gross and if they are really baking these fresh they should stop now and invest in some Sara Lee frozen crap because it's better tasting than their pie. My buddy picked up the check rather than try to get these geniuses to split the check properly. I've never even seen such an I-Don't-Give-A-Crap attitude from someone at work before. There are people who are unemployed who would love an opportunity to give great service and get a good tip, but the people employed at the Silver Sevens cafe clearly don't care at all. Finally we got a manager and complained and he just took off the cost of the pie and apologized. Him and the very sweet hostess who seated us were the only good things in the place. I miss Terribles. This never would have happened when it was Terribles. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This is my other go to Smiths as it's near the GFs apartment so I hit it regularly and too often without a list; Its near my other favorite Dry Cleaners so I hit two stores at once when I come here and it makes it convenient for me. The parking lot can be hazardous so be careful of random carts rolling in the breeze and careless drivers speeding up and down the Aisles; The produce here is top notch; never disappointed; we haven't purchased any meat products here but it always look like they are cutting and displaying everything properly; The other patrons can be kind of scary so it best to come early in the day when the freaks are asleep. Also it seemed odd but walking out of the store with a package of water and an arm full of bagged groceries I was stopped and asked to see my receipt as the cashier didn't place a sticker on the water. I hardly look like a criminal/shoplifter and I wasn't hurrying out the store so it seemed inappropriate to stop me when nobody else was being interrogated. I guess everyone is viewed as a criminal here or the guy at the door was just being overzealous/trying to show off to a few cute ladies standing nearby. I didn't make an issue out of it since he was trying to get him some but if you are reading this (smiths employee) you have to wonder; what kind of lady is going to be impressed that you shook a guy down in a military haircut for a case of water and is that really someone you want to hook up with? Its that incident alone that gives this store 3 stars but still worth your trouble; just make sure you have that paid sticker on your large items before you leave the store! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Considering our friends were staying at the University Inn, I think we won. The location is clutch, adjacent to Monona Terrace and right off of the capitol. Some of the rooms even have lake views. We had a decent group rate since we were there for a wedding, but I can't remember how much it actually cost. The room was a standard hotel room, but the bathroom was really, really dark. So dark, in fact, that I had to do my makeup in the armchair by the windows instead of in the bathroom. If I hadn't done that, who knows what kind of monstrosity could have come out of that dimly lit loo. Put some better lighting in there, Hilton. The bed was really comfy, with GREAT pillows.

 We had dinner in the bar. The bartender was great but the food was horrible. The salad was soggy and old. The salmon was not fresh and topped with some kind of butter that likely was mixed with their branded dry seasonings. The potatoes were not cooked all the way through. My husband's steak had little flavor. The tea water was warm and tasted of coffee. A definite waste of $200. We brought the left overs home for the dogs and then threw them in the garbage in the end.

 I would definitely stay here again. I wasn't expecting luxury by any means but I also wasn't expecting it to be as decent as it was. We needed a last minute place to stay and booked a room for that night for $50. You get what you pay for, and those that complain about how grungy it was should have known that when they booked it. It is pretty far off the strip, but not nearly as far as Hard Rock. They sell $1.50 Bud Lights at the bar inside which is always a plus. I joined the Owl Club to get the $200 free slot play. I didn't win anything but I didn't lose anything either. The people that worked the counter were friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and had a television, what more can you ask for? Like I said, I definitely would stay here again when I was looking for a cheap hotel option in Vegas. Oh and just a warning, the walls are REALLY thin and you can hear pretty much everything going on in the room next to you. If you are going to Vegas for a quiet experience you are in the wrong place anyways. Also, DO NOT go to the Hooters inside the hotel. Its absolutely awful. (see my other review) ",0,0,1,0,0

 I came here with a big group and was excited to have a good dinner, however that did not happen. First, half of our party was going to be late so we decided to put in an order of appetizers and order two bottles of wine for the table. Ten minutes later the rest of our party showed up.. Another five minutes our caprese appetizer came, then the wine a couple minutes after that. Finally after 10 more minutes we reminded our waitress about the garlic bread we ordered and only then did it come to the table. Then as the rest of the party was getting their drinks the waitress spilled a tray of three ice teas all over one of the women in my group and her purse. Since we were a big party and the waitress obviously messed up I thought it would be appropriate for her to offer to comp some of our drinks, this did not happen. Later, we were ordering all of our food and we decided to just split all of the entrees. Since I'm a vegetarian I decided I was going to order the gnocchi to be sure there was a dish I could eat, however our waitress informed me they were all out of the gnocchi that night. So not wanting to make a big deal about it I informed her I was vegetarian and since one of the dishes my party had already ordered was the Quattro al Forno (which included the Cheese Manicotti, Chicken Cannelloni, Baked Ravioli and Stuffed Shells), she explained that all were vegetarian except the chicken cannelloni. I hadn't really studied the menu so I trusted what she said and told her that i could get by on eating off of those plates. Fast forward to when we finally get our dinner, someone in my party advocated for me to get first pick at the plates ""without meat"" so I got a stuffed shell and some of the baked ravioli. After eating the baked ravioli i started chewing some of the stuffed shell and realized there was indeed meat in it. I quickly spit it out but couldn't believe there would be meat in the dish. When the waitress came back a member of my party asked the waitress again if there was meat in the stuffed shells and she said no. Then I spoke up and said there was and that I had tasted it. She responded that she would go check on that. She came back a few minutes later and told me what I already knew, that there was meat in the shells. She offered no real apology to me, did not offer to bring me out another dish or comp anything. I was so upset and felt so sick after that it really ruined the rest of my dinner and night, not to mention I have been vegetarian for six years and this waitress couldn't even offer me an apology for something that was clearly her mess up.

 This place served up one of the worst customer experiences I've ever seen a restaurant provide. We went in and although the place had plenty of seating it took them almost 20 minutes to seat 8 people. We told our waitress (who was really trying her hardest to keep up while her managers stood up at the bar and laughed) that we were in a hurry and put in our drink order. After close to 15 minutes we finally got our drinks and ordered up 5 rolls. Nothing special. We finally got the first one almost 40 minutes after that. Three of our party had to leave without eating. The food was very average. After that we asked for our check and again a long delay before we got our bill. We asked to speak to the manager about this and he finally came over another 15 minutes later. When we spoke to him about our experience he became extremely agitated and offered to pay for one of our rolls. I told him thanks but no thanks and I would just pay the bill. Then I informed him that this situation was obviously not our waitresses fault because the management was as bad as you'll find in this part of Scottsdale. As we were leaving he told us that he never wanted us to come back again. Absolutely AWFUL experience. ",1,0,0,0,0

 ate here the other night and developed some mixed feelings. it took the waitress 40 minutes (yes, timed to the minute) to bring us our beers after ordering. she forgot to place our food order, so that took even longer. eventually the manager intervened and gave us a new waitress (who was great). the food was decent (i had a burger), but nothing to rave about. as far as food is concerned, i expected more from a brew pub. the beer, however, was great. worth checking this place out, especially on a nice day. i'll give this place another shot...i won't let one waitress spoil it for me :-) ",0,0,1,0,0

 I loved staying here. I just wish my friend and I spent more time in the hotel room or at least got to take advantage of one of the many pools. But instead w got distracted by all the blackjack tables, and we gambled away late into the night and came back to the room only to sleep and shower. The next morning I'd be crying about how hungry I was, so we'd leave in a hurry, only never to return until my friend won all the money he lost back (and let me tell you, it took a damn long time for that to happen!)

 I glanced over all these rave reviews and I'm sorry I get lazy to go into detail bc it seems so redundant! So, here's another gushing review of this place, I'll try and keep it short! Came here for a lovely Valentine's dinner and.. It's awesome. So far, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Love the dark decor with purple furnishings, dazzling chandeliers, glod accents, and plush cushions. Their service was on point. The plating was beautiful and flowed nicely. The only thing I didn't enjoy were their fake candles. I guess they got sick of scraping wax off the tables? My favorite is the bread cart--I'm a carb girl. I could sit there and eat bread all day and be satisfied. We had the 4-course dinner and we were beyond full by the time we got to dessert. I'm not sure how people eat the 6 course or even the 16 course tastings. I guess you'd have to skip out on the bread. The foie gras was my favorite, as usual. It literally melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting MORE. The second favorite was the dessert cart with coffee. I love picking and choosing and then picking more! Just like the bread cart my eyes get big and I get greedy! Can't wait to come here again so I can try the 16 course tasting. Gotta save something for next time, right? ",0,0,0,0,1

 I thought this place was going to be so much better than it actually was. It was ranked the best steakhouse in Las Vegas on a few sites and now I wonder if those sites were sponsored by Carnevino. It is a nice restaurant with great service. I tried the dry aged bone in ribeye, mashed potatoes, and beef cheek ravioli. We were warned the steak was a bit rarer than usual and what would usually be ordered medium-rare should be ordered medium. We took that advice and ordered the steak medium but it came out pretty much rare. The mashed potatoes were ok. I LOVED the beef cheek ravioli though, that was amazing. If you want a great flavorful steak with a nice crust, go to Wolfgang Puck's Cut instead. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Agave is super fun. Gorgeous decor, great patio, fabulous margaritas and yummy chips and salsa. The service and food are sub-par in my opinion, especially compared to the other awesome Mexican restaurants in the area, but it is still a fun place to go for drinks and a good time, especially when the weather is nice and you can enjoy the patio with fire places!

 If you walk down the strip, you will for sure see Margaritaville. I have passed by this place many many times, but last week was the first time I actually went in to sit down and eat. If you do come here, the one thing you SHOULD order is the nachos. This will feed a family! It comes out in a huge tower and it really is hard to miss when the waiters bring out the platter of nachos. They are generous with the jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream and cheese; which is why it is so worth getting! Andrew D. and I both ordered burgers, but sadly they were not as good. I ordered the portobello mushroom cheeseburger and he ordered the bbq bacon cheeseburger. His burger actually tasted better than mine. Bacon always makes things better, doesn't it? My portobello cheeseburger was kind of lacking taste. Already filled from alcohol from the night before, we also didn't get a chance to order a margarita. However, their margarita menu is extensive and it looks like there are a lot of crazy drinks you can order. Service was a little too slow for me, but the waitress was really nice. For 2 people, it will cost you around $50. A little on the pricey side for just nachos and burgers. However, I may come back again for just the nachos. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Authentic Mexican food? I don't so! I went in on a Tuesday afternoon with a few friends. We were not greeted when we walked in. However, we were seated with in a couple of minutes. One of my friends noticed that the chips were stale so she proceeded to ask for fresh beans. I ordered 2-enchilada dinner with black beans. The tortillas from the enchiladas were tough, I couldn't cut them using only a fork. Enchilada's are supposed to be tender, it really seemed as the tortillas were left out and used the next day. The Black beans were so bland and came out of a can. I ordered a side of guacamole and had to ask the nice server to take it back. It tasted really bad-not fresh at all. I have given two stars for the service. It's not the waiters fault so I can appreciate them. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Brought back three paintings from Peru that needed to be stretched back on to wood and then framed. Two of them were quite large. I went to Michael's Arts & Crafts and their ""special 70% off sale offer"" was $1,300 to frame the three paintings. Absolutely ridiculous. I found Gary online and took a chance. He came to my apartment at a time convenient for me, picked up the paintings, stretched, framed them, delivered them back to my apartment, and helped me hang them on my walls. This was all with a two week turnaround and for 1/3 of the price of Michael's. Incredible. The only minor drawbacks are 1) he only takes cash, which is understandable, but a little inconvenient, and 2) if you are like me and have no sense of artistic style it's a little nerve-wracking to pick frames based on photos instead of having a sample like you would in store. Still, Gary gave me good advice on the frames and I am 100% thrilled with the outcome. Definitely save your money and time -- skip Michael's and call Gary. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've been trying different deli's all over town and I would say that overall this place is just Ok. I would stop here before a subway ..

 I've played my fair share of games, from retro to the modern.. this place seems to have em all; But coming on a Saturday night rendered everything unplayable due to the packed house. I could barely even walk through the joint with all the people inside. I could see this place being a decent hangout spot to kill time in the afternoon. But at night, this place turns into a sausage fest to which you can't even navigate to play a game in order to forget that you're in this bratwurst bash. It seems like the place is clashing two incompatible cultures: nerd-culture and nightlife. It's sad to see the obvious gamer (me) slouched down sadly because he can't get to his Galaga machine. There's no one playing it, but there's a group of bros trying to hit on the 1 of 5 girls in the entire building. Yeah, the music was bangin'. And yeah, the place did look pretty cool. However, I went here with a couple buddies to simply play games, grab a few drinks, and avoid the ""clubbing"" atmosphere. We were unable to play any games and the club was brought to us. We ended up walking out and sought something else to do. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Best Chinese food and dim sum on the Eastside. Dim sum is fresh and has good choices.

 The worst Roberto's - ordered a #4 which is the 2 taco combo and a carne asada burrito to go. Got home and saw that the tacos barely had meat in it so went back to the restaurant to give them an opportunity to fix the issue, instead the cashier had a poor pissed attitude telling us that that's how they come?!? We've been ordering this for years I mean years and this was the very first time I've seen it poorly executed. A two taco for a buck was way better than that food. I was so livid I was not able to take a photo of the mess. We will never go back to this restaurant. Poor attitude, service, and worst food! I see closure in y'all's future! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I ate here last week for lunch. It's expensive, but you can't expect less for a buffet in a nice casino located on the strip. If you're not used to paying this price, don't go because you still have to remember that it's a buffet. The portions are beautifully crafted (my initial take was to control portion waste) but its brilliant for reasons that you don't get people stirring around in the food, it gives it more of a high end feel and allows you to try everything! Just brilliant!! The selection is smaller than what I'm normally used to though. A few of the Asian dishes were on the salty side but that may work for some people. Fried chicken wings (comes in 2 in its very own basket) was amazing--perfectly crispy, seasoned and freshly made. Salmon: good, salad: good, dessert: awesome, even for someone like me who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth. Seriously though, you can't go wrong with all you can eat gelato, right?! Right. It appears there's a lot of hype about this place so you will have to wait a little to be seated and to get in your drink refills. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I really like this place. We came here for a quicker dinner last night and for the breakfast buffet in the morning. It's conveniently located a few steps from the elevators and is decently priced. They have real soft and tasty bread they bring out while you're ordering. I consumed a pulled pork sandwich on whole wheat bread which was THE BOMB. Dad got the rachel (pastrami) which he said was ""very good and tender"". The breakfast buffet rocks. its like $16 a person and they have an omelette station, sausages, bacon, ham, scrambled eggs, assortment of breakfast muffins/pastries, few different cereals (the house made granola and nuts is great), and some oatmeal. Simple, tasty, good, drinks included, very little wait time even on this busy summer weekend. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Food is decent, and service is good. Try the Lao Specialties on the menu, and go for Native Lao spiciness if you can. Other items you can find in other Thai restaurants. My only complaint: I think LLX tries to accommodate American taste by removing organ meat in their larb dish. Just meat and spice, no intestine or liver in the mix. That's a pity! Lao dishes come with sticky rice. Make sure it's warm. All Southeast Asian Studies people at UW love this place. So that's quite a seal of approval. If any of the Wisconsinites visit Chicago, be sure to give Sticky Rice Restaurant a try. They specialize in Northern Thai dishes, which are very similar to Lao variety. You save a trip to Chiang Mai.

 Have to give a shout out to this place. Although I have only gone to ""Cocktails"" a few times in the last few years, it will always have a special place in my heart. Flash back 25 years ago. My Dad used to take me here for happy hour with his work buddies. Some may say that isn't good parenting. Maybe its not. But I have very fond memories of sitting up at the bar getting my cheeks pinched by the bartender and the patrons. The nice, smoky voiced, wrinkly blond female bartender would put a zillion maraschino cherries in my shirley temple. And I would play darts with my Daddy. I feel warm and fuzzy just thinking about it. Once I would hit adulthood I would stop in every so often. Though my life was constantly changing this bar just felt like home. Another warm fuzzy memory? My brother proposed to his amazing wife here on New Years Eve a few years ago. I wasn't there at the time, but he text me pictures after the proposal. Great prices, great service, great memories. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I truly was a weary traveler when I visited this restaurant. I had spent the last two days helping my best friend move into his new apartment in Madison, carrying heavy furniture and boxes up several flights of stairs in an un-air-conditioned building. I was feeling a little drained, a little passionless, but THEN! The clouds parted and revealed to us the Weary Traveler, and we decided to stop there for lunch. The Weary Traveler was JUST what this weary traveler needed to get her groove back. A great, kitschy vibe, friendly and attentive staff, a fully-stocked bar and, most importantly, great food! I had the Bob's Bad Breath Burger, which came with fantastic fried potatoes and fresh greens. I've had many a burger in my day, but let me tell you: this was one of the best. My best friend had the divine French toast, which was so delicious I continually begged him for another bite. In fact, the only part of this dining experience that I regret is that I didn't order one of their wonderfully huge Bloody Mary's! However, there's always next time! In short: Whether you're a local or, like me, truly a weary traveler looking for a great meal, the Weary Traveler is the place for you! ",0,0,0,1,0

 My wife had a physical in September with Dr. Janis Saunders. She is the worst Doctor that we have ever encountered. She was rude, crass, and has no customer service skills or patient skills. Get this - after she measured my wife's waist she said to my wife ""that's big, you carry all your weight in your waist"". What a rude thing to say to a patient!! There are many other ways to convey this to a patient, like, oh you've gained some weight, we need to work on that, has your diet changed? Something like that. She said other stupid things like when my wife said it was hot in the examination room she said ""oh yeah that's for me, I'm always cold so I keep it hot in here"". OMG doesn't the patient's comfort come first?! She also stayed in the room after my wife had her pap smear and my wife had to get dressed with her still in the room! No privacy! No feelings! Needless to say we are changing doctors and will not be returning to Parkway Medical. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We love Thai food and after reading the article in the January issue of Phoenix magazine elected to give Tottie's a try. We arrived on a Friday evening to a partially full restaurant. Found the decor and feel of the restaurant to be pleasant enough - the hostess was also very cordial, but I'm afraid this is the extent of the compliments we can pay this establishment. Service was extremely slow - starting with a long wait of even having a server approach our table. Everyone seem to be scurrying around - including our view of Tottie and her staff behind the front line; but the overall service was not expedited to showcase a well run operation. Our shrimp puff appetizer arrived - and to our surprise and dismay, would guess that the pastry portion was a Pillsbury product, rolled out thin and fried. After another long wait our entrees finally arrived, and again, while the portions were generous, the anticipated flavor and quality of each of our dishes just wasn't there! (Shrimp tasted fishy ... my chicken didn't seem to be fresh). Sorry to say - we will not be back and instead will return to our other 'tried and true' Asian restaurants, where we are assured both good service and flavorful quality food! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Okay, I realize that I tend to give out a lot of 5 stars but this one is well deserved. I wish I had gotten the girl's name who helped me out as she deserves a raise. My grandmother passed away and we wanted to enlarge a photo of her to frame and put up at her memorial service. The best photo of her that we had was her high school graduation photo. She graduated from Chandler High in 1952. My cousin and I started out at a camera shop that blows up portraits for around $50. Although it was going to be expensive we both felt it was okay because it was for her memorial service. The guy behind the counter asked me for my copyright release. I stared at him for a moment and then said, ""Oh I don't have one, this is my grandmother's high school grad picture from the 50's and we're using the photo at her memorial service."" to which he replied, ""I'm sorry, but without the release we cannot enlarge this photo for you."" I told him that there had been a big fire and a lot of the old paperwork including my Grandmother's high school records had been lost (which is true), but also probably any records about who even took the high school senior photos at that time. He sent me away apologizing but being quite abrupt. I left completely angry and in tears because A - I just lost my Grams, who was like a mom to me, and B - the memorial was in less than a week and if every photo shop was going to ask for a copyright release, we were in trouble. I looked over and noticed Kinkos and thought, ""Heck, I'll just go blow up the photo myself and see if it looks okay."" We drove over and once inside noticed that it was a smaller Kinkos and we may not be able to blow it up ourselves. I asked hesitantly if the girl behind the counter could enlarge the photo for me. Not only did she say absolutely but she edited the photo a bit on her computer to remove a note my Grams had written to her grandparents on the front corner of it so that the photo would look nice in the frame at the memorial. I'm pretty sure they would have charged me an arm and leg to do the same thing at the camera shop. She said that they don't worry about copyrights on photos for memorial services since we were not going to be selling them or anything. She also noted that since over 50 years had passed you don't really need a copyright to reprint family photos of this nature. She took the small high school photo and enlarged it to fit in a 11x14 frame. Not only did it look beautiful at my Grams' memorial but it looks great in my kitchen today. To me, great staff=repeat business, period. I always do all my FedEx and copy business through this center. ",0,0,0,0,1

 GREAT DINNER! We were a little apprehensive with the Circus Circus location as it is more of a 'low-rent' casino but trusted the positive rating here on yelp and are happy we did. Everyone's meal was cooked to order and delicious (tough to do with some pretty picky eaters in the bunch, including a former steakhouse chef!)

 I'm not all that much of a girly girl, but I will say this: I've learned one of the most important relationships in your life is with your hair stylist. So imagine my devastation when mine moved away 5 years ago. If you've ever had to search for a new salon, you know it's not easy. It's hard to trust a stranger with your hair. (And if you've ever had a bad experience.. it's just that much harder. TWSS) My friend Emilee recommended her stylist: Erica at Salon 42 (the Dilworth location). Emilee has more hair than anyone else I know... so I figured hey, if she can tame that lovely blonde head of hair... she can do anything. :) Erica does a great job. She takes the time for a thorough consultation before pulling out the scissors and dye. I trust her completely and always leave happy. I also recommend Corey. My entire group of girlfriends now go here. I'm pretty sure Emilee's weekly trips are what pays their electric bill. The prices are comparable to other salons in Charlotte.

 If you're looking for a restaurant that has ambience, music, nice lighting and gives you a feeling of being welcomed, don't come here. The prices are not cheap enough to warrant such crappy customer service. And if you're looking for great quality food at affordable prices don't come here either. The food is mediocre at best. This is a walk up to the counter and order. And when your order is ready they simply just yell ""order ready"" The atmosphere is reminiscent of a sad Mexican prison.

 Stopped in with a friend for lunch. The lunch special prices ($7.99) were what really lured us in the door. It was a sadly mediocre experience. You get a lot of food for your money, which I was excited about. But when I started eating my Pad Fresh Ginger, I noticed the flavors were all over the place. One bite was way too salty, another bite was funky. The quality of the chicken seemed to be pretty good, and was plentiful. But overall, it just tasted unpleasant and was very greasy. The lunch special came with a cup of soup and an egg roll. The soup tasted fine, but was only sparsely adorned with vegetables. The eggroll was a greasy, bland little nugget. My friend ordered the Ka Pow, which was equally greasy and underwhelming. Our server was fine, and the space was inviting enough. Too bad the food was pretty forgettable.

 I do not even know where to BEGIN. First.. I did review this place months back after taking my little dog here for a bath and nail trim.. it was $17. (She is 6lbs) All was well. A couple months later I brought my other little dog in for a hair cut. (Shaved all down. He is 6 lbs) it was $17. Last weekend I took BOTH little dogs in... It almost $60. Something didn't add up. I simply stated it seemed higher then the previous times. She said she did not have a record for my 2nd little dog. Weird? Well I do.. I have the bank statement of $17 and a picture I took of him same day leaving their place. The groomer called me later that day and said it bothered her I thought it was more expensive last time and that she would ""check her records..."" And call me back because that ""isnt a way to run a business."" Weird? You told me you didn't have a record for my dog? So. I checked MY banks statements from October (last time he got a cut) $17. I called her back to let her know.. I don't want the $22 back. I just wanted her to know. She said ""I'm sorry! What is your phone number and name again so I can check my records at home for October. I will call you tomorrow!"" Weird? A week later.. Still haven't heard from them. SECOND... The last after my 6 lb dog left there.. Every time you would touch her back she would yelp out of pain. 2 trips to the vet later.. She is now on two antibiotic / steroids for a SKIN INFECTION. Her entire back skin under her fur is basically peeling. It is awful. My vet said this is the second complaint on this groomer. I am not happy and will NEVER take my dogs back here. ",1,0,0,0,0

 You might be surprised...no not really...I hate piano bars. They are right up there with nails on a chalkboard and...oh, yeah...karaoke nights or the ultimate...karaoke only bars. There is nothing worse than forced fun. If you are in a bar and spontaneously sing a song that is playing...great. If it is staged to embarrass people...not so great. So needles to say I arrived with a one star in mind. Atmosphere - crowded yet spacious, slightly older crowd, mostly high tables and chairs, two bar locations, center stage w/ large mirror used for writing silly messages. Service - prompt and friendly. Never really had to wait for a drink. Went to the bar on the first round and used a server after both w/ equal success. Pricing - Similar to other Epicentre establishments ($7 mixed drinks) Piano Playing/ Songs - Songs played consisted of your standard sing-alongs of ""Piano Man"", ""American Pie"", ""Tiny Dancer"", and ""Sweet Caroline"". These songs were played with the dueling pianos but as others have mentioned there is support from a drummer and a keyboard player, which is unique to this setting. The musicians will also play requests. Since a majority in attendance w/ me were Steelers fans we got the musicians to play an excellent version of ""Renegade"" by Styx (a Heinz Field staple). They also played a surprisingly interesting take on Wiz khalifa Steelers theme song ""Black and Yellow"". Overall - Despite the fact that I dislike piano bars and the place did not have the same cozy feel that I prefer of say a Mr Smith's in DC, I had a good time. This was mostly due to the company and the musicians willingness to play anything requested...and play it well. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I had my appendix out last year. Which was nice. I was gutted though, I wanted an awesome scar and instead I got three tiny ones. Overshare? Bloody modern keyhole surgery. Anyway, I'm not here to talk about that - obviously the surgery was a total success and I was cured. I'm going to talk about my experience of the Western General. I was only there for three nights, yet I was moved to four different rooms. That means I was moved twice in one day. That just happened to be the day after surgery when I was in a lot of pain and didn't really want to be disturbed. I understand if they need to move you, but it seemed a bit excessive. Also, there is NOTHING to do! There are no TVs, no reading material. I asked the nurse if she could possibly get me a paper. She brought me back Heat. Great. Just great. I mean, I learnt a lot about Katie Price but it went straight into my slipstream of vacuous crap. And the food was hospital food. So all in all, it was a pretty lousy experience.

 I genuinly feel sorry for anyone who left our wedding before we cut the cake. They have NO IDEA what they missed! Piece of Cake was wonderful from the start and they certainly lived up to the name. Our first meeting entailed looking at pictures, laughing and more importantly, tasting cake. The steps on deciding were easy and the only bad thing was that we didn't have enough people at our wedding to earn us a third tier.. so we had to cut back one of our options. Sad, sad day, indeed. Our final cake was white almond cake on the bottom (there's just a hint of almond which gives the flavor depth) with almond buttercream and the top was mocha cake with caramel buttercream. The top layer didn't last through the night it was so delicious. There was some almond cake left, which we enjoyed thoroughly over the few days after the wedding that it lasted. It's my understanding that Piece of Cake will remake the top tier of the cake for the 1st Anniversary (way better than frozen cake) but we aren't that far yet, so I can't say for sure. I'm looking forward to finding out though. Yum! ",0,0,0,0,1

Then after finding it was out of stock, went to customer service who told me to go back to the last guy I talked to about ordering it and getting further information about it, and all he told me was that if I wanted to order it from the store I have to go to the website from my phone and order it there. SO in conclusion, I just wasted time and gas coming down to this store. And before heading down here I was on hold for 15 minutes on my phone and decided to hangup because no one answered it. If I choose to buy something from them it will be an online purchase. Fuck this place. First and last time here. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Just your typical franchised boba tea place with the additional Taiwanese style appetizers menu. It is located in ""Chinatown"" with at least 2 other boba tea stores in the same stripmall. It can be crowded or fairly empty depending on when you decide to visit. The bobas are cooked well, so that is always a good sign. But the drinks are almost always prepared from powder, unless they are running some seasonal promotions. My favorite item to order here is the popcorn chicken. It is super good and usually seasoned just right when freshly prepared. But what is not to like with most deep fried snacks. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've been here twice, first time got the wonton soup, which was pretty decent. Nothing too special or fancy though we did have a question of if they were using the microwave to heat food up. We're still not sure! The second time, I got the beef noodle soup (I think that's what it was called, it was the first one on the menu), got it spicy and with thick noodles! It was pretty good, the noodles were cooked just right (at least for me), it wasn't too spicy just enough to taste it, and the beef was very tender (it came apart very easily!). I believe it was $7.99 for that. My friend got the beef and tendon, spicy, and with thick noodles as well. I believe he liked it as well. Well it wasn't bad for either of us, so that's a plus. It's worth a try, I still need to try some other items on the menu. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I ordered delivery for my order. I ordered Chicken Satay, Drunken Noodle w/chicken, Fried Tofu w/mushrooms, and the Crispy Duck Dinner. The food smelled amazing when it was delivered, and this was my first time trying Thai BBQ. Sadly, it was a mixed bag when it came too living up to the smell. If by Crispy Duck they mean over cooked, with the only flavor being one of stale or mishandled meat. I could not eat the duck at all. Chicken Satay is usually one of my favorite Thai dishes, but this chicken somehow managed to be both tough and undercooked. Not sure how they managed that. The saving graces for Thai BBQ were the Drunken Noodle w/chicken, which was delicious and flavorful, as was the Fried Tofu w/mushrooms. If I ever order from Thai BBQ again, I think I'll stick to the BBQ chicken everyone raves about, and the dishes I just mentioned. No more expensive experimentation for me. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We ate here when they first opened and the service was atrocious. The server spilled a full glass of ice water on my companion. I read the reviews that continued to complain about service but I was really hoping that we might catch the staff on a good night. There were no blatant offenses, but even though there were only a few tables occupied in the entire restaurant, the server kept bringing food to our table that the table next to us ordered, and taking all of our food to them. The table next to us was more annoyed than we were, and shook their heads in frustration and said no that's theirs. It seems like the server was totally spaced out. The food itself was good. We ordered from the happy hour menu, which is quite reasonable. We got Gyoza, calamari, snow white roll, salmon nigiri, tuna nigiri and a lovely fresh salad from the sushi chef. I wish they would do some training so that The service wasn't so bad. ",0,0,0,1,0

 As full time RIvers who really like Thai food it's often difficult to find ""good"" Thai food.

We found this restaurant not far off the 10 in Chandler which has recently opened. The service was very friendly. Pricing was very good.The restaurant was very clean and welcoming.

 Three words: CHICKEN AND WAFFLES!! Two More: EAT HERE! I'd heard of Grand Lux being a Cheesecake Factory owned chain, and saw one last weekend in L.A off of Wilshire. I yelped 24 hour restaurants in Vegas and the second one that shows up was this one. We arrived at 11:45 p.m this past Thursday and everyone from the hostess that answered our questions on the phone to the bus boy that gave us water was nice, professional, and attentive!! It's hard to find good food and excellent service during normal hours of the day let alone at midnight! Only in Vegas, I guess. Our waitress was so nice and gave us some suggestions on what clubs are hot at the moment. We loved it so much we went back the next night at around 10 p.m. (would've gone three days in a row, but no time!)and same deal except this time we noticed they offered chicken and waffles on their menu. GOURMET CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! TAKE THAT ROSCOES!! For dessert we got a dozen pecan chocolate chip cookies to go for something around $6.00 and they were made fresh!! You can't beat that!! Grand Lux is better than Cheesecake Factory! Trust, I went to one at Caesar's and everyone there thought they were too good to work there or threw their dirty laundry with other workers out in the open with us. Not classy. I urge you not to waste your money or time on crap late night food cafes that over charge you for undercooked food and bad service. Grand Lux is better than Cheesecake Factory! ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place has great sales pitches and good on customer service until you sign on the dotted line. After that it is all downhill from there! They have horrible customer service and are not willing to work with you or give any leway on returning the items. If you decide to rent something from them for an event make sure you only rent one because the items they will send don't match! Our event was on a Sunday so when we saw the items didn't match there was nothing we could do because they were closed. The company took no ownership or responsibility for this issue and didn't seem to care. Do not recommend them at all! Besides, their prices are really not very good. We founf it cheaper to purchase a chocolate fountain than to rent one from them. Party City, sam's Club and Costco are all cheaper. Do not use this company. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Buckle up, Mezzo Bistro. Here it comes. I'd give you a ZERO rating, but since that isn't possible, you'll earn a completely undeserved one star. 10/30/2013, about 11:30 a.m. My wife and I go in for lunch, order a Caesar salad and two entrees. The salad comes out, and to be honest, it's pretty good. Then, my wife finds a PUSHPIN in her salad. Are you f**king kidding me? A PUSHPIN? She spits it out (lucky - for you - that she wasn't injured), and I call the only staff member I can find over. (A blonde woman working behind the bar.) We show this to her, and she quickly apologizes and goes back into the kitchen. For a while. My wife, visibly shaken, isn't really comforted by the half-hearted apology and disappearing act. The woman eventually came back out and went straight behind the bar, obviously having no intention of speaking to us again. No manager or chef came out to check on us either. So we left. BTW: Y'all can keep the groupon voucher we handed her at the beginning of the meal - it's a pretty safe bet we're never eating there again. I don't know how the hell you have your kitchen and prep areas set up, but how the hell do you prep food anywhere near pushpins? You didn't see any possibility that this could eventually cause a problem? No? I will say that this wasn't our first time there. In fact, it was probably our 6th or 7th time in. And all the other times, I left happy with my meals. But never again. I don't care how many good meals you serve, one ""I-could-have-been-seriously-injured-by-your-carelessness and ineptitude"" is all it takes. I realize there's probably not much you can do to satisfy a customer that was one swallow away from spending the rest of the day in the ER because of your stupidity, but here's a tip: DON'T RUN AWAY AND HIDE FROM THEM EITHER. Way to run a business, guys. So go ahead and try your luck at Mezzo Bistro, people. It is Vegas, after all, so if you feel like gambling with your life, knock yourself out. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I was in Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale visiting college friends with the New Boy and celebrating the New Year holiday. On New Year day, we dragged ourselves out of bed around 2:00 or 3:00 and heading to Mill Ave because we were STARVING. Ra seemed like a good choice, so we struck in and found ourselves sitting on the back patio--the music inside was just WAY too loud. Our waitress made sake-bomb-action happen, which was a blessed relief. That was the best part of the experience. The sushi was *ok*, the service sucked, and the ambiance was weird. We waited for over 30 minutes for our bill...I was about to walk out without paying just because I was tired of the place. The overly-loud music varied between classic rock and dance music...they should have just left it on the dance music and left Cheap Trick and Foreigner at home. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The first time I went, I thought maybe they just had an off day. I wasn't impressed. It must have been a year between that first visit and the second. Well, it was during that second visit I remembered why in the hell I waited a year to return. First of all, the service was less than average. I'm all for authentic Mexican food, but my server was so difficult to understand, and understand me, I was wondering if I actually had been transported south of the border. It was NOT busy when we were there, but we were constantly looking for someone to help with the many issues we had during our meal. They screwed up my kids burrito, (how tough is it to NOT serve it enchilada style). My other son ordered beef tacos, he loves tacos, took one bite and was like YUCK! I said seriously, it can't be that bad, so I - being the dad who was raised not to waste food took a taste. - YUCK is right. How can you screw up ground beef? Well, I suppose if you can't serve a burrito plain, ground beef is way to tough to cook and season properly. I ordered off the healthy menu and the piece of meat that came out on my plate would have made a nice treat for my Labrador, but not for me. Now maybe it was because I waited 5 minutes before trying my steak that caused it to suck so bad - but I was hoping to get my son a new meal, (which never happened btw) because by the time the waiter came back, my boy was so stuffed on chips and salsa, he didn't want anything else. AND - the drinks were never refilled or topped off. AND - they didn't even offer to take the tacos off my bill. Hmmm. Customer satisfaction 101 me thinks??? All in all, I will NOT be going back here.

 Disappointing would be the right word. In my book hash is not hash unless it's crispy. And this was not. At all. Mush would be a better term. A slapped together, ring molded monstrosity of boiled chicken, rock hard poached egg and sad sauce. The chilaquiles weren't much better. Three stacked blue corn toastadas, some mozzarella and an eggy hockey puck does not a fine chilaquile make. Where's my comfort food of cotija cheese and spicy sauce soaked chips? Where's the breakfast of champions, of hungover warriors and Vegas-ites ready for a Bobby Flay throwdown meal? Not here apparently. The coffee was the best part.

 Wanting a quick bite and decided to try something new. Never been here before and was wow'd the first time walking in. Never expect this contemporary d \ u00e9cor when enjoying Asian/ Vietnamese food. The wood all around the restaurant, multi leveled, and the beautiful 10-12 seat bar was warm and welcoming, the aroma around the restaurant made us hungry, I was very excited to see what they had to offer. After still talking about the d \ u00e9cor, the server arrived promptly with menus and the specials of the day. I was excited to try the entire menu, but settled on Pho Tai Nam. Yes, it's about 98 degrees that day and I decide I wanted hot soup, don't judge!! My friend ordered the Belly Buns. Although, I did not get a chance to try her dish, she couldn't stop talking about how good it was. My soup was awesome, what was great about the dish was the after part. After having Pho, at some places, I become growingly thirsty, not so much with District One's pho. It was full of flavor, right about of onions, and did not have whatever component that makes you thirsty. Kuddos!! I am excited to see this place make it big, very different concept. The food was definitely fusion, I mean where can you get fish tacos and chicken wings at any other Vietnamese restaurants. I love the marrying of different flavors, cultures, and ingredients; the unpretentiousness, that is what food is all about. Sure, this visit was brief, but I will definitely be back to try it out again and again. Next time, I'll bring more reinforcements and will venture into the King Crab, Oysters, and the Down and Dirty options! Can't wait! Great job, great first impression!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Trader Joes is a fresh, cheap take on over-priced local grocery stores. The produce is not only cheaper, but larger and riper than the other grocery stores. Their brand name almond milk and peanut butter is one of the main reasons I keep coming back. The only downside to this hip-style of grocery shopping is both the parking and the narrowness of the aisles. Crammed is the best word to describe a Sunday afternoon trip to T.J. Both the parking and the traveling from aisle to aisle is an absolute hot mess. Obviously the location and parking cannot improve, but my advice is for them to open a new store near Southend...closer to a wider space...where I can walk to. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I had tried Pinkberry when it first opened on the Strip and really, really liked it. However, as of recently I've discovered another froyo place by my house and I have to say, I prefer the other one. Yes, Pinkberry tastes pretty fresh but I could taste some artificial flavors in it. The employees are super nice and will give you as many samples as you like. I always go for original tart, with some berries on top. It is a tad bit expensive though for such a little cup. Either way, if you are on the Strip and are looking for something light and refreshing, sans alcohol, this is a good place to stop in for a treat. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Let me start off by saying this review is for people who don't particularly like Asian cuisine, but are forced to come here due to some type of obligation. The place is decked out in bright red Asian decor, with a lit up waterfall flowing in the background. I came here with a group celebrating an important occasion, and the guest of honor chose this place. I was a little skeptical after hearing the name, but there was plenty here for those who don't enjoy this type of food. Even though we were seated for teppanyaki style dining, I ordered the Angus Beef Sirloin and Black Truffle Teriyaki with fried rice. The black truffle and teriyaki sauce added a very good flavor to what was a pretty ordinary piece of meat. Also, I didn't think rice could be this good: adding eggs and seasoning to it, really made this side a nice surprise. While I was a little shocked at first about the prices, the decor and the chef's performance at the table helped to ease my pain....The delicious food helped too. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The Yelp reviews here are way, WAY off. They have gone through a change in management and name, although the signage on the outside still says Greek Grill. My husband and I were hoping for some authentic Turkish food since it's impossible to find in the valley. Instead, we got flat-out terrible food. My husband got lamb kafta that was pulled straight from the freezer. I got a vegetarian plate that had an inedible spinach pie. It tasted very old and dried out. The stuffed grape leaves were ok, but even the canned ones from Trader Joe's taste better. The falafel was absolutely the worst falafel that my husband and I have ever tasted. There were no visible spices or onions in the patty. So horribly bland other than the taste of old oil. My husband's Turkish coffee was nothing like we had in Turkey. It wasn't bad, but it was more like chai than the dark tar that is turkish coffee. We usually like to try baklava at Mediterranean restaurants in hopes of finding something close to what we had in Turkey, but we didn't want to risk further disappointment. The service was friendly though, and that's the only thing keeping me from giving them one star. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Happened upon this restaurant while staying at a nearby hotel. We drove by earlier in the day and were first interested in the unique architecture of the building. The decor inside was fun and had an old-school feel. Lots of pink and green, neon lights, mirrors, and wall murals. I loved it! Went in for dinner a little late, still being on west coast/vacation time, but there were still quite a few people and we weren't rushed at all. Our server was very friendly and helpful when we asked about the menu, even though she needed to check with the kitchen on some of our particular needs. We started with two margaritas and the Espinaca con queso. Unfortunately it was missing spinach. Hmm... There were some green chiles, however, that added to the cheese dip. I ordered a beef chimichanga with their famous baja sauce. OH how I love this white, creamy, spicy sauce!! Maybe a spicy sour cream? It was delicious! Hubby got steak fajitas which were good, but believe it or not, I was hooked on the grilled onions! They were so flavorful! I'm glad there were a lot on his platter so I could steal more than a few.

 my boyfriend recommended my friends and i go here because it's one of his favorite clubs in vegas. i loved the outdoor patio area by the pool. i liked the fact that if it got too stuffy or we needed a break from dancing we could just go outside by the pool to get a nice nighttime breeze or drinks. they had a bar out there as well as some poker tables if anyone wanted to gamble. the ambience was nice. the club got easily crowded on the dance floor though. that's one thing i didn't particularly like, having gotten drinks poured down my back due to people bumping into each other. seriously...not even enough elbow room, but seeing as it was the night before new years 2012. but considering it was the night before new years eve, getting in only costed us 30 bucks for girls and i think 50 for guys which wasn't as bad as i thought it would have been. they threw us some light sticks at the club and it was a fun atmosphere.

 On a spontaneous trip to Vegas with the BF, we were expecting to get into vegas at 2am. What is there decent to eat in Vegas at that time? Steak and eggs? Mmmmh, not in the mood for it. Earl's? Not againnn. So we started yelping for oysters since I've heard of some pretty bomb oyster places in LV and came upon this place. What the hell is a pan roast? Tomato based with seafood?! We are so there. We got there and waited about 15 minutes to be seated. That is the only bad part about this place--too little seats, too high in demand. It is not an eat and run type of place, if you don't have about an hour or two--this isn't the place for you. We ordered the pan roast level 6---and a year later, we still come here for pan roast when we're in town. We've gotten most of our family and friends addicted to this place too. I don't suggest coming during peak times if you have a big party, AND if you do have a big party--expect to wait. We came here once with 6 friends and waited more than an hour just so we can have seats next to each other. The food is cooked in front of you and service can be a tad slow Side note--you can't call in for to-go orders. Even if you want to take it to-go you have to go there and wait in line (yes I've tried.) ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've only eaten here once but it was quite good. My husband and I both had the veggie burger and split an order of half/half fries.

 I was in the area with a friend & we wanted pizza...After checking my Yelp app, we chose this pizzeria because it was the closest to where we were. It's very small (setup primarily for take out), but it does have some tables in the back. After placing our order at the front counter, a large pepperoni pizza & anti pasta dish, we were disappointed to find that they don't sell any beer! We waited for our pizza a little longer then I would've expected and on top of that we got our pizza first, before our antipasta dish. We had to ask about our antipasta dish, so I suspect they forgot. I'm sorry to say that we both felt that the pizza was just average, we liked the antipasta better. Being from the SF area, we've definitely had our share of good pizza and we were both disappointed. Furthermore, service was not their strength at all, but then again they are set-up more for take-out/delivery. In addition, I agree with other comments that it's pricey for what I consider to be very standard pizza. I wish I had gone a little further to New York Pizza & Pasta on Jones & Sahara (which I feel has delicious pizza). ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've realised just how much I dislike pet stores! I haven't been in too many so I can't compare Dofos (funny name) to other stores of the like, but the birds and rodents they had in cages brought out the inner PETA activist in me. I mean, I'm not going vegetarian or anything crazy like that, but it is quite sad to see animals confined to such a small space. Rant aside, I .. suppose... Dofos is alright for pet food, as they seemed to have an extensive amount of the stuff! They also had several cats slurking about as well as the cutest little kittens for sale. It wasn't really my cup of tea, but if you have animals that need feeding I suppose this is the place to go. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Items Ordered: Sliced Brisket, Pulled Pork, Spare Ribs, Cornbread Mac n' Cheese Sweet Potato Fries Biscuit ""New Orleans"" French Toast with Sliced Bananas Banana Pudding Red Velvet Cake Praline Located near Norm's Eggs Caf \ u00e9 in a strip mall off South Durango and featuring ""World Famous"" ribs with awards in 2007 and 2010 for the city's best barbeque it was with tempered expectations that I entered TC's Rib Crib and although I will say the Motown soundtrack and service were quite pleasant as I watched the Buckeyes obliterate Kent State, little else of my experience was even remotely good - a small, buttery biscuit and a jumbo praline the lone exception.

Mostly ignoring bland elbow noodles from which I consumed only a few bites and fries that arrived almost at meal's end as well as the $4.50 French Toast was flat and flavorless even with the $1.50 banana and whipped cream upgrade...the latter not supplied as they were apparently 'out'...and moving on to dessert, suffice it to say that the boxed vanilla pudding with only a hint of banana beneath 'nilla wafers is not worth $5.99 and although the frosting on a tiny sliver of red velvet cake was tangy and smooth the cake was so dry it literally crumbled to fork pressure - the majority of it joining nearly half the rest of my order in a waste basket when servers were otherwise occupied so as not to offend. Literally the only patron present just past noon on a Saturday it is shocking to me that a business like TC's can sustain and as much as I try to support locals I cannot fathom a reason to return, particularly given a pricepoint higher than Rollin' Smoke despite quality on par with Famous Dave's.

 Found this place from Yelp (yay!) under ""vegetarian sushi"". It just happened to be the closest sushi place between South Point (where I was staying) and the Strip (where I didn't want to be driving at that point). Cute little place with awesome owners who also happened to be our waiters! It's a very small place, but there was hardly anyone there, and when we sat down, the owner basically said, ""you've never been here before, huh?"" which I thought was really cool. There were some locals there chatting to the sushi chefs - also cool. :) The highlight of Miko's is that they have an ENTIRE menu devoted to vegetarian and vegan sushi. *drools* Basically, anything on the menu had a vegetarian/vegan alternative, something I appreciate very, very much. My partner and I tried a few things: agedashi roll (tofu and veggies), vegetarian Hawaiian roll, tempura, miso soup, and California roll. The flavors of everything we ate were fabulous, the avocado in the rolls was fresh, and the rolls didn't taste ""fishy"" like at some places. It was also extraordinarily cheap for a sushi place, considering our meal only cost us about $30 for all that. I guess that's fair-priced. The food was great - not the *best* sushi I've ever had, but well worth trying again. It was also awesome that they were open super late, since I didn't get around to eating dinner until 9. ;) ",0,0,0,1,0

 The Monte Carlo in Vegas is not nearly as nice as the real place but it's an okay Hotel on the strip. It's kind of inbetween the worst and the nicest hotels. I've walked through it a couple times but there's nothing really I can recall that catches the eye. It's a pretty simple place and it has lower limits if you want to gamble smaller here instead of the high minimums of some of the other hotels such as Caesars, or Bellagio. It gets three stars.

 Its hard to tell whether the staff is so rude because of the rude customers they deal with or the customers are so rude because of the staff they have to deal with. Which came first?

 I love that Wingzza has a sauce named after our NBA team...I had 5 Hornets for lunch and they were just as described, a balance between honey and hot! Lots of reviews point to the mambo (spelling?) sauce. I ate one of these as well and loved a couple of things that I want to point out: 1). The ""viscosity"" of the mambo sauce was just right. 2). The mambo sauce reminded me of a very well executed Polynesian sauce...MMMMM! The Hornet sauce was not quite as thick and a little hotter than mambo. This flavor is my favorite, but I do wish the viscosity of this sauce was thicker to be aligned with that of the mambo sauce. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We booked through Advantage via Orbitz because of the lower price knowing full well that the agents would be asking us to take the insurance and full tank option. Now, normally I can deal with the sale-sy agents and their jedi minds tricks like when they ask ""would you like to take the basic coverage or the premium coverage?"" They don't even give you the option to decline coverage. But this time, the agent flat out lied about the gas option. He told me that we could bring the tank full and have the gas option credited which is total BS, but the way he explained it, I bought it hook, line and sinker. I should have asked him to put it in writing and to write his name down. Or I should have recorded the conversation with my phone. He would have scurried away like the rat he is. Luckily, I figured out that he was lying before we returned the car and got gas. I read the contract to double check what he said was true. It states that no refund given for partial full tank. With that knowledge and the face that we used over 3/4th of the tank, I decided not to fill the tank. When we got back to the car rental drop off, I asked the guy who inspected the car if he had ever heard of the refund for the gas option. Obviously he did not. After dropping off the car, I went looking for the agent to tell him in his face that he was a LIAR!! Lucky for him & the company he wasn't there. Know what you need from car rental places before you get to the counter. Check with YOUR insurance company and know what they will cover on rental cars...typically they have the coverage you need already. No need to waste the extra $10 a day with the car rental companies. Reject the full tank gas option if you know you'll have time to gas up...you really have to get down to a low amount of gas to make the full tank option worth it even with the lower price on gas that they offer. If you know you won't have the 5-10 minutes to gas up, I guess it would be worth it too. Bottom line is that I might rent from Advantage in the future but if they pull something like this again, I'm recording the conversation and sending it to whatever consumer protection department I need to.

 **Summary** - Prices - Their prices are pretty steep for the amount and quality you get. Their New Day Combo has 2 bacon strips, 2 eggs, and a tasteless french toast for $7.99. Other places you can get that plus hash browns for $5. - Taste - The only redeemable thing about the entire meal was that the breakfast sandwich itself was pretty good. This is the first breakfast place I've seen that screwed up seasoned potatoes. - Lag - It was decently packed when we got in and didn't get out food for about 40 minutes. - Service - The waitress came over three times during my entire visit there. Once to take orders, another to return with the food, and lastly to drop off the check. I didn't expect much service, but that's just ridiculous. I didn't even get a refill on my drink. **Ordered** - $7.99 Breakfast Sandwich - Bagel sandwich was pretty good, but the seasoned potatoes weren't seasoned well and undercooked (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ea04rGA3H-ZqY1nHLpI2FQ?select=Sp5Q6ZCE92FTaTcT47WCKg). - $7.99 New Day Combo - You get very little for what they call their signature combo. The french toast was lacking flavor and was simply sub par (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ea04rGA3H-ZqY1nHLpI2FQ?select=lRBRvqm2oKC8fwYMaEBPaQ). **Recommendations** - I would definitely not recommend this place. Your local IHOP would have better food and at lower prices. I would of given this place a one star had it not been for the bagel sandwich. ",0,1,0,0,0

 While on this side of town taking care of some errands, I suggested this place to hubby since we were passing by it anyway. I have eaten here many times in the past but it had been a while so I was curious to see what had changed if anything. They now have a ""Coasta Cantina Express"" which is right where you walk in to be seated in the actual restaurant. If you don't want to eat inside this gives you the option to just grab it to-go. I would think you could just order it to-go from inside the restaurant the same but maybe people don't think about that and having the express makes them realize that they want a taco. The express menu is limited compared to the menu inside but has the standard favorites. You can choose tacos, burritos, salads, rice bowls, quesadillas, nachos, soda, water and it wouldn't be Vegas unless they sold beer and they do that too. $4 a beer! Eating inside gets you free chips, salsa & bean dip but if you want it from the express it is going to cost you $3.50 (no beans just chips & salsa) and $1.95 if you want to add rice and beans to your order. Now that I was finished being nosy about the express option I decided eating inside would be better for us. We were seated right away and had our drink orders taken. The person bringing us refills was spot on he was quick to refill our chips & salsa or ask if we needed anything but our server lacked a lot of things. It took her 15 minutes for her to even come over and see us and then 5 more minutes until she came back to take our order. We finished 2 rounds of chips & salsa before she came over to us. They weren't very busy at all so I don't know what the deal was. The chips & salsa are good and the bean dip is amazing. It tasted just like I remembered it. When it came to the main course I ordered the ""Cheese Enchiladas"" made with flour tortillas. It came with a side of beans (I know I said it but the beans are so tasty!) and rice. It wasn't terrible at all but it wasn't spectacular. I think it could be due to the fact that the plate wasn't very warm when it arrived. I was able to get it for $7.99 after I showed my players card. Currently if you have a players card then on weekdays before 6 pm you can get a 2 item combo for just $7.99. My meal would have been $11 with out the deal. Score! Hubby ordered a ""Shredded Beef Burrito"" priced at $12 and had it smothered for 99 cents more. He enjoyed it and found the size to be good but again the food was sorta cold. This could have been easily given more stars by me if the server did her job and if the food wasn't on the cold side. I will more then likely leave this location to the tourists and stick to the location closer to my home. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Sat outside on the ""wall of fire"" patio. Nice and cozy & warm.

 Man...what potential. We stopped by before Black Sabbath since KDKB was doing a remote and contest for front row seats. There was also a diamondbacks game that night as well....as you may know that's quite busy for downtown. We stayed on the patio since it was nice out. As far as we could tell there was only one server for the entire area. I really felt bad for this girl. She was busting her butt trying to serve people but the frustration showed and I don't blame her. How could management staff a place like that? Maybe they had a number of call outs or no shows that day who knows. But it was bad. We got some happy hour food which took forever and a day to get. The bacon wrapped shrimp seemed pretty good. You get four decent sized shrimp wrapped in bacon and a decent sauce. Only half my shrimp had bacon wrapped on them, but hey who's counting. And I wasn't going to make that poor waitress more miserable. The nachos looked good enough, I didn't try them but how can you screw them up? We should've thought ahead and saved that server time and helped her by ordering say four drinks at a time. The time we spent there, over an hour, we were only able to order one drink each. And that was a stretch. My friends got their beers and ten minutes later I got my greyhound. Again....this has nothing to do with the server! She was really trying. I blame management for not taking advantage of double events that night AND a radio station on site. It shouldn't be that hard. The place seemed like it would be good and maybe on a non-event day I would go to see if that's true. If you go on event days just plan on waiting.....eating with your hands since you apparently get no napkins or dinnerware and flagging down the food runner who is asking every table if the food is their order. We watched it go by a few times and thought wow.....these guys are so disorganized. Legends.....in bad management. ",1,0,0,0,0

 As a child (along with Burger King), Kentucky Fried Chicken (as it was called then), was my favorite fast food restaurant. You couldn't go wrong with the ""Original Recipe"" (only option back then... it was just called chicken because there was no ""Extra Crispy"") and mashed potatoes. Sure the coleslaw made me vomit through my nose (just wasn't ready for it then), but Kentucky Fried Chicken was the best. Years later, ""Extra Crispy"" became available and I realized how hard the ""Original Recipe's"" texture sucked! Novelty drove me to KFC yesterday. I went with the white meat combo ... ""Extra Crispy"". I started with the chicken. The batter was really caked on. I forgot haw thick the layers of batter get with KFC. My initial bite started off satisfying, the flavors helped me relive those great fast foodie moments of my childhood. From there, the mirage took off. The batter is caked on so thickly that there is a space between the chicken and the crispy exterior that's moist mush. It was so disgusting, I could only eat select portions of the batter I knew were crisp. The chicken was so far from free-range, it tasted as if were raised in a can. The breast was moist, but it oddly had the flavor and some of the texture of thigh meat (I can't stand dark meat chicken). I went with the wedges. They are flavored like curly fries, but with twice the seasoning. The first part of the bite was solid, but the guts of the wedges were a mushy potato with the consistency of mashed potatoes -- yeah, deep-fried mashed potatoes --- %&u% GROSS! The only thing I finished here was the soda. I hope in 10 years, when I consider coming back, I read this review and realize some things are best left in childhood. ",1,0,0,0,0

 There was talk of a Lobster claw machine. I suspect that, and the low low price, is why my husband chose this pit. First impression: the parking garage, how are there shoe prints on the celling? Then onto the elevators. Small. clanky. It's and older place, no biggie. Enter to the 'lobby' old old carpet, old old wallpaper. To be expected, its an old place. There is a bar up ahead, oh that's nice. Oh, it's shut down. And covered in dust. Some temporary looking walls create a massive box in the middle of this area, it seems to house old machines. That's odd. I guess they are under construction... or something? Check in is back behind the elevators. It takes forever. Up to the room. We call for more pillows, don't expect delivery. Walk your happy butt back down to the lobby and get it yourself. I am now confronted with the reality of the room. This is where I will be sleeping. Sometimes, you just do not want to know. You touch as little as possible and sleep on top of the sheets. It is now clear, booking here was a terrible mistake. And you know what's good when you are drunk? A toilet that doesn't work. You know what's better? Needing water, remembering the soda machine near the elevator... oh, its out of water... and Gatorade... and soda... its out of everything. So you go, to EVERY floor. Guess what? they are all out! Hungover me loves multiple consecutive short, jerking elevator rides, and disappointment. It seems someone is unable to pay the Pepsi guy. My guess: this joint is going under. The casino sucks, the infamous lobster claw is gone, though I can see exactly where it was as I'm guessing they haven't vacuumed that spot since it was removed. The bar is shut down, the restaurant is shut down, the only think open is a place to buy jerky. Jerky. Good god this place is bad. I wont miss it. We spent as little time as possible here. We spent most of our time at the newly renovated Plaza, where the Casino doesn't suck, the restaurants are actually operational, and our friends got a killer room for barely more than what we paid.

 The girl who never, never, NEVER clubs went to a club. Long story short I had a group of girls/cousins come into Las Vegas for a bachelorette party. They needed a club to go to on Monday night - Marquee is open on Monday night - 1 star! On Yelp I asked for some help to find a promoter/host for a club on a Monday night and I was referred to Gia Lee at Marquee - found her on Facebook and got all 17 girls into the club, VIP line, with open bar from 10 pm to 11 pm - 1 more star! Although I am NOT a club-goer (I used to be) I do LOVE The Cosmopolitan, and since I have high expectations for places in the Cosmo, Marquee was no exception. And Marquee delivered. I loved the look and layout of the club, plenty of accessible bars, an outside and indoor dancing area. The pool part of the club was especially my favorite. 1 more star! My complaint #1 is the same complaint for ALL Las Vegas clubs; even with being guest listed my group STILL had to wait in a line. It's just annoying. I wish they would stream-line the process. If I'm going through a promoter, why can't she just walk me in? Why do I have to deal with the club-thugs (as I like to call them)? *sigh* I guess it's all part of the ""experience"". Complaint #2 and this is a big one. When I went to leave the club I left by myself. I went directly to the elevators that I had come up in. The club-thugs at the elevators pointed me to a flight of stairs. WHAT. THE. F*CK. Yes, the profanity is definitely needed. ARE YOU KIDDING ME, MARQUEE? How dare your club-thugs make me use a flight of stairs in high-heels and drunk. Even at The Palms they let you take the elevator back down (yes, it is many more stories), but STILL. That needs to stop immediately. If it weren't for that ending I probably would have given 4-stars. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Went to Flemings for a friend's birthday. What really sent a red flag off was the waiter's offhand comment that the menu was a ""conventional steak house."" Now don't get me wrong conventional is good in my book, nothing beats the simplicity of meat and potatoes. What's wrong is charging luxury prices for food that simply doesn't warrant such a price tag. I'm fine eating a $50 Steak, but what makes it worth $50? Is it organic? Grass Fed? A new innovation on the greatest meat to ever grace this earth? Flemings just says it's wet or dry aged, aging beef is a necessity not anything to brag about. I can cook a beautiful steak from Costco for 8 bucks a pound, Flemings is too expensive at that price. My friends ordered it, they enjoyed it, from what I sampled it tasted fine. But $50 fine? No F****** WAY! And the steaks were a la carte too, which is just ridiculous, if you're paying $50 for a steak give the customer a baked potato. The sides (including potatoes) were priced from the $10-$15 range which just stings because now you're certainly paying $60 for your entree. The sides are marketed as ""Family Style"" but it'd only give a nice portion split between 3 people. I ordered the Fleming's Salad ($10) and their New Zealand Lamb Chops ($20), and I'm simply baffled at what I was served. When I order a ""Steakhouse Salad"" I expect something of large proportions. After all a salad with no protein costs a restaurant practically nothing (and none of their food was labeled GMO-Free or Organic). What I received was a little salad, something that would leave a little girl wanting for more. To add insult to injury the dressing was too sweet for my tastes, no acids besides what the baby tomatoes would give. I was pretty buzzed and wolfed it down anyway. When I ordered Lamb Chops I was alerted by the server that it indeed was a little plate of food, I didn't care because I was not paying $30 for chicken breasts. It was small but decent, unfortunately it was given to me at room temperature meaning it had been sitting while my friends orders were made. Come on guys for twenty bucks you can wrap my little chops with some foil! The meal wasn't all bad, the wine served was great, and I loved the deserts, all complements to pastry chef. The servers were courteous. But after being buzzed on wine we were given the ultimate rude awakening with our bill, for a party of 6 our total was around $700 (not including tip). Now to be fair we ordered $250 worth of drinks. But still we were NOT given $450 worth of food, no way in hell can steak, potatoes, lamb, and lobster cooked conventionally cost $450. Now I know what you might be thinking, well this is Sin City, you gamble and spend a lot here. Well I can take you to ""Mon Ami Gabi"" at Paris and sit outside with a stunning view of the Bellagio Fountains for far less than the price of going to Flemings. I can take you to Bouchon and have the most lovely salad, entree, dessert and wine for roughly $100 a person. Flemings was conventional, there was nothing technically wrong with the food. But at the end of the day we were horribly overcharged, their only gift was a $25 gift card (which we sadly couldn't apply to the bill) and a small box of chocolate truffles. Unless you have a 50% off coupon do not go to Flemings, it simply is not worth it and there are far better choices in Las Vegas. And this is Sin City, why would you want ""conventional"" in this town? If you want a real good steakhouse you'll get more bang for your buck at the Steakhouse in Circus Circus. ",0,1,0,0,0

 A $150 facial here was by far the worst one I've ever had. The reason I sometimes don't like facials all came true, as the technician spent the whole of the time berating me for not having perfect skin and suggesting ""necessary"" add-ons. The most shocking part, was that their signature ""Glow Facial"" did not even include time with a steam machine or any extractions. The technician seemed to make it her goal to make me feel awful about my skin, even when I politely reminded her that I was there to relax. I went with a friend that felt the same way about her experience. Additionally, the amenities in this spa do not stack up to those in other Strip spas, and the place lacks an aura of grace that leads to a calming ambiance. Cliffs: Arrived excited, left frustrated and feeling like I'd been ripped off, which is especially bad considering this is a business of relaxation. ",1,0,0,0,0

 As cheap as $29.99 or an entire day of eating is, do NOT go to this buffet. I do not think anything there was good, except for the watermelon. Grilled tilapia is somehow breaded. Dessert looks like it was pulled out of a box and placed on a stand. Sushi was still frozen. Put it this way, I did not get any item from the buffet line more than once. They messed up steamed rice. wtf? In case you are wondering how, there were so many hard uncooked rice morsels on my plate. Save your money and eat elsewhere. If you're wondering why I would even eat at a buffet like this after experiencing places like the bellagio or wynn buffet, it is because I was forced to purchase the all-inclusive package for the group I was with. Which is worth it if you actually want to participate in all the stuff they offer, but who really does that while they are in vegas? ",1,0,0,0,0

 If you live or work within the Henderson area, this is not a bad place for Dim Sum, especially if you want to avoid having to drive to Chinatown. Price is comparable, taste is good however it lacks variety. If you like the pineapple bun, order it upon seating so it will be ready by the time you are ready for dessert. It's clean and not greasy.

 The atmosphere is warm and pleasant. Nice patio with heaters if it's even a little cool. Lots of plants outside and a nice fireplace in the main dining room. The crowd tends to be on the mature side. The service is good and friendly, 7 out of 10. The food is pricey. The wine list is extensive, but possibly the most overpriced. Try the $20 wine sampler - 3 half glassesof your choice. The lobster bisque was a little bitter for my taste but my petite wife loved hers and finished mine. The $45 new york strip was ordered medium rare and came out medium, same is true for my wife's beef tenderloin. The presentation was very nice. Despite it being overcooked, it was delicious with a good medley of flavors. Overall, it was good but I'd go elsewhere for the money. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The staff here is friendly and knowledgeable. They seem to know everything about every pet product they carry. Choice Pet Market only gets 4 stars because of their pricing. Most things they carry, I can find some where else for a cheaper price. For example, I was shopping dog strollers the other day. They were asking for $219 for a particular model. Online and at Petsmart, this stroller was only $129. However, I continue to shop here because of the staff and the conveinance. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Best Thai meal I have ever had I can't explain why. I have had Thai that I've liked, and even loved, before. Weera is located in an area with tons and tons of Asian restaurants, so I imagine competition is fierce. All I know is if you are in the area and you choose Weera, you won't be disappointed.

 This is hands down the best doughnut shop around. With a ton of unique styles as well as many of the regular standards everyone is familiar with, there's a ton to choose from. Banana cream, s'mores, peanut butter, pumpkin, and all the other specialty flavors are fantastic. And the regular stuff; jelly, Boston cream; are much better than what you're used to from regular shops. Staff is friendly, open 24 hours on weekends, free doughnuts after certain times on certain days, this place is seriously the best doughnut shop around. ",0,0,0,0,1

 So my new husband and I decided to try out a dim sum place close to the strip because it's a novel idea, dim sum in Vegas! When we got there the place was busy and most patrons were asian, great sign! We were seated right away and got bombarded with carts (of course). Here's a breakdown of what we ended up with: -har gow -shu mai -rice noodles with shrimp -mushroom dumplings -char siu bao (steamed pork bun) -sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf -xiao long bao -scallop dumplings Of what we got here's what I would recommend, xiao long bao, har gow, and mushroom dumplings. The rest where okay and some were not that great. The notable bad dish was the rice noodles with shrimp, which was definitely off. For the noodle dish, usually the shrimp is especially sweet and the noodles are wrapped up but separate. These noodles seemed overcooked because half of the noodles seemed to have fused together. We get darn good dim sum at home, so this was a little bit of a let down. I'm also tempted to take away another star for service because even though we were seated promptly and got our food quickly it took FOREVER to get our bill and after getting it for someone to take it. However, I am in a generous mood so I'll say that they get a 2.5 and round up to 3. Kj Dim Sum will definitely satisfy a dim sum craving, but it's not that great. Not sure what else Vegas has to offer in terms of dim sum, but hopefully it's better than this. Star #1: Flavorful food. Some of them were good, some not so good. Star #2: Food causes cravings. No, not these ones. Star #3: Price worthiness. Yes, decently priced dim sum. Star #4: Decent service. It's okay. Star #5: X factor (ie amazing service, ambiance, creativity, etc). Not really.

 Dear Mr Brenner, I just wanted to let you know that ever since I took my wife to your fine establishment, all she could talk about was your desserts! Let me explain. Some friends of ours told us about your happy hour specials. So we went on a Tuesday night at 9 pm. Once we got to the bar and saw our choices on the happy hour menu, we couldn't make up our minds. We loved the fact that some of the appetizers and desserts are only 6 bucks. Since it was our first time, we decided that a couple hundred more trips should be able to allow us to experience every one of your creations. I decided to go with the Max Brenner Sliders while my wife went for the Philly Sliders. For dessert, we decided to share the S'mores Concoction. We were a bit hungry so we were thinking of ordering some more food after we put our order in. But when our two orders got there, we didn't have to because these ""appetizers"" that we supposedly ordered were pretty much meals by themselves! Both sliders were scrumptious and filling. As for the S'mores Concoction, two words came to mind after tasting it. Rich and Decadent. It's comparable to a person just trying out drugs for the first time and is curious about other drugs. Well, I can say this dessert is the gateway to all the other desserts on your menu! So if you have a sweet tooth, you just might overdose here. So ever since we were there the first time, we have been back several times, even bringing other friends and family with us. If we don't have kids with us, we hit up your 3 to 6 pm or 9 pm to close happy hours at your bar because you have to be 21 and older. So in closing, maybe you should have a chocolate lovers stamp card or something because I know for sure we would have filled up about 2 of them. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I don't agree with the previous review, but we all have our own experiences. I do agree that on some items their prices can be very high. However all of the staff here are super nice, always go out of the way to help me when I come in, whether its locating and item on the shelf, looking one up for me when I have no clue what the heck my technicians at work asked me to get, or even bringing items to my car for me. The store manager Mike is awesome too! I always see Anita or Lenard when I am in there and they are nothing but awesome! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Flying makes me hungry. Actually life makes me hungry, but flying makes me extra hungry. It's hard work sitting on that plane for 4 hours! So as soon as I landed in Phoenix last night I was ready for some grub. Gabi K picked me up from the airport and took me straight to Julio's Too to meet some of her friends for dinner. When we arrived there was a basket of chips and lots of salsa waiting for us...thanks Julio! As I filled up on chips I checked out the menu and was torn between the shrimp fajitas and fish tacos. I decided on the shrimp tacos (as did Gabi) and soon we were greeted with LOTS of food. We probably should have shared, but like I said before...flying makes me hungry. I've had better fajitas in my life, but they were tasty and VERY filling. Of course I managed to eat much more than one of Gabi's friends who's 4 months pregno, but I'll blame my piggyness on the flying. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This is some of the best Indian food I have ever had. The decor is clean and modern, and prices are very inexpensive. My mom and I are visiting Charlotte and came here this evening. The flavors were clean, fresh and delicious - the specific textures and flavors came out in the food, and there was no overpowering spiciness. Our waiter was friendly, had a very relaxed and calm demeanor, and was extremely helpful when it came to ordering. I've had Indian food in a lot of different places and this was honestly the best I can remember having. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Disclaimer: I'm not being fair as I have zero tolerance for food prepared for 200 people sitting in the chafing dish for hours slowly getting burnt on the bottom and cold on the top. It is ironic to have to wait for 45 minutes to be seated (and be $24.95 + tax poorer), considering that I managed to get into The Bank the night before with no wait (and not have to be out of pocket). In any case, the food never fails to disappoint. I once watched a feature on TV (PS: the only thing that I watch is Food Network and Travel... and occassional bit of American Idol) on how they source the ingredients for buffet food. While it was not able to gross me out and put me off buffet forever, it's enough to get me into thinking that the prime rib that they had served in Le Village Buffet is the one that is near or past the expiry date @ Les Artistes. I could not help but be slightly perturbed. ",0,1,0,0,0

 So as usual-photoshoot in the desert and decided to stay in Vegas to have some fun. Went to hotels.com and looked at the cheap hotels-I saw the Riviera on the list and hadn't stayed here before so I thought I'd give it a try. I noticed on the reservation that I could choose the upgrade of ""Encore Room"" so I paid the whopping $8 more and was blown away by the room. the whole price was under $40 for a Sunday and the room was super!! Flatscreen tv, ipod dock radio, granite bathroom with fancy soaps. The bed was to die for. I only wish I had had some company ;0) The bad stuff-it's in a lame part of the strip-oh right-it's on the strip. Parking is abysmal and confusing-no valets and it's hard to load and unload your bags, the front desk people are like drill instructors. But did you see that it was UNDER $40!!! The last room I stayed in that was as nice was the Doubletree in San Jose-and it was $120 a night. Do it... ",0,0,1,0,0

 Service: Good Food: Good Restaurant: Ok Return Visits: Yes Gotta admit, we went over to Hot n Juicy Crawfish first but they were so busy and had an hour wait that we decided to go to Cajun Crawfish as a backup plan because we were really looking forward to havin' some Crawfish and we were HUNGRY so we didn't want to wait for an hour. I used to love Hot n Juicy, we used to go there when it first opened, when we'd be the ONLY patrons in the establishment... But ever since they were on Man vs. Food, we practically have no desire to go there because of the f'n wait!!! But enough about them, this is about Cajun Crawfish, my bad... We were a little hesitant because we had expectations about our Crawfish considering we LOVE seafood... But we kept an open mind, our motto is ""We try it once, if we don't like it, we never come back"". We were greeted right away and the staff was really nice. As we were waiting for our food, I decided to Yelp the place on my phone. Unfortunately the reviews were no bueno but again, we kept an open mind and my husband reminded me of our motto. It's a small restaurant but they have the capability to accommodate large parties. We ordered Crawfish and crab legs. Some of the reviews mentioned that the Crawfish were small, it wasn't the case the night that we came in, there was a mixture of big and medium sized ones. I LOVE garlic, that's why I was always a fan of Hot n Juicy but I always hated how I'd smell like garlic for days, no matter how many times I wash my hands, lemon I use, or how hot the water is when I clean my hands... That wasn't the case here, there was enough garlic flavor but not so much so that I'd smell for days, which was AWESOME because we were meeting up with friends after wards so I didn't wanna smell like I was swimming in garlic! Which, BTW, I didn't! I don't see too many negatives about this place, even though there are a lot of negatives, but we have returned a couple times after our initial visit... Except maybe, they can work on their decor? I kind of feel like I'm at a generic Chuck E. Cheese with that rinky dink mural, no offense CC! Overall, satisfied and have already returned. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My husband and I always stay at Main St when we go on mini vacations for over 10 years and has never had a problem till recently. We had book a Non-Smoking room and I had call before hand speaking to a guy who had confirmed it yet when we check-in we received a smoking room. I wasn't happy at all! The first room smelled horribly like smoke and I immediately start to feel sick. After calling front desk they tell me they are fully book and cannot give us a non-smoking room till the next day. I was boiling! so they sent a bell man to go sniff out other rooms on the same floor to see which is less smokey. So we ended up lugging all or stuff large suit case, large cooler, a couple bags, and my makeup case to another room. While the whole time I was starting to feel very sick and miserable...(I am a diabetic and pregnant.) Second day we called and they said we have to wait till 3PM for a non-smoking room then my husband ended up talking to Vince the Manager and we ended up getting a non-smoking room at 11AM. So here we go again lugging our stuff to another floor. When we spoken to Vince we wanted to be compensated or something since we called and confirmed the day before they said they cannot guarantee a king bed at check in but they can guarantee a smoking or non-smoking room. I'm sorry to say that it was not our fault for you guys to be overbooked and why do the people that chosen what room they want have to suffer? What is the point in giving the option of smoking or non-smoking room because it seems it doesn't matter what we choose and we get shoved to what room is available. Also calling and confirm was pointless the day before too! I have nothing more to say except my husband and I are very disappointed especially when we been coming to you guys only. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I don't really mind dive places because there are times that they have really good food. The place is dated and could use updating. The waitress was good. I think she knew we weren't all that pleased with our food even though we told her it was good. The food....my daughter-in-law had the shrimp scampi. We are pros at making our own at home, but when it was served, I told her that there are variations to it. Her first bite she made a sour face. My son and I then tasted it...understood the face after that. Way too much lemon juice in it, soaked in oil and not quite sure what the seasoning was, but seemed like pesto. The pasta was overcooked and the shrimp just sort of were there. My son and I had the fried seafood platter. Aside from overcooked breading and soaked in grease, the oysters were raw, and the battered fish had no flavor. The breaded shrimp tasted weird too. Needless to say, none of us finished our food. Underneath the food, the plate had a puddle of grease. On the upside, the coleslaw, bread, and crab cake was good. The make and cheese was edible, but seemed to comparable to Stauffer's. This was our first, and more than likely, our last, visit. For a $65 dollar meal, it wasn't worth $10. . ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have 2 words for you, Freaking Fantastic!!! I have stayed in countless hotels across the US and most are boring without any character. This place is quite the contrary. The Graduate has this fun Hipster-College-Americana vibe. I absolutely loved it. I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights, so I got to know the ins and outs of this place. The rooms are extremely clean and comfortable. The staff are very nice and helpful. And their restaurant, The Normal Diner, had great service and really good food. I will be back! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Our meals were OK and service started out well and then went downhill. I should have paid more attention to the reviews of my two friends on Yelp. Live and learn. We were here about 4:15 yesterday afternoon and there were very few people there. We were seated immediately and brought menus and drinks. The chips and salsas were brought and our server explained that the warm salsa was spicy and the cold salsa was not spicy. The chips and spicy salsa were good. The chips are very thin and I found I broke several in half dipping them in the salsa. For our dinners, I ordered the Tacos al Pastor. Here's the description from their menu: Spicy pork with pineapple, pico de gallo and cilantro. My wife ordered the Tampico which is described as: Grilled chicken breast topped with saut \ u00e9ed artichoke hearts, mushrooms, spinach, red bell peppers with sour cream-poblano sauce and monterey jack cheese. My tacos were just OK. The biggest problem with them was there was only one taco. When I get tacos like this at genuine Mexican places, they're always doubled so there's some body to help hold the filling. With my tacos and the single shell, the pico was wet enough that it softened the taco and made it almost impossible to pick up to eat. I did eat the first one that way but I was awash in juice. The pork was OK, but the spice was a heavy coating on the pork. It was spicy but other than that, there wasn't a whole lot to recommend the tacos. I also thought of the al pastors I've gotten from street vendors on East Charleston for a fraction of the cost I paid. Stupid me! With my tacos came rice and black beans. My wife liked her chicken and it was as described. It's the kind of dish you might get at any Tex/Mex kind of restaurant. Dessert was the star of the night. I got the tr \ u00e8s leches cake and she got the Mexican brownie. My cake was excellent. Her brownie came with a bit of table side ta da! The brownie was placed on a very hot cast iron dish safely in a recessed wooden holder. Then the vanilla ice cream was put on top of the brownie. LAst, the sauce was poured over the ice cream and when the sauce hit the hot dish, it bubbled and made a kind of extra buttery syrup that added to the flavor of the brownie and ice cream. Now to service: Up until the time we got our meals, everything was going along fine. Then our server disappeared. She came back once and asked about the food and then was gone again. 10 minutes after we finished our dishes, she was nowhere to be found. The host looked at us several times and it seemed as though he was going to get her at one point but that was not the case. Finally she showed and we asked about a box and asked about dessert. She said she'd get the dessert tray and be back. Again she was just gone. About 5 minutes later, another server stopped and asked if we wanted a box. We told him we'd already asked for one and then he brought his tray down to show us the desserts. We made our choice with him. A few minutes later, our server and this second person arrived with the desserts. She stood by as he did the table ta da for the brownie. Then she left again. About 6 minutes later, she came back with the check and just put it down. When I finished dessert and we had some time to relax and talk, I got my credit card out and put it in the holder and within 10 seconds, she was there to pick it up. Wow, Speedy Gonzales then but not at the needed times. I really like Tivoli Village and there are some other restaurants there that I have yet to try. But, Cantina Laredo won't be one of them. We have so many small places along East Charleston that there's no reason to ever go here again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was seriously disappointed with this show. I suppose I should have read the Yelp reviews before purchasing my ticket, as I expected the show to have 18+ humor but not be tasteless, crass and just plain unfunny. The good -- the acrobatic performances are amazing, as good as anything I've seen in any Cirque Du Soleil show. It's a very intimate theater-in-the-round, so there are no bad seats and the action is right in front of you. The bad -- The show stops and starts abruptly... there's no flow or overarching theme to the show. There's a Green Fairy character who does a few burlesque acts while singing, but you can barely hear her lyrics and the melody just isn't good. The worst are the two hosts, spouting out sex and race jokes like you're at an open mic in the 1980s. It made me very uncomfortable to sit through old, tired cliche jokes about race. I'm not opposed to jokes of this nature -- but at least be clever about it. I was either rolling my eyes at their ""jokes"" or seriously turned off. And for over $100 a ticket?? I expected to see something with a bit of class or creativity at that price. At least the acrobats were impressive, but if that's your thing, save your money for a Cirque show and skip this.

 Was willing to stay in town, because hotels in Montreal on late notice can often be a bit dodgy. This place was located in a decent enough space that I can reach where I was trying to go, which is nice. Chinatown location was cool, too. I'm not as high maintenance as others, so don't really need a lot of frills when I stay at a hotel. The bed was very comfortable and the staff was extremely helpful throughout my stay to boot.

 Reading other reviewer's comments on this place, it seems to have a split personality. Many commented on how the food was good, yet the service poor. My experience was the polar opposite: the food was mediocre-to-poor while the service was decent. I walked in alone on a quiet Wednesday evening. Like other reviewers, I am staying at the Hilton Garden Inn, a few hundred steps from the door of this restaurant. The host seated me quickly in a nice booth and the server came over quickly to take my drink order. She soon brought my wine and some bread, which were both adequate, not outstanding. My onion soup was industrial, but not unpleasant. The Caesar salad was dressed with a tasteless product that probably came from a large plastic bottle from Sysco. At least the anchovies were fresh (for an extra $2). The biggest disappointment was my rib-eye steak. It was perfectly cooked to medium but I have never before had a rib eye which looked and tasted so much like a strip steak. It had almost zero marbling, virtually no flavor (none of the sweetness or tenderness one expects from a reasonable steakhouse) and was grainy as well. I asked the waitress if this was normally such a lean cut and she affirmed that it was. She offered to bring me a different cut of steak, but I concluded if their rib eye was tasteless, the sirloin would be like the sole of a shoe. When I received my check, it was about $45, which is a lot of money for the same or poorer quality food that I could have gotten from a TGIF or Applebees. Overall, I was really disappointed in the quality of the food. Just to add to the reasons to not waste my time at this place again, their martini, whiskey and port list was 2 pages long without a single price listed. No way to tell if the lower-shelf whiskeys would be the same price as an 18 yr old single malt. I find such tactics classless. It places the customer in the position of asking ""how much is the cognac?"" and then repeating, one by one, trying to discern if there is anything of value on the list. Why? This is Middleton WI, not midtown Manhattan, NY!!! ",0,1,0,0,0

We've tried a large sampling of their flatbreads, salads and appies and all were delish. My favorite was the bacon-wrapped dates and the butternut squash soup (I think it was a special). The server recommended a dessert on our first visit, which was exquisite, but I can't remember what it was...I just know we vowed to come back soon, which is always a good feeling when you leave a restaurant.

 A big reason I like Copps is that I like their prolific house brand. Roundy's brand cereal, cookies, detergent, etc. etc. are all good values for my budget. Overall selection is fine -- better than Super Target, Woodmans, Walmart, not as good as a boutique grocery like Whole Food$ or Metcalfe$ The produce department comes through 90% of the time. They failed on fresh basil and the lettuce is cheaper at a couple places I know but pretty much every other produce need is met. They have a lot of brand name seafood but it's from China, so we go to Metcalfes. Wisconsin staples like brats, cheese, beer, and football food are WELL represented. The decor is less theme-park than a new store would be. If you require track lighting and an exposed loft-wall, or a water feature in the tuna aisle, you may have to shop elsewhere. The Park Street Copps is bright, clean, organized, and looks like what I expect a grocery store to look like. The staff esprit de corps is pretty high, maybe because their turnover is low. It's the least busy Copps in the chain but still fully staffed, which means that when you ask for help the clerk will cross the store and show you what you're looking for. You get the red carpet treatment, all just to seek a particular New Glarus beer flavor (they had it) or RIT fabric dye (they didn't have it). ",0,0,0,1,0

 You couldn't pay me to go back to this place. I've eaten at another Lin's location, and it was pretty good. This one, however, was DISGUSTING! The food was terrible...literally nothing the four of us ate was even passable as food, with the exception of the pizza, which my 15 year old said was ""ok"". My kids used the men's bathroom, and they were horrified by the kitchen smoke in there, which was so thick they could barely see...what they could see, however, was gang graffiti all over the walls and foul language on the bathroom stall doors. The tables were dirty, the servers were useless (we ended up just filling our own water glasses repeatedly and removing our own plates from the table). I've been to plenty of buffets around the country, and this was by far the most awful experience my family has had, from the food to the lack of cleanliness to the nonexistent service. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Forget about the high end stores along the Strip. When I want to shop in Vegas, I head to the Las Vegas Premium Outlets. They have a great mix of stores that usually have pretty good deals going, including the biggest Coach factory store that I've seen. They also have a huge food court area, which is nice. Only complaint I have is that it can get really hot during the summer and it sucks walking store to store when it is over 100 degrees outside! Maybe that's their ploy to get to stay inside the stores longer to escape the heat, lol. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This guys are so awesome. We went to 5 other mattress stores and they were, by far, the most amazing. We worked with Bobby - immediately he was NOT a greasy used car salesman. He was wonderful. He really explained the value of each mattress and what makes them wonderful. He worked within our price range and found a solution that worked for us. He was very knowledgable. Bobby also found us a financing plan that worked for us and made it happen very easily. Took us about 20 minutes to buy and get out the door. Not too bad. Beyond that, everyone in the store was very friendly. They were very welcoming. They have a TV and nice chairs and everyone is laughing and being friendly. We couldn't have had a better time. They also sell furniture sets and other things - just ask them. It's a great place. They also have high trad count sheets and protectors... All the good stuff. Go here. You won't be disappointed.

 I really love this place - the decor is fun, and the staff is always super friendly. I laughed when a read a review complaining that the staff doesn't speak English perfectly, I think the reviewer should stick to Applebees :) I love the ceviche, and only once out of many visits have I thought it was a little under-seasoned. Usually it's great! I also like the way the dishes are plated - someone takes time to make each dish attractive. The chips and salsa are my favorite in the area, but I have one warning for this place: a couple of times, my husband and I have had lunch here on a Saturday and found ourselves still munching chips and drinking beer on the patio as dinner time rolls around :) so be careful, this place might be a little too comfortable! This place is definitely worth a try, and it's family owned, which to me is a huge bonus! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I had dinner last month at Joe's in Miami, and dinner at Joe's in Vegas a week ago. Miami Joe's is still very good, but Vegas Joe's is going downhill. Food was dull and uninspired. Plus my dinner companion's seabass entree came out halibut. The waiter did his best to make up for the mix-up, but something like that just shouldn't happen at a restaurant with Joe's history and pedigree. Say it ain't so, Joe. ",0,1,0,0,0

 it was our last day in vegas, and we just weren't feeling any of the buffets. so, we went off the strip right by the 15 freeway and hit up pho so 1. my cousin's girlfriend found it on google and we decided to go there. it was pretty good. i normally don't like pho, but i love bun (vermicelli rice noodles). i got my usual, bbq pork bun that includes some cut-up egg rolls. it was so good. i did have to use the entire bowl of sauce that it came with because it was sort of bland, and not much pork. i normally only use about half of the sauce, but i wasn't trippin'. the prices were good, and the food and service was good also. their iced coffee is very strong. this was my first time trying real vietnamese coffee, so it blew me away. i normally drink weak coffee, but this was quite a jolt. it was a little too sweet, so i had to water it down with some water to my liking. overall, great spot if you're craving some good vietnamese food.

 Arrived tired, tower 2, 10th floor, checked in a breeze, went up, nice room as always with balcony, yes u can open the doors and have a decent view, went down, ate a salmon lemon pizza at Delight (watch out Wolfgang Puck), started gambling BJ (careful Blackjack), won money, went back to room, took bath - and ahhhh, TV in bathroom didnt work (-1 star), got bored, went down again, gambled, won money, etc etc - guess that sums it up.

 A disappointing cacophony of in-your-face flavors. Having tried two of the pastas and the gnocchi, my impression is that these dishes are the food version of jazz improv - discordant and overwhelming. Like the music, I can see how the Pasta Bar dishes may appeal to many, particularly those who favor flavor intensity and/or creativity over all else. For my taste buds, this was overload. Interesting yes, but I can't say I found it good. Here are some details: Pasta and gnocchi - both are quite heavy and substantial. I prefer a more tender pasta and pillow-light gnocchi. Maybe after running a marathon the high-density pasta would hold more appeal. Sauces - Here is the in-your-face part. The gnocchi sauce is spicy, overwhelmingly so for me (although I do freely admit to being a hot chili wimp). Despite my personal intolerance to hot food, a more delicate approach would have been better. The le Sarde sauce sounded interesting, mainly because I love sardines, but my taste buds could not get over the bizarre combination of strong flavors vying for attention. I could not even pick out the taste of the sardines amongst the culinary noise. And what is with the dried hunks of bread? I could not get beyond the oddness of this one. The carbonara was an intense combination of garlic and black pepper flavors, and probably the dish I enjoyed most of the three. Even on this one, the garlic was out of this world in intensity. On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat. The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness. The ingredients all appeared fresh and high quality. And the food is indeed interesting - this is no boring spaghetti/lasagna place. As a matter of taste, I'm going to have to pass on Pasta Bar. For the price, I'll be looking for more of a flavor symphony. If culinary improv and high-density pasta is your thing, check it out. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Been here a couple of times at night with friends, and I have to say there are better places for sushi. The price is decent for an AYCE sushi for $19.99, but the quality of fish is horrible. For people who are into nigiri sushi, this is not the place to be, the fish is cut super thin and accompanied by a lot of rice. The rolls are decent, and the other non-sushi items are pretty good. The one thing that I really didn't like about this place was the service. The servers would get our first order and then once you received your order it was hard to order again. There were times where we order nigiri and we would wait ten minutes, ask about it and then they would finally start making it. If you want a place for cheap AYCE sushi at night this is one place, but I would rather pay a lil bit more for better service and quality. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We went to Distrito for the first time on a Saturday night. Pleasantly surprised by the colorful decor, open doors overlooking an amazing park and the creative menu. We were celebrating a birthday so we went LARGE and ordered just about everything! The blood orange margarita will have you craving more...seriously fantastic! We ordered all the appetizers and LOVED them all! We pretty much all had cravings for tacos so we ordered a couple of the taco bars to share and it was delicious. Some of the best guacamole I've ever had and the chips are homemade and perfect. Our service was superb! Our waitress Hillary saw to each and every detail and was well seasoned on the menu and how things were prepared...we all think that's very important! There was no disappointment with her suggestions. The manager Ben was attentive and came to our table a few times making sure everything was perfect, exactly like a good manager should. We ended our evening with yummy cappuccino and dessert. My only disappointment was no flan...I would highly recommend this gem in the middle of Old town Scottsdale! They even have free valet parking. Jose Garces should be proud of this establishment. ",0,0,0,0,1

 The Skinny: great customer service when booking by phone (5!) but a show that lacks spectacle and story (3). Okay, the travelzoo promotion site was down so I had to call the reservation line to book tickets for La Reve this weekend. Expecting to wait on the line for at least 2-3 minutes, I'd settled down with a cup of tea, a book and comfy slippers. To my surprise, the phone was answered in less than a minute. I'm not even sure I heard the dialtone! The lady on the line was super friendly and took my order for 3 tickets right away. We started chatting about Vegas and I mentioned that I was a local. ""A local? Let me look and see if the locals deal can apply to your tickets for you."" Say what? ""Okay, it looks like the locals deal is better for you. Let me go ahead and apply that discount."" But I looked online and there wasn't a locals deal advertised currently. ""Sometimes we don't advertise about the local deal but the promotion is ongoing."" Sweet! How's that for excellent customer service? That is 5-star service folks! Now on to the actual performance. Le Reve is definitely a dream... like as in the what-the-hell-is-going-on-here kind of nightmare. At its essence, the show lacked that one key thread that holds everything together - a storyline. It starts off with this girl in white with her boyfriend who sits on a park bench which becomes immersed in water. Then the girl is dressed in red. Let the odd dreams sequences with all these bald dudes begin! Really, the best parts of the show were the clowns. They literally stole the show and ought to have a larger role throughout the piece. They seemed to be the only ones during the show that actually were trying to tell the audience something. There is a lot of dancing/synchronized swimming so don't expect many acrobatic feats during this production. Not to mention the majority of the acrobatic feats are aerial in nature. So if you don't like aerialists or dancers, don't go to this show! To be honest with you, I think that the acrobats/dancers must work their patootie off for this production because they definitely perform numerous roles within the show. However it's a major flaw that these obviously talented, versatile people don't get their moment to shine. During the show, there's so many things going on all at once, the actual performance of the individuals gets lost in the frey. It's a too much sensory overload and it shows. Although some of the sequences were quite beautiful, they lack cohesiveness and personality to make this a truly great show. For that, this show gets a 3 starred review. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have been wanting to go here for yearsssssssssss. Typically when a restaurant has that much hype, you would expect to pay a ton of money to eat there, but I knew the pizza here is not crazy expensive, so I have no idea what held me back for so long. So finally, on my b-day weekend, my girlfriend Abby treated me to Pizzeria Bianco, a place she been wanting to try out for a while as well. As I'm sure many of the reviews probably already note, this place is now open for lunch. We went about 1:30 pm on a Friday and were able to grab a seat right away at the bar. The place stayed busy the whole time, even when we left at 3:00 pm, but you wouldn't have to wait more than a couple minutes for a table. I started out with one of their draft beers, not too impressed so I switched to San Tan on the next one. I loved the coziness of the place, and completely understand why there would be such a long wait in the evenings. I had the Wiseguy pizza and Abby had the Sonny Boy. Over all pretty good. I think we were both expecting to have some light shine down on us from heaven and the bartender bust out some harps as we took our first bite. The pizza was good, and in any other place I would be overly impressed but I think the years of hype stole away some of the pizza's thunder. I actually like La Bocca Urban Pizzeria better. Hope that don't break any of your hearts hearing that. Everyone should go at least one time. I wouldn't mind coming back again as well, I wish I could go before Suns games. I could probably add my name to the list before the game and get seated after! Protip: If you just want to try this place out, go for lunch. If you have time (and money) to burn, it would be a fun experience to drink next door for a couple hours, then eat some tasty fresh pizza. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My only complaint for this resort is the smell in the lobby.....don't get me wrong, it's not foul. It doesn't even smell like ""Vegas"". The best I can explain is to say ""hair product meets bathroom spray"". It does not smell like they are covering up smoke, like someone said. I don't know if it's supposed to smell like perfume or what, but it made my allergies unhappy. They have a great water play area for small children, along with a little playground equipment. I saw, but didn't use the pool, the cabanas seem cool, the mini mart was cool, and not horribly expensive. The bed, and even the couch pull out were awesome! We had a one bedroom, which was a good size for our family of 4. If you are travelling with children, or on a budget, the kitchen is full, and Wal-mart is within reach to buy groceries and snacks, etc. This is a life-saver for our family! It's the only way to go!Unfortunately, a maintenance man had left a blade in the bathroom, which my 5 year old carried out to me. Security had to investigate it,, and was very apologetic, and comped us with a gift card to the mini mart. It is not a casino, so I can walk everywhere with my children, and not be reprimanded for stopping! Very nice staff, happy and smiling, very nice people staying there too! This was the first time we stayed on the strip, ever. So nice to walk out to the M&M store, New York,New York, Denny's, Hard Rock, etc. They even allowed us to stay parked there after check out while we had our vows renewed! Great place....just ask to be away from those dumpsters like everyone else complained about! (p.s., if they get rid of that smell in the lobby, it'll definitely be a 5 star resort!) We will definitely stay again! ",0,0,0,1,0

 It's better than the big chain pizza guys but far from New York pizza. I heard a friend rave about it so got it delivered. The pizza was cool enough that the cheese was almost solidified and I live a mile away. The pepperoni they use is a really good brand. The sauce was OK. A little heavy on the spices and too acidic and the crust didn't even taste like it belonged with the pizza, it just didn't bring anything to the party. We also got the artichoke dip which was spot on, served with tasty, toasted Italian bread. The dip was a creamy, cheesy sauce filled with artichoke that was firm and had a lot of flavor. The only real problem I have with it was that the pizza was not cooked on a stone, it was cooked in a convection-conveyor oven. I could tell because of not only the flavor, but when I flipped a piece over, I could see the screen imprinted on it. If you're going to be as bold to have the words ""New York"" in the title of your brand, at least cook pizza in a stone oven to achieve that lovely dark brown char on the bottom that is a staple of New York pizza which not only makes for a better crust, but overall flavor. I'm willing to give it another shot. Next time I'll eat in and try some pasta. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Overall a really nice little place. Great decor, and fresh squeezed OJ. I got a breakfast sandwich with pesto, mushroom and swiss cheese. The only reason it gets 3 stars instead of 4 is the eggs.

 Our hiking group goes to Chinatown for a New Year's lunch each January/February. Today, we went to Bund Shanghai. One of our group had been here and she liked it very much. She arranged the lunch ahead of time. Since she's from Taiwan, there is never a language problem when we're with her in Chinatown. For lunch, the 10 of us shared these Shanghai style dim sum selections: soup dumplings (XLB), crab and pork soup dumplings, pan fried pork buns, beef fried buns, pot stickers, spicy won ton, rice cake stir fry with pork and cabbage, Shanghai fried thin noodles, red bean pan cake, and eight treasure rice pudding. All of us liked the food very much. I found the XLB to be a bit bland. My favorite was the Shanghai fried noodles. I'd go back just for that. Service was excellent. Shirley spoke with the staff for the most part, but the hostess and one of the servers had great English so we'd be OK if we went without Shirley. The restaurant is very nicely appointed. It's not very large but can hold several large parties like ours at their large round tables. The parking lot is very, very small! I have to come back and try this for a regular dinner, not just dim sum, to get a better feel for the dishes. But, this was a very good lunch! Edit: My photos don't do justice to most of the dishes. I was sitting in the wrong section of the circle and those from our group started digging into the dishes before I could get a photo of the entire dish. Plating was very nicely done! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I used this cleaner for about 3 years all was great until. I received my clothes and it looked like they weren't washed, just ironed. the armpits had deep wrinkles and smelled of my deodorant. My wife asked to have it redone and it looked worse than before like they took it out of the bag and hung it back up, except that now there is two stains on the shirt. The cashier said let me give you a refund. $2 bucks for so much trouble, a ruined $75 silk shirt. The ""who cares"" attitude will keep me away forever. It was a good cleaner until the first time I had a problem. Thats when you know if they are a good business or not, and they are definitely not. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This review is for the long-term RV Park at Sam's Town. Laundry/restrooms clean enough and price is right but there was trash in common areas that was never picked up(we were there a month in our motorhome)..entire park really needs a cleanup; security might take care of this as they patrol during the day. Park not secured enough...need gates at entrance...too much theft (our bicycle was stolen)...neighborhood people around park were questionable which was uncomfortable. Windy and dusty; only the roads are paved-all else was dirt/gravel. No check in office at long-term site and no signs posted as to where to go to main office; we were always directing people...this is terrible customer service though staff at main office was nice and helpful.

 I could swear the weights weren't this heavy before...Ok, I haven't been here for a while but I've been a member for years and even though I have only one ""check in"" here, the reason could be for the fact that the last time I was here I was wearing a beeper, but now I'm planing to be more consistent with my exercise routine, I'm hoping my doctors health warning will be stronger than my willpower. I really like this gym, there's ample of safe lighted parking, the facility is always kept clean and the employees are nice and helpful. You can find the newest equipment available, treadmills, weight machines, and free style weights, they also have aerobic, spinning or many other classes, public or private. The facility also counts with clean locker rooms and clean towel service, there is also a snack bar where you can recover from a hard workout with a delicious drink. You can count on Alexis the bar attendant to recommend something good for whatever your needs are, he makes some killer protein shakes! I will be coming back to this location since it has everything I need....... as soon as I get new gym clothes, I wish someone would have told me that my white and red stripe aerobic shorts and headband were out of style before I walked into the gym.

 I came in here because I heard so much about it on Yelp and different local weeklies. I'm glad Yelpers told me that it was in the Spa Salon because I would have never found it. It was evening when I came in so it was rather quiet throughout the place. I like quiet. I walked up to the counter and recognized Jenny. We volunteered for a Yelp event the week before. I tell you she's good at sales and passing out Yelp flyers. Ok, back on track, she explained the menu to me and I ordered the sesame noodles and the combo bao special. As I was waiting, I was served a duck consomme.. how fancy. Did not expect that at all and it was the first time I've had duck consomme. It was surprisingly good especially with the mini diced carrots. Noodles next, I did not think the noodles was going to be such a large portion but I finished it all, really quickly mind you. It was simple and to the point. I know it's not traditional but I would have liked mine to be really spicy. Nothing like spicy noodles to open up your appetite. And next the baos, I had pork belly, duck and vege. Because I'm generally not a bun/white bread eater, I ended up eating the inside and left a lot of bao. Insides of all the baos I had were seasoned perfectly and had great flavor. Of course my favorite one was the pork belly. You can never go wrong with pork belly. Looking forward to my next visit. Hope you are well Jenny and Sheriden. Like I said you have a niche business and thank you for opening and providing us with great baos! ",0,0,0,0,1

Took me about 15 minutes just to get my first drink. Had the food been good, I would've been satisfied that the food would've compensated for the lousy service- it was not.

 I will preface this review by saying I went to Chima for Charlotte Restaurant Week. I would like to give it another try, with the full menu, not during a discounted, busy time. If you love meat (and I do!) Chima is the place to go. Because of restaurant week, we did not get to try everything the restaurant normally serves. I would avoid the seafood and stick to the land meats. Both the swordfish and the salmon were a little dry for my tastes. Chima's specialty, the top sirloin, however, was to die for. We kept asking for that and the flank steak to come back by the table. By far the best meats they served. Both had a full flavor and were very tender and juicy. The chicken was also excellent - fell right apart. Almost like a rotisserie. Filet mignon is usually my favorite cut of beef, but here it was too salty and a little too done. I was somewhat disappointed in the salad bar. There is tremendous selection - fruits, vegetables, seafood salads, rice & beans and soup. But, I was comparing it to other Brazilian steakhouses I've been to, ie. Texas de Brazil. In comparison, there is not as much variety and the quality lacks slightly. In any case, if you're there to really put away some meat, you'll probably want to avoid the salad bar anyway. They give you mashed potatoes and fried bananas on the side. The mashed potatoes were creamy and rich. I loved them. My husband thought they were too runny. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable. But I did feel that service was a little slow. We spent a lot of time waiting for someone to come by with more meat. Again, I think this may have had something to do with Restaurant Week, and I do intend to give Chima another try. ",0,0,1,0,0

 @TheVigAZ Uptown has redeemed themselves. I went last night with a friend, just for cocktails. Sat on the patio. Our server was very attentive, and made us both feel very comfortable. I finally got to try the Oranje Kreamsicle. OH EMM GEE It tastes almost exactly like a 50/50 bar, with vodka. And seriously, that's just awesome! My companion had a couple glasses of cab, and had no complaints. The DJ arrived, and had a pretty decent selection of music. I ordered the double down, and it was really delicious. The baba ganoush was really flavorful. Overall a nice time was had. (Full disclosure; as a result of my previous experience, I was contacted by the owner, who apologized, and sent me a gift card, which I used last night. It did not cover the tab entirely, so I do not feel any bias should be assumed, as there exists none. My review is as honest as it would be if I were paying 100%. That being said, Thank You Mr. Woodbury. I will definitely be returning to The Vig Uptown) I have yet to try the original Vig. I should do that. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Mortadella is a large Italian sausage or cold cut made of finely hashed or ground, heat-cured pork sausage, which incorporates at least 15% small cubes of pork fat (principally the hard fat from the neck of the pig). -- from wikipedia The fried mortadella in the Muffaletta sandwich was my favorite bite. I never had a fried bologna sandwich and the Oscar Meyer version makes my stomach turn. Mortadella is a tastier version of the well-loved cold cut. I really liked it. As for the other po'boys, I thought they were alright. I've been to New Orleans once. There, I ate at a little, well-known place called Drago's. I ordered a oyster po'boy (because someone on Yelp told me to do it) and had an epiphany. I didn't have the same epiphany here. The homemade chips with BBQ seasoning was a nice touch. Their portions are huge but it's reflected in their prices. Dessert was just a-ok. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I'll preface this review by saying that I was there on a Saturday night, and the place was pretty packed and loud. I have no idea what this place is like during the day, but if you're like me and don't enjoy strangers bumping into you every 30 seconds, don't go on a Saturday night. This brings me to the important part of my review, which is how I almost had to throw down with some v-neck clad, Jersey Shore hopeful who felt it necessary to almost knock my girlfriend and I down as he walked past. I guess he didn't like the fact that I pushed back to avoid falling into the table my friends were sitting at, because he got into a staring contest with me, trying to size me up. Personally, I don't care who you are; there is no excuse for acting like that, especially to a lady, and then trying to get in my face about it because I didn't allow you to manhandle me. I told him if he tried that again, we could finish the conversation outside. I guess he knew better than to try anything when security guards are near, because he left. That being said, there's a high risk of these incidents happening in places like these, where there is absolutely no room to walk by, people are drunk and ignorant, and egos are running high. It takes away from an otherwise enjoyable experience. The music was good, the beer was cold, and my friends and I had a great time. However, due to that incident I had, I don't see myself going back. It's a shame because it is otherwise a pretty cool place. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This was my first visit to the M Hotel Spa Casino in Henderson, NV. We had a coupon for $10 off breakfast or lunch. They serve lunch until 5pm. There were 4 of us. We shared 2 entrees which was plenty of food with left overs. The Chicken Pot Pie was huge! It had large slices of carrots, chicken, peas, and broccoli, in a rich creamy gravy with a thick crust on top. It would have been enough for 4 people. The hamburger was 2 patties stuffed with avocado slices, bacon, and cheddar. The fries were crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. The side was extra. A cup of hot water cost $2.95. Service was minimal. We had to ask for a refill of water and To Go boxes. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Late night half off was great! Besides having to wait 20 minutes to get a table, I overall liked my visit. The portions are huge for the value. Would not have gone if it wasn't half off though. I shared the nachos with steak between three other people, and that was really good and cheesy. For myself I got the chicken chimi. The accents of lime (in a friend's enchilada) and the seasoning on the chicken chimi were appreciated. I'll definitely want to come back on another night to try other things on their menu. Also, on a last note, we'd asked the waitress about the portions, and compared to all the other items, the quesadillas were the smallest portions. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Love Aria. Rooms are fantastic. Location is the best and fabulous comp policies. M life is great. Todd English pub ( as you walk out of aria and into Crystals) is fabulous place for quick bite. Staff is great and smoke is very minimal. Used to stay only at Bellagio..like Aria more. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This Starbucks is awesome. No matter what time of the day I come here and regardless of whether I am ordering inside or through the drive-thru they always get me in and out pretty quickly. I have gone to other locations that aren't nearly as busy and I feel like I always wait at least twice as long for my caramel frap. Great afternoon pick me up when the work day seems like it's never going to end. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Prior to coming, a few people told me it was a great place for French/American. I came in with high expectations and left with utter disappointment. The appetizer chicken sausage was extremely bland with the texture of wet powder. The oysters were ok. I asked for the steak frites (cooked medium) and the meat was barely cooked the first time it came out. I sent it back and it came back cooked medium, but the meat was extremely chewy. It was reminiscent of beef taffy. The duck also came out raw. Not sure if it was just a bad night in the kitchen or if it's like this every night, but I'm pretty sure I could have had a better meal at TGIF. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Another place I usually feel gross after leaving. I do really like the garlic Parmesan wings. I also like that you can get a carrot stick boat. What I don't like is how they skimp on their beer pours... Literally 8oz of foam or more sometimes, and they try to justify it with a lame excuse about how their tap works. Not so... 1/2 the beers poured are full or close to full, the other 1/2 are crap foam buckets. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Wow, where do I start....we actually have been eating here a while now- the mister thoroughly enjoys the red beans and rice and I do like their Manhattan clam chowder. I will tell you now that what I am reviewing is going to be on their service. Usually when we eat here, we sit at a table and there is normally no issues. Well, yesterday we went to Sunset Station and it was Christmas Day. As everyone in Vegas knows- the casinos are packed on Xmas day and the restaurants are usually packed. Since this was the first Christmas that my daughter was spending with us, we thought we go out for a nice dinner. We arrived at the Oyster Bar and there was a little line, no problem we think. So we wait in line, there is a party of 5 in front of us and they are waiting for a table since there is not enough room at the bar. They tell us that there is room at the bar since there's only 3 of us. We don't know if we should wait since there is a sign at the entrance that says ""seat yourself""....well we walk around the bar and find 4 seats available, however, the bar area is not cleaned and there are leftover dishes from the last party...so we thought okay, we'll sit down and wait. So we sat and waited- 10 minutes go by, no one comes to clean the bar area even though the entire staff is walking past us...another 10 mins go by- no acknowledgment from anyone behind the bar or waitstaff...the people sitting next to us tell us they are changing shifts...okay that's fine but why would another CUSTOMER have to tell us that??!?? I say it's okay, I know they are busy...so we wait another 10 mins...by now, the kid is really upset and the mister is FUMING... It's not so much that they couldn't get to us, BUT at least ACKNOWLEDGE that we were there...all we needed was a ""we'll be right with you""...my poor daughter was so upset she just wanted to leave...could it be that we were one of the few people in there with a kid? Maybe not...who knows but I have worked in a restaurant before and customers walking out is never a good thing BUT ultimately that's what happened...WE WALKED OUT...not because we didn't get served but we weren't even spoken to by ANYONE behind the bar...too bad cause we did like the food...OH WELL, looks like our money is not welcomed so we will NEVER be back...

 I had great expectations when I came especially when I saw many posters and banners saying that it's one of the ""Best Chinese Restaurant in United States"". Sadly it doesn't seem entirely true at all. The foods were moderate, some were delicious, but too oily. I had a lot of people with me that day and one large plate of food seemed little. I thought I ordered a lot of food but it wasn't enough in the end. Overall I give it a fair rating but would I go there again? Sure- it's affordable and worth the cost as a whole. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Firmly 3.5 stars. I had two services here since they opened about a month ago. I tested the waters first with an eyebrow wax. I was happy for the price. Sanitation was acceptable and my brows looked good. I'm very hard to please and they are just a hair...very very slightly..off center. It's not noticeable to anyone but me. It's not off enough to try and fix and really I may be slightly crazy and they may be evenl..I dunno. Anyways, I was satisfied (for the price). I went back a week later for a pedicure. It was also very good - for any price. I like that this place is new....so the seats are still working well and everything is clean. They also use something kinda unique - plastic liners for the pedicure bowls. How smart is that ? I've found my pedicure place. My only compliant for the pedicure is the color I picked - it's totally on me. I picked what looked like a good purple, but it ended up being quite sheer. Curse you OPI. I should have said something to the tech. She put three coats on (hopefully it doesn't start chipping, but I""m a week in and so far so good) and I still have bald spots. Again, it's the color I picked, but when I saw the first coat was so shear I should have said something. I'll be back for sure. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Very impressed. I've had this company do landscaping work on a few of my rental properties, and I've never been disappointed.

 Just saw this in Vegas this weekend for my mom's 60th birthday. There was a group of 10 of us and we took up half a row! We all met at the REVOLution Bar before the show for drinks. It's a fun bar and you can sit in the letters of revolution. Nice and cute server too and it's pricey, but it's Vegas! For the show we had the perfect seats. We were 6 rows up (above the VIP section) and right in the center. I will say this again- for Cirque Du Soleil, you do not want to be too close. Last time I went to a show and sat VIP I constantly had to move my head back and forth to see what was happening and felt that I missed a lot for lack of peripheral vision. This time this did not happen. We were far enough back that we could see the whole stage and all that was happening. Cirque shows usually have so much going on at the same time, and this show was no exception. I definitely recommend sitting further back to try and catch all that is going on. So the show was awesome. Obviously if you LOVE the Beatles (and who doesn't?) you will enjoy it that much more. The whole show was very artsy and more like a choreographed dance/play than another show I've been to. It was very trippy and every song had it's own different interpretation. It gave you a lot to think about and also had a lot of moments where you say, "" how did they do that??!!"" So although I would have preffered a little more acrobatics and crazy stunts, the show was still very intertaining and pretty incredible. I mean the costumes and creativity were unreal and I really enjoyed the ""mini acts"". It was a great show, very well done, and well worth it if you like Cirque, Beatles, and have extra time in Vegas. I can't wait for my next show! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Its a great big cinema that is well maintained and pretty clean. Seems always packed when I go, which is to be expected. What I really do not like about this place is the service. Almost every time I go and get a simple order of food it gets missed up. I don't enjoy being stuck at the counter and late for the opening of a movie because they are fixing a accidental double charge to my card. Their restrooms could use cleaning. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It's been a while since I was there, but I wasn't on Yelp then so didn't review Vera's initially. I went to Vera's twice. The first time was a positive experience. The consultant was friendly and showed me a few different styles so I could get an idea for what I wanted. The second trip was a completely different story! We changed our wedding to a destination and so I was looking for a different type of dress. When I called to make the second appointment I requested the same consultant and they said that wouldn't be a problem. When we got there, we were waiting and I saw my consultant starting to work with another bride. I asked the woman at the desk if there had been some mistake, as I had requested the same consultant. They said it wouldn't be a problem and switched. Big Mistake! Clearly my consultant had no desire to work with me. I'm not sure if that was because it was my second visit or if it had something to do with changing the type of dress I wanted. But whatever it was, she was very unfriendly this time around. I asked to see dresses by a particular designer and she refused to show me any, saying they weren't good quality. In the end, I left very unhappy and vowed not to purchase a dress from them. I then had my second visit to Brandi's Bridal in New Glarus and purchased my dress there! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I love love love the ambiance of the restaurant. It is fun and funky, great youth for Gilbert! The margaritas are great and you can't really mess up chips and salsa! Having worked in restaurants for 6 years, I have probably sent food back less than 5 times in my life. Joyride would be one of those times. Very bland carne asada. Management was great in offering me something else and giving me coupons for my next visit - I really appreciate the customer service. So basically, I will go back, but I will stick to drinks and apps :) ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is G-H-E-T-T-O. Ug, I hate when my wife needs something late at night and this Fry's is my only resort. Not to speculate, but I once saw a police van confiscating boxes of meat on a Saturday afternoon. Maybe they were having a function, maybe the meat was bad. I am not sure. I do know however, their meat sucks! No butcher here so I am not sure where it's packaged. Also alot of their prepared food looks horrible and terribly un fresh. I have nothing against Fry's but this one needs to shut down and soon. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We went here because my boyfriend thought it was so good and I had to try it. Anytime I go to a new burger joint I always try the burgers exactly as offered in the menu. So I ordered a fatburger with fries. The server asked what kind of cheese I wanted and I said cheddar. When she rang it up my jaw just dropped...$24 for two fast food meals? When we sat down we figured out that cheese was an add on for 99 cents and they upsized the drinks and fries with out asking or even mentioning it. When we got our burger it was dry and over cooked. My boyfriend says they usually aren't like that though. A note to the owner: I understand your employees were trained to do that and they did get an extra few bucks out of me this time but you won't get another dime from me. Over cooked was forgivable but sneaky business practices are not. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This review is for their ""steakhouse "" which is only open on fri and sat , the food was good , but just fancier versions of their regular fare , most items are the same but with a special sauce or different presentation , which that being said is not necessarily a good thing ! Because the price doubles ! The French onion soup is good , but hard to eat in the bowl they serve it in , bread service was a nice touch , when asked about the difference of the prime rib from the ""steakhouse"" to the reg menu , the server said it's a better cut of meat ! , which makes u wonder what is regularly served ? The prime rib was juicy and tender , but really no different than their reg menu , although the veggies were wonderful! a nice mix of asparagus , spinach and zucchini ! The stand out of the meal ! Dessert was a chocolate mousse with fresh berries , served in the same soup bowl ! Lol but none of strawberries were stemmed which kind of defeats the purpose having a fancy presentation , when u have to spit out the stems , Becuz no knife was presented with dessert ! As for service most servers are from the regular restaurant and definetly seem lost in the higher end environment , and most seem clueless about the menu or presentations of the special dishes ! And they do have bussers a who were for the most part vigilant and kept tables clean and water filled , but really clueless on higher end service and when asked a question said server would be here soon ! Maybe give them the job of wiping wine glasses , as my first one had lipstick or a water stain or both ? But it was a nice pour for the price 7$ ? All in all it was a slightly above average experience , but definetly not worth the doubling of price , as the food is prepared in the same kitchen and servers from the regular restaurant walk in/out thru the service doors and as usual most don't look like they like working there ! Maybe in the future when menu Items are a definite departure from their regular fare , and their service is fine tuned , it will be a nice alternative to the hotel ! But as is save your money and have the less fancier versions next store !! ",0,0,1,0,0

 We were hungry.. walking the strip because we were tired of eating at the same old places. We walked over to the Fashion Show and scoped out the restaurants there. We went downstairs toward the thumping loud music coming from the sushi restaurant. At first we were hesitant to eat here, because the music was seriously loud. I mean, club level loud. But we decided to eat here because they had an interesting sounding sushi roll on their menu.. the ""Crazy Monkey"" . We had to have a crazy monkey.. because monkey is just our thing! (no, not monkey meat silly people!) You have to try this roll! It was seriously YUMMY! It was pretty much a philly roll, with avocado on top too. But the unique this was their mango sauce they drizzle on it. It was sooooo goooood! We had already had our fill of drinks for the night, but we also saw someone order a Tsunami Punch... 60 oz of mixture of sake and other hard liquors that I can't remember. The thing was huge! for $10! The table next to us ordered 1 and they had 3 people working on this thing. Next time, I'm going to have one of these! ***** Update Sept 2007**** We went back, and I tried the Tsunami Punch. Sooooo goood! We shared it between 3 people. I'd say its more of a 2 person drink.

 I've been there once. I did happen to go on a night they were offering a 5.99 anything on the menu (ups the value point) special. I took that chance to get both a big chicken and cheese quesadilla and big meaty burrito. Both came with chips. The chips were good but the salsa bar was of the refridgerated variety. While that's obviously good toward keeping things fresh, the problem was everything was so near the freezing point that you couldn't each your chips with salsa. The excellent queso stepped in for a save. The two entrees were bland and the seating area left much to be desired. All in all, it's not bad but not so good as I'd want to return. It's a home grown effort with out the million dollar budget chain restaurants use to get the details right, I know. It's when a small mom and pop's joint still manages to get the details worked out, you have found a winner. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We booked a 1 bedroom suite through Jetsetter, which is actually associated with Luxury Suites International, which owns several floors in the 3 towers of the Signature. Because it is owned separately, you cannot ask the front desk of Signature to do anything for you, like extend your checkout time, request supplies, etc. They'll give you the phone for LSI, which you then have to call during their business hours. Master bathroom: (mentioned first b/c it was the most impressive) The master bathroom was very spacious and well equipped (except no toothbrushes or toothpaste). Plenty of towels, there's like 6 sets of everything! Two sinks in the master bathroom, a glass shower, and a whirlpool tub with jets (watch your step, it's slippery when you get in!). There's a magnified and illuminated makeup mirror as well as a hairdryer. The shampoo, conditioner, gel, lotion, and bar soaps are all mango something or other. There's even a TV in the bathroom. The toilet has a separate door and it always smells a little stuffy in there... Our first night the shower took like 15 minutes to start producing hot water. I was not very happy. =P We didn't have that problem again the other nights. Master bedroom: The master bedroom itself had a queen bed, a large desk with a TV that rises out of it when you turn it on, and 2 closets, one with a safe and ironing board/iron, and the other with just hangers. There's an iPod dock/alarm clock that says it doesn't work with iPhone but it does, albeit low quality sound. Living room: The living room has a sofa bed that folds out into a fully made queen bed. There's extra pillows and blankets in one of the closets to throw on top of the already made bed. There's another TV in the living room, as well as a balcony facing the strip. Windows are metal-plated with a gold color. Second bathroom: Smaller, has the glass shower, full sink and typical amenities expected of a hotel room. Kitchen: Electric glass stovetop Oven Pots/pans/plates/bowls/utensils/cups/wine glasses/pans for baking Coffee maker and coffee/tea Full sink and dishwasher Detergent, sponge, dishwasher detergent Fridge/freezer 2 complimentary bottles of water per day Wifi is spotty depending what floor and tower you're. 3G and cellphone service on AT&T also. Hardly worked at all for us in Tower 1 on the 18th floor. We thought it had to do with the metal coating of the windows, but our friends in Tower 2 on the 25th floor, also on AT&T, had no problems with their cellphone or wifi service. Tower 1 has a business center you can use to check in for your flight and print free boarding passes. One of the gyms is also located here. The pools are at Towers 2 & 3. Starbucks is in the walkway from Tower 1 to the connector to MGM Grand. The walk to MGM is about 5 minutes if you use the people movers (horizontal escalators). Once you actually get to the MGM, you still have to go through the food court/restaurants and casino before you get to the strip. I'd say it was like a 15 minute walk total? It feels like a long time, but hey, you'll need all the exercise you can get after pigging out at all the buffets! ;) I do like that the hallways are very short so even if you're the room at the end of the hallway, it's not that far of a walk. Despite the inconvenience of getting to the Strip, I would stay here again, IF they improve their cellphone reception or at least wifi. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I went here with a large group while out on Fremont street. Based on the previous yelp reviews I tried to steer away from this one but my group really wanted to eat here. The service here was friendly but I think that's where the service ended. The food came out quite slow and my water glass was constantly empty. I think in a bar atmosphere like this it would be appropriate to leave a pitcher of water at the table (if service can't keep up). I ordered the bacon blue burger which was not good at all. Probably one of the worst burgers I've ever had. It was overcooked and burned even though I ordered it medium well. It had white ""sauce"" cheese with bacon in it which was quite disgusting. I ate about half of it and then felt pretty terrible afterward. The only thing saving this place is that the calamari was some of the better I've ever had. That's the only reason why it gets 2 stars instead of 1. Unless you're here just for drinks I would advise to stay away. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm not going to lie: we were here with a large group (19 people) and in a rush to head over to the Marquee (or was it Tao?). Between us all, we probably ordered 4-5 pizzas and I only got to try one: the typical BBQ chicken. Was it good? Yes. Amazing for a Wolfgang Puck restaurant? Maybe, maybe not. It didn't blow me away like I thought it would, but maybe we should have gotten something else. Of course, the ambiance is great in the Venetian. We were sat outside next to the bar and got pretty decent service -- except my friend who sat in a corner behind a pillar got skipped over his water a couple times, but it's forgivable. Moral of the story: don't get a pizza at higher end places. If you like, it seems like they have smaller, quieter seating behind glass doors. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Okay I'll base my review solely on the food. I went here with a friend on a visit to Charlotte thinking it would be a great evening of good food. I was wrong. First off, the appetizers, a promising ricotta stuffed mushroom dish, arrived to our table luke-warm. Really disgusting. Okay I lied, I must mention the service right quick. I don't like so-called fine dining establishments where the servers don't use trays and stack your plates on their arms and carry your plates with their thumbs centimeters from your food. Then the over priced entree came out and let's just say I've had better Italian at Olive Garden. All in all I was more than underwhelmed. Save your money and go to your local OG. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My first (of many) Cirque du Soleil shows. Absolutely jaw dropping! Most of the negative reviews focus on a ""lack of"" or ""confusing"" plot. At the end of the day this show is still ""cirque"" as in ""circus"". Of all the Cirque shows I've seen this one has the most coherent ""plot"", but if you want a proper 3 Act show, go to the movies. These kind of shows are about the feeling evoked and the artistry and spectacle performed. That said, Ka delivers above and beyond. I had frequent instances where I held my breath in excitement and strong dash of fear. The Good: World class acrobatics, stunts, and show moments. The Bad: Its not cheap! That said, I've sat in the upper landing and they're not BAD, seats. That said I would recommend center section, at least 5 rows back if you can.

 I was really looking forward to trying this place after seeing it years ago on Man V Food. I hate to say it but I was disappointed. First off its super crowded every time you go there (been there twice) and they don't take reservations. One good thing is they do have a bloody mary bar so at least you can drink while you wait but being severely hungover and standing around for 15+ minutes is never ideal. The portions here are HUGE so make sure to share with a friend or two, even if you normally eat a lot. Me and two others shared the Man V Food Special Benedict, Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. The presentation while huge was nice (and intimidating) but all in all the flavor just wasn't there. This is definitely a cool place to visit once in your life if just for the gigantic porportions and bloody mary bar but not top on my list taste wise. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The positives- the atmosphere was good and the service was great. My water cup was never empty and I drink a lot of water. Overall, the food was okay but not worth the price and not what I would expect from an establishment with Gordon Ramsay's name. The appetizer sliders were delicious. My entre salad was just lettuce and pears so it was lacking another component- pecans, blue cheese, something! It was disappointing. I would not recommend that item. My husband got the shepherds pie, which again tasted fine just not worth the price and it was smaller than I expected. We shared the toffee dessert which again was good but still average for a dessert. We just didn't think it was worth it. We wouldn't go here again. It wasn't bad, except the salad, but we would rather go somewhere else next time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The venue was a little difficult to locate because the sign is a bit cluttered with their unusually long name. Just look for an Italian flag and bellissimo! You've found it. The inside has a modern interior with a bar at the front by the chefs. I don't recall seeing sushi on the menu, but I feel like it's a nice touch that pays homage to a typical Japanese restaurant. The import beer was nice. I recommend the red rice hitachino. A different take than your average kirin. The bread rolls they give you as wait weren't anything specular but we really enjoyed it, we asked for a second serving ha! I ordered a salmon fettuccine with ikura and it was a pleasant surprise. I never would've guessed that pasta with a Japanese touch would taste so good. The appetizers are good but nothing out of the ordinary. The jidori chicken is similar to a regular karage chicken served with salad. The calamari was decent but the portions are pretty small. Two things I would return for are the beer and pasta. I wish that I ordered two plates of pasta instead of one dish and appetizers. In my opinion, skip the appetizers and head straight for the pasta with a side of beer. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Walking down Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill one day I decided to try Commonplace Coffee. I ordered just a small house coffee, $1.25 for an 8 ounce cup. Not a bad deal for a great tasting cup of coffee I enjoyed while sitting on one of the many benches that line Forbes. While the coffee speaks for itself, there are other things that were negatives for me. I had the same experience as Terry B. with my lid - it was just thrown on the counter as opposed to handed to me or put directly on the cup itself. Also, I was asked if I want cream and when I said yes, I was given a carton that is kept behind the counter. I found it odd that they don't leave a container of creamer out with the sugar like any other coffee shop. The coffee was good and hot, though, which leads to my last criticism - the cup itself. The to-go cup is not very heavy and they did not offer nor did I see a holder to place around the cup. So instead I nearly burnt off my fingerprints while I held the cup. Long story short: good coffee and probably a better experience if you stay there and not get it to go. I'm just undecided as to whether or not I want to find out. ",0,0,1,0,0

Be prepared to be served some very super duper unique lattes by the beautiful gentlemen behind the counter. Unlike the gourmet lattes you find in most coffee shops, the ones here are uniquely Italian style. It's creamy and rich in coffeeness at the same time and in perfect harmony (kinda like Opera singers, yea). The lattes are also super cheap compared to most places ($2 - $3 the last I checked). The decor and staff will in no way hold back any of that Italian pride. The shop is filled with Italian football flags and jerseys, and most of the staff conduct themselves in full Italian hipster style. Hipster? Yes, very much so. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Our second visit was as much fun as the first. They now accept reservations! Return visits are a must to work one's way through the menu. Eat here before the place is overun with winter visitors. ",0,0,0,0,1

 And the award for most uncomfortable chairs goes to... drumroll, please... SHIMMER CABARET! The god awful seats were all I could think about at first. Luckily, I was seeing MO5AIC and once they came on I forgot all about the the feeling of being jabbed in my back because I was on the edge of my chair the entire time! Many of the seats are next to small cocktail tables, which is nice if you're drinking. A couple of the rows are extremely tight but many have very good leg room. It's a small theater, which gives you a pretty good view of the stage from almost anywhere. There's a bar with some premium liquor options and, naturally, overpriced drinks. Definitely not the worst small theater I've ever been to but if the show were not as captivating it would have been a very painful evening. ",0,0,1,0,0

 It is and has been the best gym ever. The staff are courteous and the equipment is up to date. It's worth the money. My kids even like the play area. But you shouldnt sign up cause I want it all to myself ! Overall a good gym. Equipment is good and updated. It gets busy during peak times but thats expected. ",0,0,0,1,0

 As soon as I got off the plane, I was whisked away to Hohokam Park to catch the Giants vs. Cubs game. As a Giants fan, I was a little nervous about going to the other teams park in my orange and black but everyone was nice and just having a good time. We had lawn seats and at $9/each they were such a steal (especially since lawn seats at Scottsdale Stadium were $30/each)! Thankfully it was a gorgeous day in AZ at 85 degrees, so the lawn was the best place to be. I'd definitely get there early though so you can snag a good spot; luckily we found one but we didn't have the best view (there was a huge pole in the way). Bring a blanket to sit on! There were tons of food options and I ended up getting a burger basket at Black Angus for ~$10. All vendors are CASH ONLY and ATMS are provided but with a service fee. Service was fast and surprisingly served with a smile! You'd think they'd all be tired of all the drunk people but everyone who helped us was great. Beers were forever flowing and the lawn is probably the most popular spot to get your drink on. We had a great time and I hope to be back next Spring! The only reason Hohokam Park isn't getting 5 stars is because I'm forever a Giants fan and this is where the Cubs call home ;) ",0,0,0,1,0

 Not a very inviting place as you walk up to the place it looks as if there landscaping just vanished, it looks like an old strip club with a flashy sign, as you walk into the dbl doors there is a sign that says ""if doors locked ring bell for entrance""....Scary like an old speakeasy. The place has a funnysmell kinda like Grandmas House so If you need that feeling then this is your place. The place is very outdated , all of the patrons are locals and the only 2 young kids in there left really fast as they were uncomfortable at the old men gawking at them. I sat at that bar and started to play a few hands of poker and ordered a beer, the bartender brought my beer out a stanard 12 oz. IPA .... looking around I felt unwelcomed, no really even the guy next to me was not a happy person. I played about $40 and I was ready to go I asked what I owed and the bartender says $5, I am like ok and I paid him and tipped out and I thought, wow what an expensive Beer...$45 for a not so good IPA...I do have to say the glass was clean. So if you like Old People and a smelly not very friendly bar then this is where you need to go as for me NEVER again... Sorry to say but I had High hopes for this place. Let's see if this place is still open in 6 months from now. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I am new in town and stopped by for dinner. I should have tried the pizza first but tried the eggplant parm instead to go(carry out). When I got home I was a little confused being from Brooklyn NY. I have never seen eggplant cooked in a deep fryer in my life. I was surprised when I took my first bite because I never had this hero chew crunchy or oil/grease shoot out like a cannon. It seems like it might have been over cooked??? I was starving so I forced myself to try to eat some more of this unfamiliar hero. I couldn't do it anymore so I threw it out. My dog would bite me if I fed this to him. I will go back one more time and try the pizza just because of the reviews but if this goes sour forgetabutit!!!!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 This place is just as good as the one in it's partner hotel, The Venetian... So, if you wanted to eat at this restaurant, you can go to either and have the same great food... My favorite is the Miso Glazed Salmon... Total best... But if you like having more than one item, they have combination dishes... Two of their regular dishes, just a smaller version paired together to be one dish. Service is done with a smile and a friendly attitude... and their desserts if you can get that far are cheesecakes from the infamous Cheesecake Factory... SOOOO YUMMS... So, even if you don't go for dinner, go for the desserts... Enjoy... ",0,0,0,1,0

 They are fabulous when you order the margaritas either full price that is less than $5.00 or happy hour that seems almost free. The food and service varies just like any other Sonoran Mexican place,when we were here this weekend Emanuel gave use truly spectacular service unlike any service we had here before. I always order the Chicken Fajita salad and every time it is slightly different but always decent I had it at least four times.

 Incredible! I'd highly recommended the pulled pork roll so juicy and tender, bbq sauce on the side thankfully. My mates loved their food of chicken burger and fish and chips (batter very crisp & light) went on a Wednesday night with two mates. It was extremely busy so had to que for 10 mins. The staff weren't flustered which I thought was very professional. awesome selection of whisky didn't get a chance to quiz the staff on their knowledge but I'm sure they'd be good. Great selection of cider and beer especially local beers and lagers. outside seating great for a sunny night. Sofas and big screen TV for the footy too. A definite must for locals and visitors to the city for a great night. Xx ",0,0,0,0,1

 We went on a Sunday and they were advertising on a sign out front Happy Hour (Porky Hour) half price appetizers and drink specials. The pricing for specials was confusing to the point where the staff could only charge certain prices depending on where the hostess seated you in the restaurant. That was confusing and pretty stupid. 3 star management, but 4 star service. Our waitress kicked ass. And of course, 4 stars for the delicious food! We had the Redneck Tacos, which were a perfect combo, and a meal for one by themselves. Great big portions! We split a 4 Meat Platter and it comes with 2 sides and their 3 kinds of BBQ sauce. The brisket was perfectly cooked medium rare. The ribs were good but a little overcooked. The chicken breast was good, but on the dry side. Sauce made up for that well enough. Last meat was the pulled pork, same as comes on the Redneck Tacos, which was just perfectly tender and flavorful. At $20 it was a good deal and we had plenty of leftovers for the next day's lunch. Porkopolis lived up to its name with its pork. We'll be returning to this restaurant with the hopes that they work out a few of the start-up kinks.. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I didn't know there was a Nielsen's in the Las Vegas area until I stopped at Nielsen's in St. George, Utah two years ago. They had a sign with the new address for their Henderson store. I bookmarked the place then but never thought to stop. If you're an avid Yelper, you understand that when it comes to bookmarks. Since the burger joint went to doesn't serve dessert, and we had plenty of time before going to the Sin City Opera, we drove to Henderson and onto that piece of Eastern Avenue that can be the most frustrating drive. I had no trouble finding Nielsen's and it was fun introducing my wife to something I enjoyed in Utah. I got a vanilla concrete with cheesecake. Concrete is the thick frozen custard whipped with whatever you choose to have in it. They have three flavors of custard--vanilla, chocolate, and the flavor of the day which was Rocky Road last night. The concrete was very good and exactly like what I had in St. George. My wife enjoyed her raspberry sundae. The shop in Henderson is very small. There is a considerable amount of old time things to give the shop a nostalgic air. Check these out. They are quite interesting. There's also a small patio in the front with some seating there. I'm glad this is on the other side of town from me. If it was closer, I'd probably be stopping more often. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This complaint is specifically for one of your ""dog trainers"" at this location. I don't know if there is more than one trainer there, but he is a Caucasian male with dark hair and HUGE gauges in his ears. I didn't happen to get his name and I REFUSE to go back to that store as long as he continues to work there. First of all, it's bad enough going in there with this annoying, obnoxious guy working. He generally stands there making weird, loud noises or singing... but he crossed a HUGE line the last time we came in. He came up and started talking to the cashier while we were waiting for another employee to grab something for us. He was standing about 8 feet or so from us. He looks over at my dog and rings this loud bell he had in his hand right at him.. My pup backed up behind me with his ears pinned back (I don't blame him). The guy then proceeds to say ""Awww.. you don't like that?"" Comes up to us and rings the bell right in his face, scaring him yet again... You'd think he'd be able to read signs of scared/uneasy dog behavior considering he is supposed to be the store's DOG TRAINER! What kind of piece of filth purposely tries to scare someone else's pet for no reason? Do you not require any sort of training before you hire these people? He is in no way fit to be teaching your customers how to handle their dogs when he goes around your store, representing you, acting in such a repulsive way. He has no business working there and should be fired. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Hotel Ruby Marie was the delightful little hotel we stayed at during an overnight trip to Madison. It's not big enough to be called a hotel, and it's too large to be called a bed and breakfast, so I would classify it as an inn. If you look up the word 'quaint' in the dictionary, I'm pretty sure you'd find a picture of the Hotel Ruby Marie next to the listing. The rooms are charming. We managed to get a corner room which had a fireplace and a separate sitting area. The bed was quite comfortable and the shower and jacuzzi had great water pressure. Those are non-negotiables for me, and Ruby Marie passed with flying colors. The inn also houses a couple bars and restaurants, all of which were casual and laid-back. Continental breakfast on weekdays and full breakfast on the weekends is included in the room price, as are two free drink coupons, and free parking. My only gripe is that their wi-fi was frightfully slow. We had to look up directions to a few places and it took forever for the maps to load. It was only a mild inconvenience since we weren't intending on spending an inordinate amount of time glued to the computer, but if you're one of those people that needs to stay connected 24/7, you may find this annoying. I wouldn't hesitate to go back to the Hotel Ruby Marie. If you prefer old-world charm to a boring, nondescript hotel chain, you should definitely consider staying here. I venture to say it's more reasonably priced too; we spent just $100 for one night's stay. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I'd just like to start by saying that it pains me to give this place 2 stars because I was hoping for so much more! We took a little getaway to Vegas this past weekend. I wanted to eat some place local, not a big chain in a newer casino. I saw awesome reviews for the Barrymore and booked a reservation for Friday night. We were seated in a tiny little room to the side of the bar with a few tables. For some reason I was expecting a much larger dining room from the pictures online but whatever. Our server was excellent, very professional and knew her stuff. After explaining to her that my husband doesn't eat onions and gags at the flavor we opted for the morel risotto with no onions. From the moment the dish hit the table my husband's face fell. We could smell the onions a mile off. The first flavor on the palate once we took a bite was straight onion. I felt so bad for the hubs - he was as excited as I was about this place. We ordered the steak special for 2 (a 30 oz steak with 3 sauces), the creamed corn and lobster and the brussels sprouts with bacon. Steak: Ordered medium rare and it was definitely rare - almost raw. The flavor was good so we ate it as we were starving and didn't feel like waiting for a new one. Creamed corn and lobster: NOPE. Couldn't taste an ounce of seafood in this dish. Brussels sprouts: Way undercooked with no flavor. This dish needed more time and salt. The cocktails were good but this was the most disappointing $200 I've ever had. We had to stop and get a snack later because my husband was so hungry when we left. Such a sad, sad experience - we will never be back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My friend invited me for lunch with friends since I know my New Mexican food and amazingly, I haven't been here yet after a decade in the valley. I judge every New Mexican restaurant by their carne adovada, the signature dish of northern New Mexico besides the green chile cheeseburger and sopapilla. Sitting outsude is a choice to be weighted heavily given the weather. Nice for evenings but not for lunch in the summer unless you're under the misters. You might THINK you'll be OK in the shade... We ate outside on the patio for Sunday lunch. Anyway service was nice but somewhat inefficient. The beertaps were 10 feet away but our server went inside, I guess to add the order as well as have it filled. It took a while to bring back the incorrect beer. Anchor Steam and Lagunitas IPA are the saving graces for beer. Anchor Steam was served at first in a Hoegaarten 330ml glass. This is UNDER 12 ounces for $5.75. UNACCEPTABLE. Don't accept the ""premium beer"" line, get a big boy glass. My next one I asked for a big boy glass. I tried my friend's bloody mary and it tasted totally righteous - this isn't a mellow V-8 tomato soup pillow! Garnishes vary, you might get a mushroom, you might get a celery stick... Our appetizer was served without silverware or napkins. Asked for silverware from manager. My main was carne adovada with eggs. The plate had an excellent eye appeal and was served extremely hot. You'll need to be prepared for this as all hot plates are served ON A HOT METAL PLATE. BEWARE. You're warned by me as well as the server. So how was the carne adovada? Not technically accurate or traditional. The meat was smoked (they have a smoker and a woodpile out back), and this is not usually done in New Mexico - the pork is usually marinated overnight before being slow cooked for several hours and the fat rendered out. Here at Richardson's not all the fat was rendered out and this made for some sort of funk in one bite, and the smoke flavor was to the point of ashtray on another few bites. Mean and in between though was a nice smoky style to the carne adovada but it seemed overpowering. Good CA has a depth of flavor in the red chile sauce with the other ingredients. It also came with beans and the flavor was great and out of the ordinary. The potatoes were plain and so were the scrambled eggs (eggs are made to order, you don't HAVE to get scrambled.) I guess we have to sit inside for decent and accurate service, but I'll give another dish a chance. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Review time, as I've visited this establishment several times now, yet today's experience merits a written commentary. I'll begin by stating that I've never been at all disappointed with the quality of food. Always fresh ingredients and tasty dishes. In fact, I had planned on giving them a 4 star review several times now, but never got around to it. Unfortunately, that extra star fell off today. Our regular lunch party of 4 was in attendance, and we all love Thai food. Each of us ordered something different from the menu, and all 4 meals, although not all lunch specials, were accompanied by a complementary cup of soup. The broth was lukewarm, and the centers of the tofu pieces were still cold. Not very appetizing. The meals came...and I can't understand why in some restaurants the cooks can't plate the meals to be delivered together. 2 of the dishes came out a good 5 minutes before the other 2. Thankfully, we're all casual enough to discard table mannerisms and begin eating before everyone is served. This may have been awkward in a business luncheon or dinner with other acquaintances. The 3 who ordered lunch specials all commented on how the food was fine, but the plates were ice cold, which cooled the dish down significantly before they were 1/2 way through. I ordered larb salad, which was delicious, but the ground meat was also barely warm. As if they cooked it, then used refrigerated sauce. I know it's not supposed to be a hot dish, but the contrast in temperatures between the ground seasoned meat and sauce, vs. the cold crisp lettuce or cabbage, makes the dish so much more enjoyable. Again, tasty, but leaving me someone dissatisfied. Overall, service was as expected, flavors were above average, but little things like timing and temperature deducted from the score. There are at least 3 other Thai restaurants within the mile or 2 radius that get that extra star, and likely our future business. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Tried Los Taquitos today for lunch for the first time based on YELP reviews! Once again - Thanks YELP!! The food was excellent, I had the fish tacos, and my lunch date had the carne asada and lengua tacos - all were excellent. We plan to go back there and experience more of their menu (I'm a sucker for Pozole - looking forward to trying theirs). The restaurant is a bit cramped during the lunch hour with the people in line to order tripping over the people waiting for their orders and all being elbowed by the people trying to either pick up their food when it's ready or fill their drinks (""bit cramped"" was an understatement). Our plan of attack for future visits is to go at an off time, possible for a late lunch, hoping it won't be so packed then. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Came here for brunch on Sunday around noon, the place was pretty packed, even the patio was full. Two of us waited for about 15mins and was seated in a table next to the bar. Decor was pretty nice, kinda mixed in the middle of antique and contemporary ...it's DC ranch, right? Since the place was so busy, I didn't expect the service to be so quick, and I was right, our drinks (coffee and iced tea) didn't come after 15 mins. Our entree orders were Breakfast Steak and eggs and Smoked Salmon hash...both dishes have eggs. After 20 mins of waiting, nothing showed up, and I had to stop our very busy waiter for a refill of iced tea, and another 5 mins later, he showed up saying ""we ran out of eggs and we had to get some more, your food will be here shortly"" Serious?? it's about 1pm, and you already ran out of eggs??..OMG...besides waiting longer, what I can do?? Our food finally arrived after another 15mins, presentations were nice, my friend's steak dish was pretty good, meat was pretty tender..my salmon dish on the other hand was just so so,, the salmon was too salty and the hash were very dry and not so warm.. I guess the dish was just sitting there waiting for the eggs??.. So our overall experience wasn't so good with the egg situation, services wasn't attentive, either..

 I stayed at the Harrah's from November 13th through the 16th. After reading all the Yelp reviews, I was a little skeptical but because I wasn't paying the board for my trip, I had to suck it up. It's one of the older hotels on The Strip and you can definitely tell this by walking down the hallway & paying attention to the carpeting but the lobby is actually in nice shape. It hosts a bunch of your typical souvenir shops but it also has a Starbucks, Massage area and jewelry boutique. They also have the Fulton Street Food Court that sells breakfast items, pastries, comfort food & pizza. I ate pizza once & it was just okay. We upgraded to a one bedroom suite with 2 beds and I have NO complaints on how the room was maintained when we got there or during our stay. We had a great view of the Highroller outside our room and the bathroom was gigantic! Perfect amount of space for 2 women to get ready! The housekeepers were actually very eager to clean our room but since my family members are not early risers, I had to ask her to come back a little later in the day. I have little to no gambling experience but I did manage to win $110 in less than 10 minutes! All in all, my experience was pleasant and even though I probably wouldn't book here on my own tab, I'm definitely coming back to gamble! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I thought the lack of a casino floor was going to bum me out but you know what, it didn't matter; I actually like that the place doesn't smell like cigarette buds. Bellagio is right next door and it's connected via a bridge so you can lose your money that way; I sure did =,( Best part of the spacious room was the kitchenette. Boy did it come in handy. What's better than left over Firefly food after a night of drinking? There were some minor ""flaws,"" I will say. The refrigerator was tiny. It wasn't deep at all so we had to turn our to-go box vertically to be able to close the door shut. The blackout shades don't really live up to it's name. The edges of the shades don't meet the wall so light still creeps through. The two reading lamps that are above the bed, they don't stay in place where you bend them; they always want to droop, loose screws or something? But back to the good yeah? Free WiFi and you actually get cellular data. I don't think I've ever been in a Las Vegas hotel with full bars. SWEET! If you guys want the Vegas treatment but don't mind the further walk or lack of a casino floor beneath your feet, I recommend Vdara. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Went back yet again for another touch up for my ""ombre"" fade from my natural (black) to light brown. This time I was unable to book my appointment with Emily B. so instead she suggested I go with Roxanne. Roxy was amazing! She did a wonderful job weaving the ombre into my hair that had already been treated to daken back to my original color (due to previously having highlights). She gently handled my hair professionally and perfectly. Emily B. was able to complete the look with a face flattering cut (as per usual) and I am extremely appreciative.

 I've bought a lot of appliances from this store and the appliance people are OK. Igor and Ricardo are especially helpful. However the extended warranty people you have to contact in New Mexico when an appliance fails are just awful. First, when you make your purchase your receipt will tell you your extended warranty is automatically registered. Not true! If you call them they probably will have never heard of you. Then you will be shuffled between a number of people until someone seems to have a clue that you need an appliance repair. Then you had better have in your possession the purchase date, invoice number, myLowes card number, appliance serial number, model number, your home phone or cell number, etc. because they probably have never heard of you even though in a few minutes you can find the purchase on the myLowes web site which actually seems to work!! Then in my case I needed a microwave repair under warranty in a rental I own. After the repair the repairman then asked the tenant to pay for the repair which of course was not required. The repairman put the tenant's first name on the bill and my last name! Then after six months of emails and daily phone calls to Albuquerque for a couple of weeks they finally sent a gift card to the tenant to pay him back even though on the phone they promise to return calls from ""the boss"" in 24 hours. The ""Gift Card"" is only redeemable at Lowes for a purchase and you cannot get a cash refund!! Outrageous! Also I recently got an email about another repair on an oven with extended warranty in another of my rentals. After not being able to repair the two year old oven following two attempts, they decided to refund my purchase price with a gift card. Of course they mailed the gift card to the address where the microwave was repaired a year ago which is not where this oven is located and the gift card was mailed to a residence I moved out of two years ago. So I tried calling to correct this using the detailed numbers for the transaction on the email and of course they hadn't a clue as to what was going on and came up with yet another of my properties. They then put me on hold and cut me off. In yet another recent fiasco they installed a dishwasher improperly and the drain hose came lose under the sink and flooded the kitchen. They had used duct tape to fasten the hose instead of the proper connector!! Since the install was done two years previous it of course was not covered under the extended warranty which was still in effect. The so called extended warranty does not cover installation errors beyond one year! Buy your appliances at Home Depot or R.C. Willey. They can't be any worse although I have yet to try them.

 3-1/2 stars! First of all, I didn't realize that Thai Pan was not a sit and order restaurant, so I was surprised when we arrived to find it more like Pei Wei or Paradise Bakery style order at the counter and they give you a number to put on your table. That is not necessarily a bad thing . . . just caught me off guard. The colorful menu has many offerings -- traditional Thai curries, Chinese stir-fry style entrees, Vietnamese Pho dishes and an abundance of noodle options. I had a difficult time making a choice. I ordered the Pad Thai with shrimp and tofu. It was tasty, but for me, a wee bit on the mild side. I probably should have ordered it medium spicy. One friend ordered the Panang Curry. He was disappointed -- it was on the soupy side and the portion, compared to the noodle dishes was much smaller. Our other friend also ordered the Pad Thai, but asked for it to be spicy. A recent fan of the traditional Thai dish, she was overjoyed with the blend of sweet and spicy. My hubby who usually orders the ""dud"" dishes chose the Peanut Noodles with Chicken, and we agreed that his was the best tasting and most flavorful dish of all -- a total home run. Service was very friendly. We were greeted at the door by a young man who explained the menu and how to order. In no time, we all received our entrees. Thai Pan is obviously a local favorite because within minutes of our arrival, the place started to fill up with what appeared to be regulars. I love finding close by mom and pop style restaurants that I can rely on for my Asian fixes, and now that I know I need to bump up the spice, I know we'll be back, at least to order the Peanut Noodles! One other note -- next door to Thai Pan is the most divine gelato shop -- That's Amore (see review) so save room for dessert!!! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Thai Spices is THAI-RIFIC! Yelper Mark R. periodically posts these scrumptious looking photos on Yelp from Thai Spices so I thought I'd have to check this place out when I'm by this area and I'm glad I did as my experience was VERY GOOD! We started with tasty Sweet Potatoes appetizer. They came out very thinly dipped and didn't seem oily at all. The kind of potato they used almost had a sweet chestnut like flavor and was very good. They came with sweet and sour sauce that was OK but a little sweet for my taste. My husband had the Thai Spices Basil with the added option of making it Thai Style with Chopped Ground Chicken and Crispy soft fried egg. The chicken in the dish was moist and flavorful and the fried egg was excellent. It had a thin crisp all around it and a soft center that oozed it's richness into the dish like it should. This was a much better variation of this dish than I had at several other places in the valley. However I did think this dish needed more basil and would ask for extra basil next time we are here. I am a sucker for anything pumpkin in a Thai Restaurant so I had to order the Pumpkin Tofu Curry. This variation did differ from others I've tried but was still very good. This version was vegetarian and made with red curry. It had a silky richness to it from the pumpkin with only just a few tasty pumpkin chunks in it. The vegetables in it were cooked just right and the tofu was nice and helped to lightened this dish. I do note the portion was very small but it was delicious and I had enough anyway. Service was friendly and efficient. A very SOLID 4 stars THAI-RIFIC! Located in Mekong Plaza ",0,0,0,1,0

 Lets first start off with , we eat mexican food 4 times a week , and the name of this place has nothing to do with mexican , should have guessed . This place is cute, severs are good, chips are good, hot sauce is good, but not chucky.. All that said the food looked good delivered , we all bite in and wow,no taste, blaned , , the cheese enchiladas was so bad couldnt eat them , cheese was melted , but the homemade wrappers under coked, black bean tasted like they opened a can of black beans and poured on the plate, not drained, no spicy, my husband refired beans the same way . We all three couldnt eat our meals , such a disappointment . I guess thats why happy Hour is from 11am-7pm My feelings are never go in unless your thirsty , not hungery. . So giving it a 1star is pushing it , and thats chips ",1,0,0,0,0

 A coffee shop so new not only has it not been Yelped, but its not even on the company's website! So I came in today and ordered an iced Matcha green Tea There was no wait, it was almost completely dead despite the many people walking around Westgate. It took a while to get my drink. Normally I drink it like its water. In gulps. This was so bland and watered down, nearly flavorless. Water would have tasted better. I thought that maybe I just ordered the wrong drink, but, drink in hand, I stopped by two more shops on the way out then went and looked at an apartments complex I was considering moving to. I was asked at each place how it was and I responded the same way each time, ""It's barely ok"" I was told at each place that my response seems to be the general consensus. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I am expressing my serious disappointment in this venue!! I want to let anyone out there know that I purchased tickets to Katt Williams at Stand up Live had a great night planned... I love comedy .... was not allowed in! I had a valid legit ticket purchased from Stand Up Live! Shannon with management REFUSED to let us in. We purchased tickets as a group and they printed out seven tickets on one paper!! It was disastrous! We asked them immediately when we got the tickets at their window to separate them if not individual not 7people arriving together exact same time! My boyfriend and I were not permitted in this is the absolute truth this venue Is awful be aware !!!!!! YOUR VALID LEGIT PURCHASE WILL NOT ASSURE you will see the show!

 The best part of eating breakfast here was there was no line at 7:30 AM. It was down hill from there. Coffee was extremely bitter. Omelet was bland and was tasteless. The only thing edible was bagel, doughnuts, and toast. Ok the cereal was individual packing. Getting wervice from the servers were painful. They cannot be blamed. our server was taking care of half the floor. I requested milk from a woman in a suit and was directed to request it from the server. The second time i saw the woman in the suit, i informed her that i have not seen the server and i would like a glass of milk. She then yelled across the floor to our server to get us a glass of milk. Poorly handled and demeaning to the server. I certainly will not come here again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 They can't even get your steak right the way you want it. They screwed up 3 times on my steak left it red red inside and I told them that's it I don't want anything more.

 Don't get the Petite King room. The size of the room is really petite and even more crowded with furniture. Even for 2, we felt really cramped. The shower is not clean, the toilet and shower is separated by a misty glass wall that doesn't completely reach the ceiling (no true privacy and you can see the shadow of the person using the can), the air conditioner is the portable type (how ghetto), and there is no ample space to put your toiletries down next to the sink. It seems like these rooms were designed to cram in as many people per sq feet. For $200/night this room is not recommended. I think a fairer price point is $80/night. But it's Vegas, who am I kidding! I think the room is a 3 star room but due to the price minus 1 star. Tip: Look for deals!!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Started with a hostess that was to busy to give a nice greeting when we walked in because it seemed like she was to busy on her cell phone. Once we were seated the server promptly came over and greeted and asked us of we wanted drinks. We went through the wine menu and ordered a Cab. When she came back which is seemed like twenty minutes because from what she said they had a hard time finding it. At least she was honest. Then it was the wrong year from what was printed on the menu. How does that happen? Then we had some questions about some things on the menu which she answered. We went for the tasting menu. Great value! Fantastic scallops and French onion soup. Really liked the house salads even though I switched the dressing to ranch. We both ordered steaks which where cooked perfect and the sides thy came with it really filled us up. Then for dessert we had them box one to go and shared the chocolate cake. My wife loved the gelato that came with it. Overall really liked the place. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Unfortunately this is the closest subway to my house and it never fails to disappoint. I first ate here about 2 years ago and the experience was terrible. First off they don't honor the daily deal with the 6 inch sub with drink and chips, fine I ordered a footlong Italian BMT which was a struggle since I could barely understand the employee. The lettuce was brown and the bread tasted old. Fast forward two years, as I gave the place a second chance. Still no meal deal even though every other subway has one. This time I ordered a tuna footlong. The guy scraped the last inch of tuna from the bottom of the tray which clearly was left from last night since I got it in the morning to have as my lunch. I asked him if I could get fresh tuna and he refused - seriously. Lettuce once again brown and wilted. Tasted terrible as expected, I'm done going here I would rather drive another 10 mins to eat fresh ",1,0,0,0,0

 This is strictly for how they operate their ""Call Ahead"" seating. Their food is usually impeccable. I will never understand their stupid call ahead, maintain two list, absurd process. I called ahead at 6:50 pm. Was told the wait was 40 min. Great as I would be there in 40 min so I had my name placed on the list. Got there at 7:30 and they couldn't find my name. So they put my name on the ""call ahead"" list and told about 30 min wait while they were on a 1 hour wait at this point (exactly why I called ahead). Talked to the ""manager"" (really just the key server) and she said they did have my name on the ""call ahead"" list and my wait would be about 30 min. That the ""call ahead"" list just shortens your wait to about half the current wait. Really? And just how do they go about calculating this? My wife has worked for Outback for over 6 years and says that system is still as screwed up as when they first introduced it. Here's a novel idea, when someone calls, just put their name on the list! If they're not there when called, skip them, just as if they showed up in person. Really not that hard and you don't have to maintain two separate lists forever trying to explain your logic in doing so to customers. The truth is, Outback really doesn't care about this system. They're always on a wait so no big deal if customers don't like it and go home. It just reduces the wait time. So we left and went across the street to Gordon Biersch. That's another review.

 We had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. The hostess seemed more bothered than anything when we were seated. The waitress was not knowledgeable about the handful of Gluten Free items on the menu. In fact I had to tell her that something was actually GF even though it was marked on the menu. I ordered the GF chicken tenders which were slightly warm. The water had a funny taste to it so I ordered a coffee with cream and sugar. She brought cream and equal and no spoon to stir my coffee. I ended up asking the bartender for sugar which they had to go find because there was none behind the bar. Very disappointed with the food and service. ",1,0,0,0,0

 If there is anything certain about Las Vegas, it's that everything should be done in excess. And food is right at the top of that list of excessive activities. I usually hit up the Bellagio, but yearning something new, the gals and I tried the Wynn's house of gluttony. I was not disappointed. Before I get to the food, let me just get a little Victoria Beckham in this review and say that the decor in this joint was just god-awful. I don't know who the interior decorator was, but the place looks like all 4 of the Golden Girls vomited (Betty White on SNL!!!) and that crusted vomit was used for decor while poor women dressed in hot pink skirt suits walked around wondering why it is that the otherwise classy Wynn Casino would subject them to the horror of wearing hot pink. As for the food, it's a buffet. So the sure thing is that there is going to be a lot of food. But it's not a sure thing to get good food. To maximize the returns on my investment ($31.99 + tax on weekends), I headed straight to the expensive stuff--shrimp, prime rib etc. The food was great. Prime rib was juicy to the point that it effectively bled all over my plate. Other items were also flavorful. After the savory portion of my meal, I headed over to the dessert spread. I took one look, and I swear I became instantaneously diabetic. I had some fresh ice cream, profiteroles, and cookies. In other words, I was a fat ass, and I was happy. Screw the Bellagio. I'm heading to the Wynn next time. Shorter line, and some damn good heart-attack inducing grub. Perfect cure for a weekend of excess! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ok. My boyfriend has been trying to get me to come here for months. However, I am not a sandwich lover, so I've always refused to come with him for lunch. Once we actually pulled up here (I didn't know that this was where we were going) and parked and I made him leave. I'm usually not this difficult about food, but I like hot food and always think of sandwiches as cold. We went to Samurai Sam's instead that day and now I know what a huge mistake I made. I tried Dilly's Deli for the first time yesterday and I loved it! I got half a Yahoo sandwich (roast beef, melted Swiss, mushrooms, and onions) and a creamy chicken noodle soup which comes with a bread bowl. Both were delish and cost only $6.29. I'm craving both again as I write this. I will have to try another one of their soups when I come back. This location does get pretty busy. We stopped by for a late lunch and just beat the crowds that came in about 5 minutes after us. ",0,0,0,1,0

 On Saturday, Feb. 20, Changing Hands hosted what they probably thought would be a manageable little Ozzy Osbourne book signing. Fat chance! What were they thinking? On the phone early that afternoon I was told only, ""Hurry up and reserve a copy, they're going fast"". Was I told there would be thousands of people there, and that they'd already sold 2,000 books by 9 A.M., and that they were having supply problems? Was I told the line would be THREE HOURS LONG in cold, rainy weather, and they, most likely, were going to run out of books, even for those who bought a ticket/book? No, every indication they gave, all the way down the queue, mind you, was that there are plenty of books, you'll get one. Ha! What a lie! Changing Hands bit off WAY MORE than it could chew having Ozzy book sign at their store. In short, their staff was a rude bunch of liars, and the way we poor Ozzy disciples were treated was beyond deplorable. It was simply uncalled for treating us like misbehaving schoolchildren, and I hope everyone else who was there and froze their asses off in the rain only to get treated like shit and get a post card for Ozzy to scribble on (Ozzy is great btw, he'll be here long after Changing hands) Yelp their minds here too, and show how Changing Hands' staff gets when the heat gets turned up. For seven years now, I've gone out of my way to patronize them, over the big chain stores, but...why should I? I hope they go under, the jerks. See you at Bookman's. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Finger lickin' chicken chicken - what combo you be pickin'?! Not Canes! Best "" strip club"" around! Premium, juicy breast to give Spearmint Rhino some envy. Something wrong with you if you don't check out those breasts and not lick yo lips. I've been back with the BF for some BFG love and back with my Yelperazzi family. Something simple sometimes is the best food. Goooooo Tin! Please keep feeding us nomlicious strips (Gotta slap some Yelpers for not giving enough love to the guy in the kitchen). I tried something different with the Yelpizzles and got the bibimbap special ($5.25). It was pretty solid with a variety of fresh and crisp veggies and nicely marinated chicken with a perfectly fried egg. Apparently there are four weekly specials on rotation: bibimbap, teriyaki bowl, hot chick sandwich, and chicken nachos. I will update as I try the other 3 specials, salad, and baked chicken. I already have a favorite down though- crispy strips, grilled veggies and wasabi cream and sweet chili. Thanks- Jin, Tin, Jin's sister (we didnt get your name) and the ladies cutting up the chicken in the back for your work and hospitality. We're hooked! ",0,0,0,0,1

 *FIRST TIME REVIEW FOR VDARA* i arrived here for my stay at Vdara for the 8/8/12-8/10/12..i sure wouldve stayed an extra day if it didnt cost me a whole body or two to stay here! my bf and i drove to vegas and when we first got here, we were a bit confused at their valet system because the roads were a lil weird since they share it with Aria. but we got the hang out of it, right when we got our of car..we were imediately greeted and offered for bell hop service. we politely declined and moved onto the lobby. front desk- i got here around 2pm (since that is the check in time for several hotels) so i guess that would be a reason why the line was going really slow to check in. but NO, it was because they only had TWO employees/ladies working the frront desk and had two needy ass couples they had to dealt with. so the line i was in which did have 3 people waiting to check in (including myself) turned into 12 people in line! you would think they would call for back up or something. no they didnt..they did have a random guy in the front desk area who had glasses on with a caramel complexion just walking back and front and doing nothing. i didnt get it. front desk was a breeze after 25 mins waiting in line. i had to ask for my complimentary buffet tickets (which i wish i didnt have to because it should be a given) and the weird thing was usually every hotel ive been at usually asks if i would like to upgrade my room..they didnt, but if they did i think i wouldve. $$ lost for them and btw $25 for resort fees each night PLUS an extra $3 resort tax to it each day as well. total $56 bucks! yes, its ridiculous! the room- we got the standard deluxe suite and the room was amazingly clean. i loved the dark wood decor and modern feel to it. i was a little bit dissapointed in the size of the room. i mean, i knew it was their standard room but i wouldve just called it a deluxe room instead of a suite...prb because it had a mini kitchen thats why they had to call it a suite? LOL. we did use their kitchen to save money on us buying food out on the strip, their fridge SUCKS in size/space!!! i mean cmon why give us a kitchen if we cant store the food we bring in it. it was like the depth of a boot size shoe box. i had to sit on the floor and reconfigure every container of meat i brought so the door can close! their electric stove IS amazing though...i dont why there wasnt any dish soap or even a place to hang your dry dishes after you washed them..so i had to improvise by using their bathsoap to wash. the bathroom was on the small size in my opinion but every amenity in there was a great. we used the bathtub - which was a decent size and the shower can fit two people but it was smaller than what i was used to. the countertop/sink area was on the small size for me as well..i had to move their vdara products and bath dishes to my bf's side because it was so small for me to put all of my bath necessities there. the view was great and the bed was probably THE MOST AMAZING BED i ever slept on. my bf and i would be so damn tired from the day/night's events and when we woke up the next day -we were def refreshed and none of our muscles ached! the hotel itself- vdara doesnt tolerate any smoking nor does it have a casino. at first i thought it wouldnt be a problem but since my bf and i do like to gamble here and there..it wouldve been nice to gamble inside of our own hotel. although it was a nice change and i could see vdaras view on why they did so. we didnt mind walking to aria or bellagio to gamble and eat anyways. i didnt see why people were complaining about the walk from vdara to the strip...youre gonna walk everywhere and for a good amount of distrance anyways! vdara didnt have a great selection or should i say nearly any resturant/food options..they had a lil market area but that place was so overpriced than usual vegas prices...because it was organic and all the natural fancy nancy foods haha. so my bf and i just ate at aria or any other close by estashblishments. would i stay here again or not? - most likely not, although i did enjoy the convience of the location and modern amaneties..it didnt live up to some of the cons i had for this hotel. i think im more drawn and spoiled from my last stay at cosmopolitan. i would probably stay next door to Aria since it did have the ameneties i was looking for and etc;or back to cosmo.

 I'm liking the breakfast bowls - you get a couple of eggs scrambled with your choice of up to six toppings - served over potatoes. I've gone the breakfast burrito route but I prefer the bowl. My potatoes were pretty greasy on my first visit, which was apparently their first day of business, but things have improved. BTW, you get your breakfast bowl with potatoes and Texas toast for only $6. No doubt a big part of the appeal is the staff. The atmosphere is mas-o-menos and it's crowded with tables and junk, but the people who work there are great. Very fun, and they toss trivia questions out to patrons all morning on Saturdays. Um, the bread pudding if AMAZING... I'm excited to try their corn dog on a stick - without having to hang around a bunch of toothless county fair carnies to get it. Doh!

 Yes it's fast food, but that doesn't mean you won't be able to taste something exquisite. For a dollar, you get two tacos that are like nothing else you will find (now I see what all the fuss is about). But if you really want to try something that you weren't expecting to be unbelievable, you'll want to try their Spring Rolls. I recommend getting the three pack because these are the best spring rolls money can buy. They're perfectly crunchy on the outside, and the most moist feeling I've ever had in a spring roll.

 I had never thought it possible. An actual Dim Sum place that conjures up memories of Chinatown SF? No. I must be dreaming. There's no way that I can get succulent Shumai, Steamed BBQ pork buns, Lotus wrapped rice, and fried Sesame Bean Curd balls in Phoenix, Arizona. Looking back, it did feel like a dream. Everything was right, even the dumpy decor, and (ironically enough), a tv playing the P90X infomercial in the background. English was poorly spoken, as it should be, and the items are easily identified by pictures on the menu. Some oddities stood out, such as tripe, chicken feet, and shark fin, but I will save those for next time. We got the typical items, including Chinese sausage buns, egg custard, and cilantro-wrapped noodles, and it was all tasty. While not the best I've ever had, it was still delicious. Cheap too! Be adventurous, and go here. I fear that without support, this restaurant will fail due to it's absolutely terrible location. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Crusing around looking for a bathroom and something to eat... (cause and effect at it's worst) my mom didn't want to wait around for Original Hamburger Works to open, which sucks for me cuz I could just TASTE that burger!! :( oh well... we wound up going to First Watch... At first I was disappointed and then I was worried becuase that lil parking lot was FULL on a saturday late morning! We came into their very busy foyer and got seated very quickly... which surprised me becuase I was like.... ""ummm what about the other 20 people waiting for a table?"" But whatev' all's fair love and good tables at resturants. It took a LOOONG time for someone to even come up to us and ask for our drink order, but when we did - our waitress Sissy said she was brand spakin' new and was getting used to the ropes. I gotta admit, she was cool... she was patient and was willing to go ask the kitchen if the chicken salad had any onions in it... and it didn't btw - (yay!). So props for her on that. She even kept my mom's chickery spiced coffee aflowing and even got us some splenda for our drinks. I also have to mention that nothing on that menu is over $10! Score! Our food came and we were starved! I tore into my chicken salad and it was goooood... creamy, slightly sweet, nutty and chicken-y. I was in love. I wish it came with two pieces of toast instead of one, but I guess it's okay. The fruit salad was good, but I wish it were more seasonal... the maranated salad was okay too... a little too sweet for my taste. The potatos I had screamed onion powder! I tried to power through it but the taste was too strong. I couldn't finish it. My mom loved her spinach and tomato omlette and can't wait to try it again. Over all, we had a good time in the multi colored dining room in the middle of downtown... I left happy and not bogged down by a huge meal, which was nice. *sigh* brunch... it's what's missing from my day. To my yelpers: I say go. Atleast once. Go when you want what I call clean food... something nice that will sit well in your stomach and is a nice polite way to start the day... sooo not a good spot to nurse your hangover! lol! and don't worry about the loaded parking lot, just try it anyway and see what happens. you never know, you just might get seated right away like we were! :) ",0,0,1,0,0

 Nice little find. This was my first visit to Christina's. I have spent some time in central America and each country his it's own unique food styles and flavors. Christina's is of Salvadorian origin, and they serve Pupusa (corn tortillas filled with either cheese, beans, chicharon, loroco or mixed) and the pupusa at Christina's are delicious and at a mere $2 each, it doesn't get much better. You have to top your pupusa with repollo (cabbage salad) and tomota sauce; its a meal in themselves. My lunch companion had the beef flatas, Rice, and beans. The flatas were good but the rice and beans were somewhat bland. However, in all fairness rice and beans are not one of my favorites choices. The atmosphere at Christina's is realxing, the waitstaff is very friendly and acomdating, and the food was good. Christina's is a definite must if you appreciate good Latin food for a reasonable price. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was originally walking to Queen's Pizzeria on Main Street to order a vegan pizza, but after passing by this restaurant Thai food was calling to me! I came in here only expecting to glance over the menu and ended up dining in. This is the first time I have ever eaten Thai food and it was a fantastic experience. As a vegan, it can be difficult to find restaurants with a lot of vegan options. But this restaurant has numerous vegan options and I found them to be very accommodating to my lifestyle. They answered any questions I had about what was in the food. I ordered the spring roll appetizer and the Pad Lard Na with tofu. With every order, they give you a complimentary cup of soup and an egg roll/spring roll. The soup was steaming hot and tasty and the spring roll was also good. They also provide sweet chili sauce to dip the spring roll in. I actually preferred the complimentary spring roll to my spring roll appetizer. If I had known you got a spring roll for free, I probably wouldn't have ordered the appetizer. The presentation of the spring rolls was beautiful and the sauce they came with was great. The spring rolls taste a lot better dipped in the sauce, so don't forgo it if you get them! The Pad Lard Na comes with sauteed flat rice noodles with sweet soy sauce, broccoli, Chinese broccoli, baby corn, and mushroom soy bean sauce. My only two complaints about the dish are that I was expecting it to be firm tofu instead of soft tofu, and that there was a bit too much sauce. Other than that it was everything I had hoped for! The vegetables were cooked perfectly, the sauce was sweet like I expected, and it was a very large portion! Definitely worth $10. The only mistake the server made was giving me a diet coke instead of a sprite but quickly remedied it by giving me what I had ordered. I found the service to be excellent and gave them a tip over 25% If you're ever in the mood for Thai food, try this place out! I know I will be returning. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've lived in the area 3 years and had never heard of it! But I'm glad my friend took me here, what a great night! The atmosphere was perfect. Super cozy feeling outside. Felt upscale without being snobbish at all. Great wine list. Definitely manageable without being over the top. We went with the intention to eat real food but our server talked us into sharing some small plates. We tried all four of their dips with pita (not nearly enough pita, but out server offered more before we had to ask), the pork belly tacos, and the zucchini chips. I didn't care for the zucchini chips. But that's really the only issue. That, and the pita. But again, good service cancels that one out. Pork belly tacos are kind of overdone and trendy right now, but these one we're really excellent. I can't wait to go back ",0,0,0,1,0

 Let me first mention, I do not have a problem with the organization Petco. I have been to several of the other Petco stores located in the Phoenix Area and they have been just fine. However Laveen Store is another story... Here is my experience: I placed a phone call to Petco to get my dog groomed. I was told there was availability today (Sunday). As the employee continued to ask me questions and I was placed on hold several times (several minutes each). Once I answered the last question the employee then states that he can fit me in on Wednesday. Of course this comes as a surprise since I asked if there was availability today and he had said yes. Therefore why would I wait until Wednesday? So the next thing out of my mouth is I really like to get him in today and you said you had availability. He asks me to hold on again and comes back with no explanation. I said this is ridiculous you either have availability or you don't. I call back and speak to the customer service person. I tell her the She offers to get my puppy in today and I said no I don't think so not after the scenario that took place. I don't trust them with my puppy. She says, (and let me quote this) ""They are professional"" HA!!!!!! Well I guess I am an idiot since the way I was treated was rude and I won't take a chance with my puppy. Here is my favorite line from the customer service person...then why are you calling? story and tell her why they lost my business. I explain she needs to know about how her employees are acting and maybe can do something about the situation. She states well he is new. I said.....OK but that doesn't explain why they did that. Well let's see, It is probably a good idea that you know what is going on in your store and get it fixed otherwise you will continue to lose good customers like myself. She said well you said I can't do anything for you. I said that's probably why you will be out of business and out of a job. There is only one pet store in Laveen and I prefer to drive up to Dysart or 75th Ave versus going back to your store. Don't you think you need to tell the District Manager or Store Manager so you can get it fixed. If you don't know about how your customers are being treated you can't fix it. Obviously this customer service person needs to go through training too. She must be new. LOL :) ",1,0,0,0,0

 Similar to Chipotle, you have a whole assembly line of workers preparing your meal. I heard this place is always crowded, always a line. They have daily specials and when I went on a Thursday, tamales were their special of the day. It comes with rice and beans along with 2 pork tamales. You can customize anything to your own personal liking. The tamales were just good. It was enough to get me full. Nothing outstanding. The daily specials come with a drink as well. Did I like it? Yeah. Solid 4 stars for me. There's three kinds of salsa. The medium have a sweet, tangy taste to it. So I opted for the mild. The flavoring was bland. Next time...I'll definitely try the hot. Maybe this is a Vegas thing. But personally, I would clump this together with Baja Fresh type-a food. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I'm not a camper. So when I was invited to go on a 4 day camping trip, I stopped by REI to help me out. The sales staff here we extremely helpful. Since I never camp, they suggested that I rent the equipment. They set me up with a tent, sleeping bag, and pad. It was perfect. I paid for my equipment 2 months ahead of time, then picked it up the day before we left on our trip and returned it the day after I returned. When you rent equipment, you only pay for the days of your trip, not for the pickup/return days. By renting instead of buying, I was able to save hundreds of dollars. Thanks REI!

 This is our go to place for Chinese food everytime we go to the airport. The first time we went the service was terrible, but the great food brought us back. We visited the Palace again last night and it was 100% better. We had a gentlemen as our server and he was humorous and very tentative to our party's needs. We ordered our food and 5 minutes later we had all four dishes in front of us (fresh and not pre-made). My personal favorite is Szechwan chicken. However, everything we had was great. The food is very good quality Chinese food and it isn't overly greasy. I love Chinese food, but it doesn't always love me back (if you know what i mean)!

 I just don't get it. This is your classic Brazilian steakhouse type joint. I think they are all kind of the same. I will say the service staff and salad bar at this location are top notch. The salad bar has several options and does not have any of the mess associated with your usual salad bar at restaurants. Reservations for dinner are pretty much a must but while we were there I saw a little of everything in terms of dress. Don't feel like you have to get dressed to the 9's at this place if you are not up for it. The meat is good but after a while it all sounds and starts to taste the same to me. At a little over $50 bucs per head it can get expensive quick. I have no issue paying over a hundred dollars for my wife and I to eat out but for a buffet. Not for this guy. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Direkt am Las Vegas Boulevard (Strip) gelegen, geh \ u00f6rt dieses Restaurant zum Caesars Palace (http://www.qype.com/place/155631-Caesars-Palace-Las-Vegas) Hotel. Zwischen dem Hotel und dem Serendipity die Wasserspiele und Springbrunnen, die von der Au \ u00dfenterrasse wunderbar zu beobachten (und fotografieren) sind. Und zur anderen Seite das pulsierende Leben des Strip. (Siehe Foto unten) Gehobenes Burger Restaurant so kann man das Serendipity am besten beschreiben. Obwohl es gibt nicht nur Burger, die gro \ u00dfe Menukarte ist umfangreich und bietet auch jede Menge Pizzen, Omelets und andere Eiergerichte, dazu verf \ u00fchrerische, gro \ u00dfe Desserts Eis, Cremes und sonstige Naschereien. Im Innenraum sind die Tische sehr eng gestellt, zu Essenszeiten ist es meist gerammelt voll und Gespr \ u00e4chsf \ u00fchrung kaum noch m \ u00f6glich.

 Growing up in the greater Cincinnati area, everyone has there favorite chili parlour. Mine is Dixie Chili on Monmouth in Newport, KY. After moving away to St Louis in 2006 and Tuscaloosa, AL in 2007 I looked for the dish but none had any equivalent to the Cincinnati style chili. When I moved to Tempe for graduate school, I thought that I was doomed to a life without the delicious chili. But then I got curious and googled ""cincinnati chili phoenix"" and Hail Mary's was the first thing to show up. I had never heard of the place but it is right here in Tempe on Priest and 14th. The atmosphere is awful as it is an Ohio State bar... shudder... but I will brave anything for good chili. So I decided to check it out this afternoon. I ordered up my favorite chili dish, a 4 Way with heavy onion. It came out quick, and was served in a circular soup bowl style dish with a knife. If you have ever been to a Cincy Chili Parlour then you know it is served on oval dishes and a knife is not part of the equation. You cut that stuff with a fork, no noodle twisting... However, I didn't let that get me down, the cheese is definitely not the same, but it did the trick. The onions were cut a little too big, but the taste was there. Now on to the chili, I will say, it is all there, I was not disappointed. It could have been a little less meaty, but it was all there. One grippe, Tabasco is not a thick enough hot sauce to serve with the chili, they need to get Frank's Red Hot or the Kroger brand hot sauce. The off track betting was a little annoying but if you are into that kind of stuff then check it out... It isn't Skyline, Gold Star, PRC, or Dixie, but in the Valley of the Sun where nobody is a native, it will do... ",0,0,1,0,0

 Quick summary: - smoke everywhere - ""Hotel"" aspect is mediocre. - fountains, shows, pastry shops are nice. - would not return for the price, better options elsewhere. Details: - A non smoking room means 'maybe non smoking' because people disregard the smoking rules all the time. - Even a non smoking room gets you covered with smoke every time you leave or enter your room, because you have to walk through the casino. Book the Spa tower to avoid. - The restaurants, though 'no smoking', will have cigarette smoke if it's near the casino. Yellowtail for sure has cigarette smoke everywhere, Le Cirque can also have cigarette smoke (depending on if they close the door). Sensi is far from the smoke, but we saw somebody smoking in the restaurant with no enforcement of the law. Michael Mina's is pretty smoke-free. - Overall, smoke is better than Harrah's and Caesar's, but worse than the Venetian. - cleaning staff is top notch, our room was sparkling clean every day. - Concierge staff is not as top notch - we asked for a lingerie store. There's like 4 in the area, but they had to think hard to come up with one. Other similar examples. - Pool closed early (4P?) all the time. They don't want you at the pool, they want you gambling. - asked for tailor service, they didn't have it. Not a big deal, but it's not the Mandarin Oriental or anything. - Workout room is $25 a day - No wireless but they do have wired for $15 a day. But they charge $15 if you need an ethernet cable. Bring your own. - if you touch the snacks, you get charged because they are set to charge on weight change. Seriously. - JP Maury Pastry shop is one of the best (if not the best) in Vegas. - Fountains are the best free show on the strip. - ",0,1,0,0,0

 I haven't been inside a portrait studio since I was changing my sisters diapers... she's 17 now. I went into this Picture People location to get a free/promotional 8x10 for a modeling gig I'm trying out for. Well, they were super quick with the shots and I had a great gal taking the pictures. It took 5 minutes after the shoot for her to pull up the best shots and have me look through my favorites to pick out the 8x10. I only came in to get the free 8x10, but I liked another photo so much I decided to buy a sheet which was reasonably priced. The quality was so clear and the positions and the angle was perfect. The photographer really knew her business and didn't pressure me to buy anything! I think we can all agree that we hate being pressured to purchase and there was none of that with The Picture People!

 Pretty damned good. The old saying is that the best food comes from a ""hole in the wall"" which fits this place perfectly. The dining area(s) are small, but from what I could tell, most people were carrying their food to go anyway. Oh, and don't expect to find it on the strip... do some exploring and you'll find this place a little out-of-the-way. For a barbecue place, Rollin Smoke has a decent sized menu w/ some more odd options like the baked potato, or giant burgers not usually associated. Their sauce is really good with a nice kick, and spice that adds flavor to anything from ribs to their awesome fries. Try the sides. I love how they add spice by-way-of jalapenos to macaroni, and beans. Is it the best I've had? No, but its close. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Went here the other night and when I walked in with my family there were only two people there.. Didn't think much of it, the service (at the beginning) seemed on top of it but once she placed our food down we never saw her again! Everyones drink was empty and I had to call a different waitress to get us the bill.. Let's talk about the food. I had pull pork sandwich with sweet potato fries I can say it was good (8.99). My husband had brisket and it was horrible! It tasted like lunch meat and was just smothered in this sour BBQ sauce... (recommendation- smoke your brisket) it was 12.99 and the portion was so small. (not worth it) My daughter had two beef ribs that didn't even have enough meat on it AND was too spicy for a 6 yr old to eat! I tasted it and couldn't eat it. Why would they put that on the kids menu and not specify that their BBQ sauce is spicy?! We obviously couldn't tell our concern to our waitress because we never saw her again! This place is ridiculous and I wouldn't recommend it at all!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Three hours flew by last night at Eddy's. Don't believe time is relative? Compare three hours here to almost anywhere else. The Good: Crab Cake appetizer (wow), the wine list, haddock entree, stuffed shrimp, Godiva dessert, and the blueberry cobbler. All simply perfect. The Bad: We were there for three hours and it felt like 45 minutes. So, clearly time speeds up in some sort of cosmic time-space twist, while eating at Eddie's. I'm thinking this means one ages faster (bad). However, this has not been independently verified. ;) Last, I have to say something about the service. Sometimes, when eating at higher-end establishments, the service is almost ""too servicing."" ""Yes, sir, no sir, let me wipe your mouth sir, I can't talk to you like I'm a human, sir, it's against the rules."" Not so, here. Very professional and knowledgable service, yet friendly and fun. We even got surprised with a free dessert for being a ""fun table!"" (And no, she didn't know I'd be Yelping. Or, maybe she did. Who cares! Same result!)

 The best kept secret in Henderson! Moderately expensive and definitely worth every penny you spend. If you are looking for typical Mexican food you have come to the wrong place. This is reasonably priced fare for a slightly more sophisticated palate. Sabor provides you with culinary masterpieces that create a whole new experience for your taste buds. I have been five times in two months and have thoroughly enjoyed each entree I've tried. While I have my favorites (the Chicken Poblano has an amazing flavor that you simply cannot forget) my wife prefers the Blackened Arrachera. The food at Sabor creates more of a dining experience, one that you will cherish, rather than just satisfying your appetite. The chef, Scott, definitely knows what he is doing and the waiters and other staff are both efficient and friendly. Do yourself a favor, this is a dining experience that you will usually have to travel to a five star resort restaurant and it's tucked away in a quiet corner of Henderson. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Customer service has always been nice to me on purchases; I haven't ever tried returns there. Selection is iffy. We recently went there for shower curtain liners and they only had one size, that was about six inches too long and two holes shy of fitting a standard shower/tub setup in a standard house. And if you're looking for food, the frozen pizza selection isn't very good either. I try to avoid shopping at Target whenever possible because they pay their employees less than Walmart, and the only people I know who do work or have worked there in the past said it was not a good work environment.

 Fuck you Cox. Seriously, fuck you. If I could give you no stars I would I contacted them before I moved to try and get TV and Internet service. This was all done online, easy, and simple. Until the next day when I got an e-mail response that my order was canceled. They did not tell me why, only said to call to find out more information. Why was it canceled? Oh because someone used my middle and last name and my social to open an account THREE YEARS AGO. So let's see: it's a fraudulent account that owes them money, but they didn't even check names or addresses? Their excuse was that, ""technology was different three years ago"". I call bullshit. So here is what they tell me: call our local fraud hotline, and they will give you the steps you need to take. I did this, but the problem is the fraud department doesn't have a hotline, they have an answering machine. Any call you make to them goes directly to voicemail. They have to call YOU. It took them 4 days to call me back, but before that I was fed up and called the main line back who told me I could go to the offices for more information. I drove all the way across town to their office that gave me a fraud packet. When the fraud department called me back, you know what they were going to do? Just send me a damn fraud packet. So I fill out the packet completely. I get a police report, get documents, etc. I send it via certified mail with return requested to the address they had on the packet, and not for cheap. What happens? THE LETTER IS RETURNED TO ME. Apparently even though they told me to send it certified to the address given, they won't accept it. My mother then faxed all 8 pages TWICE to them, but still with no confirmation. I still don't know if my fraud packet ever got to them. They also wouldn't let me request service during the 30 day period they would need in order to rectify my fraud issues, so I moved without TV or Internet. Well even if it does come back and my slate is clean with Cox, they can go suck their own name because I would never, ever do business with a shady monopoly of a company that obviously is so greedy that they do not help those who are willing to pay for service, but just accept accounts with the bare minimum of information and will not help you when they have screwed you over completely. Their customer service is bogus and their fraud department even more so: I would be amazed to find out if there were more than one person actually working there. I will never do business with this company and hope no one else does either. ",1,0,0,0,0

 There are so many pastry shops to choose from now on this street. I was determined to try as many as I could within the short time I was visiting Montreal. Callia stood out in my mind because they have a larger selection of crispy pastrys with meat fillings, as well as many of the bun varieties. I had my eye on all of the curry filled pastries and tried one of each. They were not as flavorful as I was hoping for and I recommend reheating in a toaster oven instead of the microwave. The bacon and onion bun gave me a stomach ache for a couple of days, which made it difficult to sample further. I was not able to try their bubble teas, but I did like the passion fruit bottled tea.

 Ok, so let me start with... I LOVE Cirque du Soleil. I have seen at least 10 different ones. 'O' is one of my least favorites. I don't think the show is bad, it's just not for me. So, this is why.... I LOVE water. I love to swim, but why is this show so much diving? I feel like I'm at a diving and swimming competition. I got so sick of the same old thing in this show. I think there is just only so much you can do with water. It seemed like the different scenes were very disparate. I wanted this show to be really good, but they rely to heavily on the water gimmick. In most Cirque shows, there is a 'oh my gosh' feeling, and this one just doesn't have it. The theatre is beautiful and comfortable. The ceiling is amazing. The stage/pool is amazing, I can't believe that they have a pool this size with all the engineering behind it in the Bellagio. It's amazing. The costumes (especially the black and white ones) are great! We stayed at the Bellagio and planned well in advance. The Bellagio has tickets set aside that you can purchase in a Bellagio guest section. Our seats were great. I'm glad I went but I wouldn't ever go back (like I have with Ka and Mystere) therefore the 3 stars. I'm glad I saw it, because I love Cirque. I wouldn't go back.

Jan is also very funny and has some great facial expressions during the show. There is a lot of interaction with the audience and some great laughs. There were more people in the audience than the first time I saw him, but Jan still spent time after the show talking with people and taking pictures. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I'd like to review the bar portion (A Bar) of this restaurant at this time, and I'll come back to the restaurant part at a later date. First of all, the bar here is pretty nice. I like the feel of the place, and it has more of a lounge feel than a bar feel. I don't know if that makes sense, but what I mean to say is that the chairs are more comfortable, service comes to you, and it's not a place you pop into for one drink and you're gone in thirty seconds. Secondly, they seem to have a pretty decent bartender there all the time. So while some of the other bars inside the Texas do ok, this place blows them out of the water. Also, they seem to have higher-end alcohol here. Again, it's in sharp contrast to the other bars here. Finally, they have a great selection of food to dish out. Not only do they have sliders and the like, but they can also serve anything from the restaurant if you ask nicely. I love the food at the restaurant here, but I'd much rather eat and drink inside the restaurant than the outside bar potion. All in all, it was great service, though a little pricey. Still, I'll definitely come back. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Terrible service all around! We were told there would be an hour wait- but we ended up waiting two hours before leaving (after paying for mandatory lifetime memberships). They were either understaffed for had incompetent employees. During our wait, we decided to get a few drinks at the bar. We sat at the bar for several minutes before being acknowledged. After placing our order, the one bartender was very slow and forgetful. I would not waste my time going back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Russell is the kind of business owner that makes you feel at home in his restaurant. At home as in giving you the TV remote to change the channel, bringing you boiled peanuts when you politely decline (and then letting you take the peanuts home because you didn't finish them) and chatting with you when things have calmed down for him. And it certainly doesn't hurt that the food is delicious as well! During my visits I've gotten three banchan: radish, kimchi and bean sprouts. All of it delicious, all of it hard to not ask for refills; gotta save room for the entrees! I've had the Dolsot Bibimbap and the Fish Jun. The Bibimbap delivers well, and the Fish Jun portion is huge! Two very large filets battered and fried. Not only was Russell generous with the fish, he also kept offering to bring me more rice when he saw I had eaten it all! He seriously wants to do everything in his power to make sure you enjoy your meal, and he does that with flying colors. ",0,0,0,1,0

 ""Lowering Cane's expectations"" should be the name. They have just set the bar low on food quality and taste. No seasoning at all in the breading of the chicken fingers and the fries seem like they came straight from your grocer's freezer. Must not have thought much of their dog if this is their tribute to him. Just drove away disappointed. Want my junk food to taste good if I'm going to splurge with this type of caloric intake. Only positive was stellar Drive-Thru service and the place seemed pretty clean. Don't waste your time. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We went there on Sunday night. We usually love going to Westgate Center to get a drink and appetizer and window shop a bit before going to the movies. I could not believe how disgusting that place was. The bathroom was so gross! Toilet paper all over the floors, and the mirrors looked like they had not been cleaned in a long time! No paper towels to dry your hands, either. I had to go out to the popcorn area for paper towels! The butter stations were just as bad! They had not been wiped down at all. There was food & oil all over the place. I mean, seriously, we are talking a Sunday night when it was dead in there!! Employees were standing around talking to each other! I was so turned off by the mess, that I will avoid going to that theatre again. It's a shame, since that is a nice area, with good restaurants and shopping. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I ordered the milk tea with boba, which was PRETTY BAD. I was a little disappointed because it's run by an asian family from San Francisco, so I thought they might've had some knowledge of how milk tea tastes from the bay area, but NOPE. They use powder and I couldn't even taste the tea. Any person who has ever tasted ANY milk tea drink from the good land (by good land I mean CA) will probably find this place awful. If your taste buds have only had milk tea in AZ then you will find this place good. I couldn't even finish my drink (nor force it down), but they were nice so I didn't have the heart to throw it away in front of them...I waited till i got home and dumped it down the sink. I'm a cheap asian person too, so throwing something away unfinished that i paid for says a lot. Also they gave us free donuts, which tasted okay. It might do them better to change the store name to just ""Donuts"" so people don't come here for boba drinks and give them bad reviews. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I agree with everyone that gave this place 1 star. We used them at the end of April while visiting Phoenix and didn't have any problems so we decided to use them again last week. We were only going to be in town for 2 days so the estimated cost was $160 for a mid size. When we get to the rental desk the agent tries to upsell us on a convertible. It's mid August in PHOENIX, ARIZONA and he wants us to drive off in a freaking convertible. So after he adds me as a driver and tacks on the insurance the total comes to $391!!!!!!!!!! A mid size car for 2 days and you're going to charge us $391!!!!!!! We asked what time do we need to return the car on Thursday before being charged an extra day. He seemed bothered, but he said 12:45. We also went with the basic insurance. We returned the car at 12:40 with a full tank of gas. Our total was $191.00 If after reading this review and all the other negative reviews you still decide to rent from Thrifty, read the fine print and have the agent explain to you what you are being charged and why.

 The food here is pretty good but horrible service. We went for lunch on Monday and stopped in about 11:15. After ordering one person waited 50 minutes for their lunch. The table next to us waited just as long. We asked where our food was each time the waitress came by and they said there was a problem. After asking the 4th time and asking to speak to a manager, they said the manager was busy. If you don't mind waiting 50 plus minutes for lunch this is the place for you. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I wish I did a walk through before booking a room here. I'm in my suite, on my bed as I write this review. Vdara seems like a 4 star hotel when you initially walk in, however you soon realize that this hotel is not all that it seems. The service is a solid three. Nobody was rude, everyone was friendly and helpful, but there were instances where it lacked precision, poise and confidence. An example of this would be with the concierge. I called them to ask about about having a messenger pick up a BB Tour charger and deliver to the suite. Over the phone, he was very helpful and said that I should come downstairs to check their chargers to see if any one of them worked. I don't mean to sound like a princess, but I honestly did NOT want to walk my lazy ass downstairs. I had been working all day setting up our booth for a trade show and just wanted someone to come up and show me the chargers so I can pick the one that fits and put my feet up and RELAX. So I walk my lazy butt downstairs to the concierge and find her helping another guest. I wait for 5 minutes and can't wait longer so walk over to the front desk and they of course tell me to go back to the concierge. I'm back in line behind the same couple asking all sorts of questions about some show seating. I wait another 5 minutes and the concierge looks over to me says that she will be awhile and asks me what I needed in a slight annoyed and definitely hurried fashion. I tell her another concierge told me to come down to pick up a charger. She then literally dumps a bunch of chargers my way and tells me to choose one. By this time I'm feeling like I interrupted Mommy and Daddy at a really busy time. WTF!!! Anyways, none of the chargers fit so I walked my ass to the business center as a just in case and surely they had one that fit. Initially they told me to leave my phone there while it was being charged, but I asked if I could take the charger up to my room, since I needed my phone for business. They said no problem and I gave them my room number and happily left that I didn't have to pay for a brand new one. When I got back to my room later that evening, I had a message from the business center saying that if I wanted to keep the charger for the duration of my stay, they would charge me $5 a day. I still don't know how I really feel about that. I screwed up and forgot my charger, but I just don't feel good about it. The rooms are nice. It seems impressive, but again it's an illusion. For example, the sunken in oval bath tub is nice. Visually it looks porcelain, but it's plastic. The LIGHTS!!! WTF is up with the lights. The switch turned on the ALL the lights, but you couldn't turn on the side lamps by the couches unless the main lights were on. It was weird. They do have a kitchen and I guess it would be useful if you were cooking, but didn't need any utensils or plates or even kitchenware to cook your food in. This is HIGH CLASS CAVE MAN LIVING!! Seriously, what were they thinking!! Who is gonna book room at a nice hotel and bring all the kitchenware with them??!! The place just didn't make sense! Housekeeping is a 3 at best. They came and cleaned the rooms, but our tub was dirty. We had a epsom salt bath the night before and when we got back to our room, we realized that the tub was still had epsom salt stuck to the bottom of it. The Q-tips and cotton balls weren't replaced and the toiletry in the shower wasn't put away. All the other housekeeping service did this in every other hotel we stayed in including MGM, Wynn, and Luxor. The ONE restaurant that VDARA has is NOT open for dinner. I can understand why. The restaurant is just entirely BORING! They probably can't afford to leave it open, since there may be all of 2 tables booked for the entire place. The BEST thing about Vdara was the spa. We booked a couple's massage and our masseuse were fantastic. Really enjoyed that!! All in all, this hotel is for guests who are in Vegas strictly for business. If you want pleasure with your business go somewhere else. If a non-gaming hotel is what your looking for, Four Seasons may be in order! i guess you get what you pay for. The rooms are pretty cheap for what you get. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This course is awesome. I'm a junior and they treat me so well here. The rates are reasonable, the location is prime, the view is amazing. I enjoy playing here at Aliante every time I come to Vegas. Al in the pro shop is a great guy, and the caddies are friendly and professional. I wrote a bad review before but after my experience today I'm updating it. You can't beat that classic mountain view! This course is tough with plenty of rough areas but if you hit a good tee shot you'll be fine on every hole. If you are traveling and staying on the strip, this course is somewhat far up in North Las Vegas. You'll have to take the 215 hwy or do what I did and take RTC bus 119. It's at Koval/Harmon and goes straight to the course! Today I played 27 holes, had breakfast, and hit a bucket for only $30. Where else can you get that deal? ",0,0,0,0,1

 It's a gorgeous restaurant, no doubt about it, and the food was good, but it was just so dang pricey for what we got I can't say I was a totally happy camper. After deciding to say no to the 2+ hour wait for the Bacchanal Buffet, my two friends and I went roaming about Caesar's Palace for something more suitable. We saw the inviting environs of Nobu and thought a semi-fancy dinner would be OK. We were seated right away, which was great, and looked over the menu while soaking in the cool modern artsy asian ambiance. Good thing we weren't that hungry, otherwise the damage would've been greater. We got an order of their Yellowtail Jalapeno appetizer, two orders of the Black Cod Miso with the lettuce cup preparation for easier sharing, and Beef skewers with the Anticucho sauce. I THINK we also got the chicken skewers too but now I can't remember. At any rate, everything was delicious; I'm not saying anything was bad, but we each ended up paying almost $50 (with tax and tip) for these little nibblies. The worst was the black cod miso--you get three measly bites per order, so that was $68 for two bites/per person, wow. Maybe I'm a Philistine when it comes to fine dining, but this stuck in my craw (har har). My only other experience at a Nobu was at the West Hollywood one during Dine LA and that was a great deal, so now I know that this just isn't the place for me at regular prices. Live, eat, and learn.

 Well I'm going to put my timeshare 2-cents on here like everyone else. While these guys did put us up @ the swanky Palazzo, it's not guaranteed. We were told a 2-3hr presentation, & we were trapped a half hr away from our hotel for 5.5 hrs!!! We were ushered through 5 different meetings/interviews, 5! These used car salesmen should be ashamed of themselves. They came off as desperate, pushy, sleazy, & just plain obnoxious. i get that they are trying to sell there condos but, there are way easier, smoother, more respectable ways to do it. The suites @ the Grandview are very clean, fully furnished, & seem convenient. The timeshare concept does make sense, and is a good idea for some people. However, my gf & I are creative professionals in our mid-twenties still dealing with school loans and such. The idea that we would have the resources to utilize 3-4 weeks of vacation time a year, is laughable. BE WARNED. I'm glad we were forced into this semi-free mini vacation but, I'm not sure I'd do it again. Although many people clearly do. Our brains were mush after we were done, she napped for several hrs while I blew $60 on the casino floor. These guys added to my overall sleazy impression of Vegas. ",1,0,0,0,0

 So from the reviews I went to this sorry establishment. I actually created an account just to write about this nasty place. Beware: They are hidden under the guise of a chinese restaurant. So I took my boyfriend and his friend, both white yet have a pallette for good chinese food. The first sign this place might be a problem: No chinese patrons! ALL white people and I mean all white except for me and the staff. I have to admit we went there twice just to confirm our initial opinion. Food is not fresh, they lie when they say the fish dish is 50% off. Really??!! $19 for a fried fish. Do you mean to tell me that the fish was originally $38. No respectable chinese person would ever pay $38 for a fried fish, even 19 bucks for this low grade, rotten tasting fish. Yuck! It tasted like it had been sitting in sewer water. I also had chow fun, garlic spinach, minced pork with salty fish, roast duck and won ton soup. The only good dish was the won ton soup. How pathetic! I could tell the food is not fresh. I agree with a previous reviewer when he was wondering where all the duck meat was on the supposed duck.. All I got was greasy skin and bones. My journey for great, off the strip chinese food continues. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Overpriced is the first word that comes to mind. And the word that dominates my feelings toward this place. They never mentioned that the ""KING"" in the name actually means you have to be as RICH as a REAL KING to afford to eat here. $13.95 for a ( relatively forgettable ) simple oyster Po' Boy with 5 oysters on it and a side of fries? Yep. Who's dumber - me for paying it, or them for charging it? I think Me. When I saw the price, I should have just closed the menu and left. I also had a $6.95 ""Cajun Bloody Mary"" which had nothing Cajun about it, as far as I could tell. It was mostly ice, served in a 16-oz glass. So maybe about 6 ounces of ""drink material"" inside. It lasted about as long as it took me to take 5 drinks out of it. Let's do the math: At $6.95, with 6 ounces of substance, that comes to $148.26 per gallon. So at least I can say I had a Bloody Mary which came in at around $148 a gallon. I will never, EVER go back to that place. And if you do go, bring the credit card with the highest available balance, because you are gonna need it. P.S. A manager attempted to contact me after seeing this review, trying to make things right for me. I understand their prices reflect the ""going rate"" for fresh seafood in the desert. I've upped the star from 1 to 2 to reflect the respect for management for trying to contact me and make things right. Kudos for that. P.S.P.S. I had Pete's Fish and Chips the other day, and I realized that their fried oysters are the EXACT SAME ONES which are served at King's Fish House. So if you want to know what these fried oysters taste like, eat at Pete's. You can get about 15 oysters there for the King's price. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've been meaning to start writing Yelp reviews for a while now, and I've repeatedly considered what business would receive my first review. I've decided that it HAS to be the Peppermill and it HAS to be five stars. (For this review, I'm focusing strictly on the lounge.) My wife and I are Las Vegas locals now, but we've been frequenting the Fireside Lounge since our tourist days. We came here on the night we got engaged. We came here on the night we got married. We come here on our birthdays and anniversaries. There simply isn't any place in town more comfortable and romantic for a couple of kitsch lovers like us. Sure, the strip location means it gets crowded on the weekends - moreso lately than it used to, it seems - but scoring a seat on one of the plush pink couches around the firepit makes it more than worth the trip. The waitresses are super-friendly and they'll remember you between visits. My only complaints are that the drinks are a little weak and the music selection a little poppy. The former is because I've been conditioned by super-strong Fink Bombs at Frankie's Tiki Room, and the latter is because I'm apparently a hipster douche. Neither complaint is worth tarnishing a perfect score. The Peppermill is easily one of our favorite places on the entire globe and now it's only a couple of miles down the street from us. We're so lucky to now live so close to this neon-encrusted gem. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I got a groupon for 6 cupcakes at Gigi's and I was really excited to use it because I love cupcakes. I knew from reading the fine print that the group on was only able to be used on four flavors of cupcakes, even though they had several more available at the store. So it wasn't a surprise to me, but I still think that is lame and doesn't make any sense. I bought my six cupcakes and they looked beautiful, the frosting was perfect. I gave one to my son first, who typically inhales cupcakes, preferring the cake to the frosting. It was a huge red flag to me when he gobbled down most of the frosting but didn't touch the cake part at all. I had mine after dinner and could see why as soon as I bit into it... the cake part is terrible. It is thick and spongey, hard to chew and does not taste good at all. I couldn't even eat it, which says a lot because I am a person who will happily eat supermarket cupcakes and enjoy them. The frosting was good, but when you eat it by itself it isn't great anymore. This was a waste of money, even as a groupon... Steer clear. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This place was really good. A little pricey, every time we ordered something shed put in one number which was on the menu and then add a few more cents-a dollar which was kinda shady since we actually removed stuff from what we wanted (no sour cream, no cheese etc) The staff was not friendly. I talked to two girls neither one even spoke except to tell me my total, or that our order was ready. The chips were pretty expensive $3 something but really tasty. Salsa selection sucked. They have one red and one green both liquids, no chunky salsa or any other kind, just super hot red saucy stuff and green saucy stuff. There were a lot of other condiments, there were green onions, radishes, cucumbers jalape \ u00f1os, and carrots. Overall I really liked this place and I'm glad we found it and that its 24hrs!

 Great value - I ate my heart out and paid 35 dollars including tip. Same meal would probably be 50 bucks in Los Angeles. This place is ran by Japanese people and I found their stuff is more authentic than most. I'm sick of places that has random ppl making sushi because they either: put too much rice in the nigiri..the rice is too sour or the fish cut is too thin/thick. Fish tastes relatively fresh...not the best but def. not the worst. I'd give it a 8/10. This still caters to the traditional Americans who want an assortment of rolls but for those that just want some good old nigiri - you can't beat this place. Place is relatively large so seating is pretty quick. ",0,0,0,1,0

 It's small and smokey. I mean you walk into a cloud of cigarette smoke. I couldn't run out of the cloud fast enough. We moved to the other side of the casino and it wasn't as smokey.

The bad- the school has been adding ""class fees"" to all the classes, so they can say that tuition is $71 a credit hour but then you have a $10 class fee making a that 3 credit hour class $223 not $213. they've also started charging students to print at the High tech centers, $.10 per page, they haven't done that before.

 5 stars for a chain? Really? Ok yes, it's amazing how many people mistake it for authentic Mexican food and don't know that it was previously bought and then spun off again by McDonalds. But it is what it is - quick, made to order burritos and tacos. It's also reliable, great tasting, fresh and high quality. The chicken and beef never creep me out like some mom and pop taco shops around town. The best thing about standing in line and ordering here is you can see your meal being made and ask for exactly what you want on it. Customizing your chow has never been easier or more fun. Chicken with corn salsa, black beans and guac on your burrito? Why not?! The guacamole and corn salsa both have too many red onions imho. But other than that I really like Chipotle. Their chips are made on premises, crispy, lightly salted with a dash of lime juice. And I often get the guac anyway because it tastes so fresh. I get the crispy (vs soft) shell tacos often. And I had not tried a barbacoa burrito before visiting a Chipotle. Now I recognize it on Mexican menus everywhere. So they helped me branch out and enjoy something different. How's that for a raving fan review? I just like these guys. Pronunciation note from the corporate website: pronounced chi-POAT-lay ",0,0,0,0,1

 I really wanted to love this place... Two of us stopped in today for lunch after hearing all of the good reviews. I needed to use the restroom. The hostess handed me a dirty spatula with a key attached and said the restroom was outside around the corner...ummm OK. The restroom has no AC. Great in the summer! We asked for a few minuets to look over the huge menu. We didn't see the server for another 10 minuets. We ordered two things to split. The first was the Grilled Steak Pita. It is steak with mushrooms and Swiss cheese. They are not kidding. That is all that is on it. It was really bland, but OK I guess. The other choice was the Bleu Danube. It has Grilled turkey breast and ham blended with bleu cheese and topped with Swiss cheese (copied from the menu). It is a HUGE portion. My half had a TON of blue cheese sauce on it... too much. It was way overwhelming. It also seemed very salty. You might as well drink warm blue cheese dressing. It took a really long time to get our food and bill. Don't go here if you are in a hurry for lunch. I'm just bummed. I really wanted to dig this place. Oh Well... The dessert case looked good... ",0,1,0,0,0

 Tried on a whim while in Pittsburgh for first time. Food was superb--risotto, seared morocan tuna, and chicken--and they had a great wine selection. The ""chocolate"" dessert was delicious...might make me come back to Pittsburgh! Service was excellent. The ambiance was relaxed and to romantic. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I actually ate first in July following a surgery. Then after a couple of more surgeries in August. These folks accommodated my dietary restrictions and were so welcoming and friendly. Of course DOC was the Keno Runner. Great guy! Then this Christmas we stayed again and were treated like the Royalty we have always pretended to be. The Suis Chef, Jennifer, came and visited us, Paige Elizabeth (also our granddaughter's name) waited on us on the morning, and Daune waited on us in the very, very early morning. These folks are wonderful ambassadors for the Grand Cafe. Oh! Don't forget Freddy, who supported these others like a great director of the theatre. I'll will be back many times. In fact, today! The food is good cafe faire, the service is great, the atmosphere welcoming. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Had an interesting experience here. Met up with a few friends to this small but apparently very popular thai restaurant next to Commonwealth (the new hot bar in downtown Vegas) and The Griffin. We got a table fairly quickly ordered drinks and food, which both came fast. The hostess was a cold cold girl who seemingly had little love of life. Waiter was nice guy. Food was solid. Nothing to write home about but what do you expect in a fun thai place like that? Things got a bit interesting when 6 others associated with our group wanted to join and take over the table next to us. Unfortunately there was a line. The awful, ostentatious girl sitting next to me who frequented the toilet several times during our meal offered to pay the bill of the large table next to us if they got up immediately and gave the table to her friends that had arrived. The level of excess in this one was beyond what I had seen and that is saying a lot. Obviously this resulted in a back and forth with the dragon lady, our waiter, and this spoiled brat who was used to getting everything her way. I was embarrassed to be associated. She did eventually get her wish. My friend and I wanted nothing to do with these people so quickly got the bill. I am not fully sure, but I am fairly confident that our waiter stole one the twenties I put on the pill and acted as if I had only put one twenty in the check. Again cannot prove it but I know that I put two down (my friend can verify). Oh well. Overall mixed experience but is a fun place in a good location if you are going out downtown. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Thank God for tourists and trendy people wanting trendy cupcakes. Without either this place would flop!!! I always see a line out the door and figured that Sprinkles cupcakes HAD to be amazing. I live right down the street and find myself walking by quite often, but after 3 visits and 3 mediocre cupcakes I realized why there is always a 15 minute wait; the teenagers that work behind the counter are ill trained and take longer to put a cupcake in a box, than it does Starbucks to make a complex specialty coffee. To top it off, each time I visited, the overprices cupcakes were hardly stocked and I had to settle for my second choice. The cakes tasted decent but were a touch dry. Fun to look at but not much more. Don't get me wrong, I love cupcakes as much as the next 30's something hipster yuppie, but had it not been for an extraordinary location with a high volume of tourist based pedestrian traffic, Sprinkles would not be making it based on the quality of their cupcakes. It is a good thing for them that everyone that walks by this location is transient. The idea is great but this company would not survive on local business alone. The owners are very fortunate that they have been able to ride the coattails of other trendy and worthy cupcake companies. Had the cupcake trend not existed before Sprinkles opened, they surely would not have started the trend themselves, and would have fizzed out within months of opening ",0,1,0,0,0

 I went to Yokoso for Valentine's day with my girlfriend for an afternoon cocktail and some sushi before catching a flick at the theater. We ventured into the deserted steakhouse and sat down by the bar around 2:00, expecting to catch a movie at 3:30. The menu was definitely a little overwhelming at first, so we both ordered a drink to review each others' palates for sushi. My girlfriend ordered a banana split martini and was very delighted with her choice. I noticed that they had some different types of Japanese beer on tap. I ordered the Kirin and happened to love its light, refreshing taste. After deciphering the menu, my lover ordered the paradise roll, which was an eight cut roll that included crab, avocado, and shrimp. I ordered the spicy tuna, which was also an eight roll that included yellow fin tuna, avocado, and crab. Both of our dishes were delicious. In a fantasy sushi oasis, I couldn't picture sushi tasting any better. And for everything, we paid around $30.00. So, it was definitely an awesome way to catch a drink and a meal before a movie.

 I agree with the other reviewers that there is less produce here than you would expect and what they do have is overpriced... though it looked great. But there are still a lot of other yummy food related offerings. And it's still a great shop local opportunity. I loved being able to buy some homemade salsa and popsicles from my fellow Arizonans.

 My cousins wanted to go somewhere I haven't taken them before, since I wanted to try this place, we decided to check it out. When we first walked in, it was a chill atmosphere, since I haven't been here before so I didn't know what to expect. My cousin and brother ordered beer and hot sake since it was buy one get one for 50% during their happy hour from 4pm-9pm. We ended up ordering their chicken wings (supreme & soy garlic), kimchi fried rice, and bulgogi. They were good, but not the best. When you check in for the first time, you get a free shaved ice per table, which is really good. And when you write a review, you'll get a free cold sake. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Best baked potatoes in Edinburgh!! Tucked away near the uni, it's always busy at lunchtime, but you never have to wait long.

 Hellooooooo...... :echo... echo...: Myself and three other customers were waiting in line for about ten minutes with no one behind the counter. Not a sign, not a shout from someone in the back. Just a counter and delicious donuts mocking me... Just out of reach. What a frustrating experience. I even left, went next door and came back to see that people were STILL waiting for assistance. I eventually gave up. No donut for me. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Just came in to check it out, wanted to look into some accessory. Now I know I don't look like anyone who knows how to handle any musical equipment. But you don't have to treat me that way. Yes it was busy, but no one even asked if I was looking for something or if I needed any help. When I finally did ask someone a question, felt like I was bothering him. One good thing is, Guitar Center had a very wide selection. Almost anything you need. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've always used the drive through at this location, in the morning time. Have never had any problems. Customer service always good. Order always correct. Sounds like 5 stars or close to it, right? Well this morning, I am hungry, and opt for a classic chicken burrito. No lettuce. Extra cheese. Extra chicken. All was well until I was about 1/3 of the way into it and I look down and notice I was eating a burrito with RAW chicken. I called the store and spoke with a manager named Maria. She was so so, offered to have me come back and make another burrito. I declined for obvious reasons and stated I was now at work and cannot come back. I told her I just wanted my money back for the burrito. She said she would like me to bring it back so she can see and speak with her cooks about it because they might not believe her. Really? Ok. I kind felt like she was calling me a liar. I told her that I've been cooking for years and I'm pretty sure I know raw chicken when I see it and she should talk to her cook immediately so other patrons aren't served raw chicken. So I inform her I am not off until 4pm, she tells me to come in after work, with the burrito, and she will update the manager on duty at that time of the situation. So fast forward to about 5pm. I come back with my burrito from the AM. The gal at the register initially was nice and gets the manager or shift supervisor who then leaves whatever she was helping to cook and walks up nonchalantly to the register, she then proceeds to throw the burrito in the trash (WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT IT, doesn't wanna see the photo on my phone either), gives me back $6 and then gives me back my receipt copy (after I have to ask for it). Did she talk to me once during the transaction? Nope. Just kept her head down and talked to the register (no it didn't answer back). Had i received better customer service in response to bringing raw chicken to their attention, I probably would've rated this store higher. The reason I give even 3 starts after a raw chicken experience is because my past experiences here have always been pleasant. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Horrible airline. Flight was delayed by 45 minutes. Employees at the counter could get a personality. Pilot could not decide if he needs to turn left or right during flight. Extra fees for baggage and carry on. Taxes tacked on to each checked bag. Upcharge of 25 for overweight bags that weigh over 40 lbs. I highly recommend not to use this airline unless you are desparate. The boarding gate area was nasty with garbage everywhere. They ask you on the flight to pick up other people's trash. 1 star is too kind for this airline, but that is the min rating. ",1,0,0,0,0

 When: Friday night dinner, 9:00 Crowd: BUSY. But bar does not get too overcroweded. Which is good because its a small bar. Restaurant setting: Sleek, modern feel. Narrow restaurant with a small bar in the front. Great outdoor seating. Really, not built for large groups as most tables are 2 or 4 tops. We had a group of 8, and where placed in the very front window, just near the front door and before the bar. Not a highly desirable location. Menu: Some very intriguing items on the menu. Range from pates, fish, and beef. The chef recommended the special ribeye for 2 or 3. It was pricey at $75, however if split among 3 its reasonable and MUCH more delicious than the basic flank steak on the menu. The 1 kilo of ribeye, came with some mixed green (salad) two cups of frites, and a very good bernaise. It was AWESOME! Also, not to be forgotten was the vegetable of the day. Corn on the Cob from Quebec. May be the best corn on the cob I've ever had. Enjoyed - The Ribeye for Two (or three) and the Corn Especially! Others at the table had the Steak Frites (Flank Steak) and enjoyed it, just not as much as the Ribeye. Other: On the downside, service was very slow. It took almost 30 minutes to get our cocktails after we ordered them, and a very long time for the final bill. Also, dang it was HOT in that restaurant. Waiter was very nice, however. Nutshell: Very good restaurant. Pricey though. Might suggest a week night and outdoor seating over a busy weekend. ",0,0,1,0,0

 After an 8 mile bike ride along the Flamingo Wash, I used Yelp to find the nearest Starbucks and this was it. I don't generally do drive throughs so I parked in their small lot and went inside the store. I ordered my drink, it was ready quickly, and I enjoyed part of it while checking my email on their free wifi. The staff was very pleasant and on the ball. I can't say I'll be stopping here often, but it fit my needs yesterday! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've not been making good choices lately about where to dine. I have been dying to go to Sucker Punch since they announced the resturant. I figured the location would be great and the old Ruby Tuesday's would be a clean slate for them to build a really cool restaurant out of. Boy, was I wrong. Having been in that Ruby Tuesday before, it was obvious they put a coat of paint on it, recovered the booths, and put a minimal amount of their own very repetitive art. Suffice to say, the restaurant looks like shit. It's not cool and divey like a diner should be, and it's not pretty and upscale either, it's just like someone put lipstick on a pig and called it a day. I was actually almost at the point of wanting to walk out. The way they decorated this place and the lack of effort to build out the restaurant screamed that my meal was going to be terrible. I ordered the Denver Omelette and my girlfriend ordered a cheeseburger. We both commented on the lack of selection on the menu. You can have either traditional breakfasts, omeletts, burgers, or three different entrees. I think I counted 11 selections on the menu. The food here is TERRIBLE. My omelette was a big soaking pile of grease, with terrible quality ingredients. I swear this is true.... I've had better omeletts at IHOP and Denny's. The hash browns were average to good, but then again they were hash browns. Biscuits, terrible, and they didn't bring me honey or butter or anything. The burger looked very bad too. The shape of the burger was about 2 inches tall and 3 inches wide. There was so much bun outside of the burger. It just was not made properly. They definitely fucked up something as easy as a hamburger ordered medium that was dry as a bone and a gross dark gray color. Our server was nice, and that's about the only saving grace, but she was terribly inexperienced and didn't properly bring our meal, condiments, or drinks. I understand this place just opened, but the inside of the restaurant is an absolute joke and the menu is bad. I don't think those are two things that are going to just improve over time. The service and food quality both can improve, but they will have to a lot in order for it to survive, because right now this place is an abortion. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I love walking through this lovely hotel. From the moment I hit the lobby with its brightly colored floral light fixture, to watching the fountain show, to walking through the shops, to eating some of their great food, I love it. I haven't stayed here yet, but perhaps someday, I will. In the meantime, I come here everytime I'm in town. It's elegant and beautiful, and I love going at night all dressed up. ",0,0,0,1,0
