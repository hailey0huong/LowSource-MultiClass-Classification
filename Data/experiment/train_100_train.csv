 I'm a 21 year old male from Texas who just created a yelp for the sole purpose of upping this rating. Zarkana is the only cirq show that I have ever seen and I can't believe the poor reviews it is getting. Granted I have nothing to compare it to so maybe my 5 stars are because It is the only one I have seen. So to those who have never seen a cirq show, you will have an amazing time. Music: 5/5 The thing that stood out to me the most was the live music. It was incredible. The lead female character has the best singing voice I have ever heard. The noises that came out of her beautiful face made me want to cry and laugh at the same time. At other times the music pumped me up the same way rocky balboa gets pumped up to ""Eye of the Tiger"" by survivor. Right when you think it can't get better, BAM, The drums lead into a shredded guitar solo, and the acrobats perform their most difficult tricks. If this show was just a concert with no acts I would still have given it 5 stars. Acts: 5/5 Very intense at times, and majestic at others. My favorite was the wheel of death because of how scary it is to watch, but all were impressive. I was gnawing at my fingernails like there's no tomorrow. The story: ?/5 I have absolutely no idea what was happening with the story but this didn't keep me from being drawn in. This is where I can see how cirq goers would knock a star off. The clowns: 3/5 Pretty annoying but sometimes funny. Mostly annoying though. I kinda wanted to slap him. If you hate having fun, this show is not for you. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Guys, I hate whiskey but will drink Wigle. From my up-front honesty, I'll say Landlocked Spiced and Giniver are two of my absolute favorite drinks right now. The staff is extremely inviting and knowledgeable on each of the spirits in their collection. My favorite combos are the Landlocked Spice with limeade and aromatic bitters OR with ginger beer. Can't go wrong with these guys! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've been checking out the different food trucks at Phoenix Public Market's Food Truck Fridays. Note: Be ready for a wait at all of the trucks. But on a beautiful spring afternoon, it's not a bad thing. Today I tried Jamburritos for the first time. They had an interesting and wide selection of items, from fried catfish to creole chicken quesadillas. I chose the chicken K-Tacos. Three spicy chicken street tacos with cabbage and black bean salsa. Wow. Great flavor. Enough spice to clean out my sinuses without fear of burning my taste buds. The guy taking orders was cheerful and pleasant. I also enjoyed the variety of beverages available. I chose a Tamarind soda. Yum. I'm looking forward to trying more items on the menu before Food Truck Friday ends when the heat rises. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I bought a Kitchen Aid Mixer on December 6th at the Kitchen Collection Store at the Outlet Mall in Carlsbad, CA. It was given to my son and his wife for Christmas. When they got it out of the (NEW) box to use it, as the beaters turned, it made grinding noises. I called the KC in Carlsbad and explained what happened and that my son lives in Phoenix. They said to take it in with the receipt to any of the Arizona KC stores. My son and his wife and baby took a 40 mile trip to go to the Kitchen Collection store at Anthem. The experience they had was way less than pleasant. After lugging the Mixer in and presenting it (in the box with everything it came with) and the receipt to the person workiing at their register, my son was told that they don't take returns or exchanges on the kitchen aid items. My son told her what I had been told and also showed her on the bottom of the receipt that stated they DO accept returns and exchanges and she told him it was Company Policy not to do so on Kitchen Aid appliances. He asked if she had that policy in writing and she said ""NO, it is an understood policy and is not in writing."" After trying to talk with her and ask to speak with someone else, she was still rude. They were not nice and not helpful and did not follow the policy stated on their receipt. My son left with his Kitchen Aid Mixer, went home, called Kitchen Aid's 800 number and they are sending him a new one. Sad experience and the money I would have saved with a rebate, was spent on gas.

 I stopped by for some late lunch, so the place only had about 4 other clients in it. I am a friendly person, so I strode in and with a big smile, saying ""Bonjour! Hello!"" The girl behind the counter could barely take her eyes off her phone. I told her that I am allergic to gluten, and asked if the tacos were corn or flour. She responded (still barely looking up from what she was doing) and then I ordered a bowl. I then asked her if it had cilantro in it, to which she asked me if I was allergic to that too, but with a nasty look on her face (I realize I sound ridiculous in this scenario, but how do you write a review about someone's tone without sounding like a spoiled brat?;) I said no, not allergic, but I don't like it and I would rather not have it, so she then begrudgingly went to ask the chef. I was so put off, that I changed my mind right there and left. This part is so obvious, but it's what prompted me to write this review. I've worked in customer service and interaction with the clientele is a huge part of your business. A smile, a nice warm welcome, enthusiastic, or at the least helpful, staff is the bare minimum in my book. I realize she might have been having a bad day, but I had too, my beloved mother had just passed away suddenly 4 days prior. As she would say, (with her delightful British accent) ""Socks up girl!""

 Found what I need at a price much lower than any I could find anywhere else. They worked just fine, and then we swapped them out. Plus, they recycle EVERYTHING - even the boxes the cartridges come in, gotta love that. They have always been quick and courteous. I just bring in the old ones and they do the rest. Perfect for us small business owners! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Whenever I think of Lenny's Burger, I think of that urban myth about ecstasy. You know the one. ""If you have sex on ecstasy, you'll never be able to enjoy it sober."" Why, because the experience is that intense, or because you're brain has been so fried that you can't realize you've spent the last twenty minutes trying to fondle a rock? And why the fuck are you dropping this on me now? Like I'm not stressed out enough worrying about how a ouija board works and whether or not Mountain Dew depletes your sperm count. Shut up, you. Lenny's Burger is the ecstasy of hamburger joints. You go in there not expecting much. Perhaps even a little condescending because you're so fucking spoiled you don't know any better. ""Ha! Look at this ironically low-end establishment! Why, they don't even have a value menu! Bush league! Oh, how cute. They expect you to pump your own condiments. What, couldn't afford the little packets? Ha. This shall be a good laugh."" And then you order, I don't know, for argument's sake, a double-patty chili burger. And fries. And let's just say that, for shits and giggles, you fill your drink cup up with horchata, because it's my fucking scenario. You bring your order back to your table. Ha. How quaint. Burgers served in a noisy steamy cafeteria setting. How retro. One minute you're biting into a slab of meat in between some bread. And the next you're in fucking Willy Wonka land. Your taste buds suddenly become Charlie and Veruca and Augustus. HOLY SHIT THIS BEEF TASTES LIKE IT CAME FROM A REAL ANIMAL! AND THIS CHILI'S FRESH! THE BUN IS TOASTED! JESUS TAPDANCING CHRIST, THESE ARE THE MOST AMAZING FRIES EVER! I'VE NEVER HAD BURGER JOINT FRIES THIS GOOD! AND THIS HORCHATA FUCKING ROCKS! IT TASTES JUST LIKE I IMAGINE HORCHATA WOULD TASTE! And believe me, muchachos, if there were snozberries on that burger, they would taste like snozberries. By the time you've finished your burger, you already crave one again. You spend the next few weeks trying to convince your friends to try it with you. ""Dude, you have to try this burger place. They have the most amazing fuck me burgers ever! Seriously."" ""Nah, man. I'm good."" WHAT!? Bitch, you did not just turn down a suggestion from an Elite! Weeks later, you find that nobody wants to try this place. Because they're all trying to get clean. They're trying to cut back on the fast food. Get on a good diet, go vegan, cut out the refined sugars and carbs or whatever the fuck it is that people with a nutrition book do. It's not you. They're not turning YOU down. They just know. They know because they've seen it happen. One Lenny's Burger and suddenly they're lives will go out of control all over again. One bite of a double-patty country burger with cheese and chili fries and suddenly they'll start double-dipping and eating right before they go to bed, and years from now they'll be wearing those electronic belts that zap the fat off of you while they get their cry on to a very special episode of Maury Povich. It's just you and Lenny's now. You'll do your best to be stoic about it. Eating alone while tables of laughing hipsters and married couples enjoy their hearty meal, stopping to give you the occasional look as they slowly decide in their minds what could possibly be so wrong with you as to force you to eat your meals alone. ""Just come with me once. I'll pay for it."" ""No thanks. I'd rather do McDonald's."" ""WHAT!? Didn't you watch Super Size Me?"" ""Actually, I just did. Now I want a Big Mac."" ""Fine...just this once."" Go on, buddy. Try and enjoy that, what do they call it, a Large N' Delicious? A Royale With Cheese? Yeah, I'm sure you like it going in, let's see how you like it coming back out. Your stomach/intestines aren't fooled. It wants the good shit. It's not going to settle for this ""McBullshit"" you're trying to feed it. Just deal with it. You've been bought and paid for by Lenny's Burger Shop. You are Bitch Numero Uno. Awww, don't cry. Ronald McLittleKid'sNightmare didn't like you anyway. But Lenny's Burger, Lenny's will always love you. It will always be there for you. It will never judge you, and will even forgive this little ""selling out"" phase you went through. It's okay. We all make mistakes. Now...would you like cheese with that? Hopefully today you have learned something, and understand the downward spiral that is consumption of actual food. Be good, stay in school, listen to your parents, and remember, what doesn't give you high blood pressure and diabetes will only make you stronger. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I have been a regular customer at the Phoenix location for many years. My mom introduced my family to this restaurant over 10 years ago I personally have always loved the food and always thought it was the best combination of my two favorite foods. Let me start off by saying this place is so hard to find! I went in the evening an it's located in a business park with only one sign and the front of the restaurant is not well lit so forget about patio dining. With that being said I tried this location since I recently moved to the east valley. I ordered my usual carnitas quesadilla, jade red chicken, chicken fried rice and refried beans. Let just start off to say the beans were canned and none of the food was hot maybe a little warm. I was not impressed with the jade red chicken it didn't taste like what I remember it wasn't even red, it was more like a sad version of pandas orange chicken. The quesadilla had very little cheese and some carnitas which tasted good but was dry from the lack of cheese. Overall the whole meal was a disappointment mostly because I'm so use to the Phoenix location and the quality of food is not the same at all! I will continue to go to the Phoenix location but will never go back the this one. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I went in as I got some coupons in the mail. I added a cheese bread on, and the girl asked her manager for help on applying the coupon. He came out and very rudely advised that the coupon isn't combineable with other offers. Apparently ordering anything else off the regular menu nullifies their coupons. The pizza was okay, but I found the dough to be quite yeasty. I won't be going back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Ice cream + cookies = ice cream sandwich and perfection. Who doesn't love an ice cream sandwich? And with the incredible taste and creaminess of Thrifty ice cream coupled with soft , delicious cookies I don't see how any dessert can be more satisfying! I love that you can choose two of the same or two different cookies, and there are quite a few to choose from. And some of the best Thrifty ice cream flavors are right here! The prices are actually reasonable considering how expensive ice cream can be. The employees are super friendly and helpful and they'll explain the concept to you if you've never been there before. My only complaint is the weird layout of the seating. I had to walk all the way to the back to find that there were no seats. The other store has a much better layout. Can't wait to go back and make more ice cream + cookie creations! ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place has found a way to get slightly worse each time I eat here. The first time I ordered the pork trio and could not get over how incredible everything was. It was a 5 star meal. The second time, I ordered a stuffed veal special, 4 stars. Incredible! This last time, we made reservations. Reservations. In advance. Not walking up, can you please seat us last minute. Reservations. So.... where were we seated? At the first front middle table in the bar. Not the empty dining room, but the bar. As a Platinum M Life player, I get seated in the middle of the bar, front row, with 40 people from what appeared to be a JP Morgan Chase conference practically sitting on our table because apparently it was drink time. The service was incredible slow, because with 40 people in a bar area, it's very hard to pay attention to one of 3 tables. Now, had we been in the dining room that had 4 seated tables, maybe we would have had a better experience. The food was still good, but the experience was lacking. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I went to this place with my girl who wrote the review before mine and I have to agree that this place was AMAZING. I strayed away from my normal deep tissue massage to get a hot stone massage and let me just say it felt so good I left the room feeling a little high and like a came from a different realm. The $85 spent for the hour was well worth it and the male therapist I had was very experienced with what he did. He had worked at many other places I believe he worked somewhere in Mexico as well so he knew how to work those stones. This place definietely beats paying double the price at the spas in the casinos. ",0,0,0,0,1

 So I called this place to get a price on a handgun. The reply I got was; "" four hundred something."" Hmm, I never realized that four hundred something was an actual price. I guess It was to much trouble for the guy to actually look and see what the actual price was. I would have probably got a better answer to my question if I consulted one of those magic 8 balls. Guess what Legendary Guns, I will take my four hundred something dollars and happily spend it at another gun shop. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I used to get my Taiwanese food fix at the Taiwanese fast food place inside the Ranch Market at the Chinese Cultural Center. But it's changed hands, the quality has gone down and it's never had a pleasant area for sitting down to eat. I was happily surprised by Taiwan Food Express when I was at Mekong Plaza a couple of weeks ago. My mouth started watering as soon as I read the menu and even though I just had lunch and I was full, I had to order the pig intestine with mustard greens soup. Was it ever DELICIOUS! Simple and true to taste. I can't wait to try the rest of the items on the menu~ esp. oyster omelette! I'm very happy that it's so close to my son's Chinese school because I have a feeling this is going to be a regular stop for us after class for dinner! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Yelp was raving mad about Viva Las Are???.. so I jumped on the gun when I had the chance and ordered almost everything on the menu for myself and some hungery employees. Honest to say, it was aight.. Meat to dough ratio was a little off.. there was hardly anything inside the empanadas.. and the person that was supposed to take my order just stared at me for a good 10 seconds.. and thats pretty long in staring time! The Garlic Shrimp stood out from the rest in taste and quality but I just wasn't really a fan of the dough. Just a little too.. doughish I guess? I would much rather smother myself with one of 'em cheesy soft tacos at one of 'em spanish carts at one of 'em gasoline stations or one 'em tire repair shops. Now that's a five star.. even with flies buzzn' and all! ...not a totaltarian fan of Viva, but I can't deny that it still hit the spot. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This was exactly what I wanted. A clean place to sleep, in a convenient location with courteous staff. I don't need anything fancy from a hotel, I just want a place to sleep. The only issue I had was that my keycards stopped working, several times. This wasn't a huge problem as the staff was great and always fixed it quickly. But the fact that it happened a few times, and I encountered people in the elevator with the same problem, makes it worth mentioning. But it wouldn't stop me from staying there in the future.

 Ok. The cosmo is considered a trendy, ultra hip resort hotel near the center of the strip. It's a pretty cool property overall, but what really drew me here was the opportunity to stay in a hotel that included a balcony for you to hang out on and just chill. I booked it through a 3rd party travel site and got a sweet weekend deal. You will pay a small premium for the balcony rooms, but let me tell you: They definitely are worth it for the absolute best views in vegas. All the rooms at the Cosmo are suites with a fridge, microwave, minibar, etc. They are tastefully decorated and very spacious. But the feature attraction was the balcony. My room was on the side of the building facing the Bellagio fountains watershow. To be able to walk out on the balcony and see the show from ABOVE the fountains was absolutely awesome!! You can literally see the entire strip all lit up at night, and it is truly a sight to see. They have an awesome Pool party/nightclub called Marquee. If you desire a quieter night's sleep be sure and ask for a room higher up, because the noise from the club can definitely be heard , even from the 39th floor. Not bothersome to me, but others might have a problem with it. Overall the Cosmo is a very nice property, and it's worth at least 1 stay there to experience the terrace suites. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Phoenix has pretty slim pickings when it comes to good pizza, or at least pizza that I'm accustomed to. Rosati's, while not quite what I'm used to, is the best representation of Chicago style pizza that I've found. The Chicago style deep dish is good. The toppings, especially the sausage, are plentiful and tasty and the sauce is good. I think the crust is what is a bit off. Overall, Rosati's is still my choice for pizza in the valley. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Review from the other end of the table, opposite Michele H. from Costa Mesa: Here's the thing about El Patron - it's definitely one of the better Mexican restaurants you'll find in Las Vegas in a town where Mexican food is fairly watered down. Yeah, that band playing a full on concert-length set got pretty annoying after awhile, especially when we started shouting ""WHAT?"" at each other across the table. But in the times I've been to El Patron, the food's always been good, they serve bean dip with the tortilla chips, and the place has a nice family-run, local feel that makes me go back. I'm still a fan. ",0,0,0,1,0

 LOVE this restaurant! It's one of my regular spots now. All the servers I've had so far have all been GREAT!! They have some kind of fish dinner that is to-die-for. Big portions for the price you pay. I usually can't finish all of my fish, but I can't avoid stuffing myself from trying! I also usually get the ""Bunny Toes"" drink. It's like a mint-chocolate White Russian (has Bailey's mint chocolate in it). It's delicious!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Their name makes them sound like a cheesy franchise, but Hummus Xpress is anything but. Home cooked. Delicious. Fresh. Healthy. Great quick service. Couldn't ask for more, except maybe for the falafel to be a bit tastier. I get the chicken plate with rice, broccoli, potatoes, hummus, olives, feta and lentil and kale salad. A meal like that will cost you a little bit more than ten bucks, but is well worth it. Pretty hip atmosphere with chipotle-style food serving. They've got a few talented local musicians who play jazz guitar every once in awhile. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is a good place. Its never crowded so the service is always good. The pizza is excellent as is the pasta but the hamburgers and sandwiches are very average. There is no draft beer which sucks but the bottle beer is reasonably priced especially the imports. They are always out of top shelf liquor for some reason. The happy hours are very odd also. Just an hour in the afternoon and evening and only 50 cents or so off the drinks with no food specials. All in all, not a bad place especially compared to whats in the immediate area. ",0,0,1,0,0

 TERRIBLE! The shower was clogged when we arrived, only to be told there were no more available rooms and an engineer would be up to unclog it. Bathroom was also dirty. How did housekeeping forget to pick up their rags? And yes I know the difference between a towel and a rag. Calls to the front desk were a matter of waiting on hold several minutes. This was also the case when the shower clogged again the next day. Tram service isn't 24 hours, so please don't be fooled. If you go to see a show at any other hotel, and you leave after 1130pm (like most of the world) be prepared to walk 0.9 miles from the Excalibur to Mandalay Bay. Yes I mapped it, my feet don't appreciate walking a mile home each night. Of course you could take a cab, but, why when the tram is advertised as 24hours a day? Also, internet access is $15 a day.

 I went in awhile ago to see what this shop had since I LOVE to bake & am always eager to support my local bakeries. I didnt even get a chance to try the goodies because I was so turned off by the staff. The lady behind the counter seemed like she had an attitude, but hey, maybe I came on an off day. Since I have worked my fair share of customer service jobs I know it can be hard to always be cheerful, but I ended up leaving afterwards. I gave them 3 stars because I would like to come back & actually enjoy the goods. They have great reviews and ill update this when I get a chance to try it again.

 Approaching the doors you'll immediately notice the many stickered awards from restaurant reviewers marking this place as the best Thai food year over year. Walking in the door, the boasting continues with a table, dedicated and decorated for their many Zagat and other food awards. What do you not find? Good service. They certainly missed the mark from the moment I stepped in the door. The host attempted to seat me with another party, sighed with extreme displeasure that I wasn't with the initial group. (I'm sorry; did you just do that in front of your shrine of awards and pictures of the business?) After he came back to me, I was seated with no greeting, no notice of specials for the day, and no smile. :( I ordered the papaya salad to start off with and the red curry lunch special. Sadly, my lunch special came out and was finished by the time my papaya salad came out and I ended up getting the papaya salad to go. As for the food, I'm not sure if this same Archie's Bistro was the same Archie's Bistro that received the numerous awards for their food, but their food was really just average. The red curry sauce was a little too runny and didn't have as much flavor as what I've had at other places. The papaya salad was average. Overall, I'm left somewhat satisfied but still puzzled at how they could have gotten so many awards when my entire experience was lacking from the less than average service and about average food. From the high expectation that was set from their grandiose display of awards I felt disappointed by their horse and pony show. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I cannot believe this national chain gets away with the deplorable conditions that are found in this store. Customers clearly don't care about how they treat the merchandise (and themselves) and employees couldn't give less than a shit, either. I came here last night and the number of people in there with unhappy, tired toddlers (it was 9:30 pm) astounded me. There was an unusually high number of the under-twenty-five-years-old-with-two-or-three-small-children types, too. Checking out was a joke, as we were in the shortest line but behind a family of three that each rang up their purchases as two separate transactions... PER PERSON. But the worst part was in the men's packaged undershirt section. There was an odor in that aisle that was just indescribable. D thought it was a hidden dirty diaper. I disagree, because as a human being, I happen to know what a turd smells like and this was not a turd. It was like a half-rotted corpse extracted from the Scottsdale ""Waterfront"" River. On a side note, I noticed that some other bad reviews include mentions of minorities. Let me just say that there were a lot of unwashed people in this store and they WEREN'T the minorities.

 Horrible service. Food sucked. & made me miss my shopping trip. When we first walked in, there was no one at the host desk so we decided to sit at the bar. We were then greeted by the bartenders & they offered us to sit at a booth on the other side of the bar. Once we had a seat at the table they offered, the table was extremely sticky. You could tell it hasn't been wiped. We ordered the lemon pepper zucchini to start off with while we looked through the menu. They gave us the happy hour menu also, even though it wasn't happy hour. The zucchini came as soon as we were done ordering out entrees. Pretty fast. We ordered the roasted tri tip with a Caesar salad & the stuffed BBQ shrimp that was on the happy hour menu. We waited on our entree for about 30 minutes and it didn't look very appetizing. Also, veggies were more on the colder side. So you cantell it's been sitting at the window for a while. Once our entree was almost done, the BBQ stuffed shrimp finally comes out & it looked like crap. I don't even know why I ate it. I don't know if they were rushing for closing but the presentation on the plate was horrible. And to top everything off.... When we first got there, I asked our server what time the shops closed & he said they closed at 9:30pm on Sundays. Which I thought was weird because that's a super random time. We finished our meal at 8:15pm.. Rushing to make it to the mall. Turns out they close at 8pm on sundays. I went back into the restaurant, yelled across the bar to our server & told him I appreciated the false information he provided and made it pretty clear that I was unhappy with his service.

 Don't get their BIOFINITY contact lenses made by Cooper Vision. I've had 3 pairs so far with different prescriptions even though both of my eyes are at the SAME prescription. It's really hard to read when your eyes are at different prescriptions. The past 2 times the staff have been ok/ cautious about giving me a sample lens to compensate for the busted lens. It's annoying to deal with and I wear my lenses as little as possible to deal with the problem, which defeats the point of buying contact lenses in the first place. ",0,0,1,0,0

 So I just rushed home from Blue because I couldn't wait to get on here and give them this review. Ok, I'm lying. I made one stop on the way home - Barnes and Noble - to buy a dictionary so I could find the words to explain just how bad this place was for me. If not for it being restaurant week, thus having reduced pricing, I might have 'made a scene.' So I'll start with a service review since I can sum it up with one simple fact: 2 hours and 15 minutes into dinner (restaurant week I remind you - simplified menu, 3 courses) we were still waiting on stuff to be brought to the table. The service was atrocious and incredibly slow. At the 2 hour and 15 minute mark, we finally just flagged down the waitress, told her to box up the food, box up the desserts that hadn't arrived yet, just so we could finally get the heck out of there. Initially I thought this was part of the ""Blue experience,"" but its not. The waitress came by every 30 minutes, took the order for the next course, and it took an hour for each course to come out. So the food is boxed and i come home, nightmare over, right? Wrong! they boxed up my friends food and gave it to me, boxed his up an gave it to the 3rd couple that was with us, etc, etc, etc. So NOBODY went home with their own food. I love my friends, but I'm not nibbling at their food scraps. So, food, how was the the food? Not quite horrible, but not quite good either. Edible is a better word for it. I got the ""Grilled Niman Ranch Pork Rack Chop - with a Tuscan white gigante bean and kale ragout finished with a sweet Italian saba."" sounds fancy, eh? Well, it was basically lukewarm vegetable soup, with a hint of chef boyardee, and a dinky pork chop dropped right in the middle. It was so boring and bland, i question the chef's competence and would openly challenge him to a cook-off if this is as good as he could do. I could walk into a grocery store blindfolded, randomly grab something, bring it home and microwave it for 3 minutes, and I would still like my chances. Nobody at the table was impressed with anything they ordered. So let's circle back for a second, and return to service. The waitress was very nice and knowledgeable I have to say. Maybe she was just over capacity? I don't know. But she recognized our frustration and had the manager bring our to-go boxes to us and apologize for the delays and long waits between courses (I think). This is how that conversation went: Manager: ""hey guys, sorry things took a little long, you know uh, restaurant week and the kitchen got backed up. But how was everything?"" Me: ""Well, it was ok. some things were pretty good i suppose, some better than others."" Manager: (blank stare) Me: (awkward moment) Manager; ""well sorry again, and uh i mean, you know ehhhh...."" (blank stare). Me: (still awkward so I'm just going to stand up now and leave). Manager: (blank stare and walks away). needless to say, I will never come back here again. If it were free, I would probably still pass. If asked what could they do to make it right, i would respond with a full refund of the entire dinner, plus compensation for the 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.

 Best Halloween Party in the valley. Get your friends organized and come to this Halloween party. It is awesome. I have gone two years now and am amazed at the creativity and boldness of the costumes. It is a perfect venue. It is really like roaming around in a haunted house. Two live bands and the drink prices were reasonable. Hey, two girls were only wearing body paint! Wow. The view at sunset is just breathtaking. Great place for a really special date. ",0,0,0,0,1

 It appears that the Tap Haus is becoming a larger indoor Hideaway. Took clients there Sunday to watch a game and have some good beer. The bartender should go back to the Hideaway. Two male clients came in and sat next to us when she let loose with several F bombs and gave them the finger several times. Apparently she knew them from the Hideaway however the entire exchange was really inappropriate. Needless to say everyone found it uncomfortable. They just can't seem to get the staffing issue right. Staff turnover is quite high and the majority of staff are always overwhelmed significantly impacting service. The best thing about this place is the beer selection. I'll be sorry to see them go.

 This is one of those hidden gem in the strip. Located in the Stratosphere Towel Hotel and Casino, which is in the north edge of the strip. Getting to this lounge is not easy unless you ask around. The lounge is located at top of the top of the world restaurant, which is in the 108 floor; this lounge is in 109 floor. The first thing you notice of this lounge is the spectacular view of the Las Vegas. The entire city of Las Vegas can be view from all 360"" angle. This floor does not rotated like fancy restaurant below. So the strip and other good view is often been hawk by other customer very quickly. Early Happy Hour Half Price Appetizers: 4pm - 7pm 2-for-1 Cocktails: 4pm - 7pm Late Happy Hour Half Price Appetizers: 10:30pm - 1am 2-for-1 Cocktails: 1am - 4am They got happy hour daily, sadly to say their food is bad in this time type of atmosphere. They said the food comes from the restaurant below, but is hard to believe since the quality is just way off. It could be we got the wrong chef that night, but several review did point that their food were not good. I have not try their cocktail, it should be better than the food quality I assume. We try the Kurobuta Pork Belly, which was super fatty and didn't got the right flavor, it tasted more like left over from lunch. The Waygu Beef Tenderloin Carppacio was also not fresh and disappoint, The Shrimp Cocktail & Lobster Mango Ceviche was not bad but too small portion. The best one was the Cheese Plate. The seat is comfortable but the tablet is very small, this is not idea for big group. However, is perfect for couple, kids do not allow here. Our ID's were check despite we did not even drink. The bathroom sink have a mini television, but the lounge there were none. The real bonus here is that you get to access to the observation desk, I believe this is not the same as those who paid but still provided very nice view. Definite bring you camera when you get here and enjoy. Just aware the food is not great, a least in our experience in their happy hour. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've eaten as this restaurant several times during the past year. The food is usually pretty good, maybe 3 out of 5 stars on average. Today I used a restaurant.com voucher. $25 towards $40 worth of food, however, read on for the unethical practices the owner of this restaurant put in place when attempting to use this voucher... The restaurant.com voucher is a joke. The restaurant automatically includes 18% gratuity on top of the bill. This establishment is strictly counter-service, who is the tip for??? Also, specials are not allowed as part of the voucher redemption and most of what my party wanted was ""considered"" a special. I felt penalized for trying to use the voucher. I will never recommend this establishment for their unethical practices and because they made me feel like a piece of trash. The fact that you have to spend $40 on a $25 voucher is one thing, but to not allow specials and factor in an unethical gratuity of 18% at a restaurant with no servers and strictly counter service shows that this owner has ZERO dignity as a small business owner and he should think twice before trying to lure patrons into an establishment that only allows ""one"" serving of it's special sauce per order! A joke by any standard and when you refuse to cater to your customers, you deserve NOT to be in business. Nothing but a HORRIBLE review for this jerk owner!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Do you remember the mosh pit scene from the Lost Boys...Like that scene, this restaurant is anarchy personified. It is white trash skater/X-games charm at it's finest! You must possess at least 5 tattoos and 3 body piercings to work there. When we arrived, I had to wait nearly 2 minutes because a bunch of ASU kids were engaging in some bean bag game right in the middle of the restaurant. I take that back, you could walked through it but those kids don't wait on anybody...pregnant...too bad....on a walker....you might just trip! Apparently these kids are trying to toss bean bags into some wooden board with holes. Apparently when you are drunk and stoned, games like that are fun! Who knew? The fun doesn't stop there, there is also beer pong. I couldn't distinguish the servers from the patrons because they seem to hang out and chat too. When you ask for their help, it's almost as if they are upset that you interrupted their conversation while they were chatting with the guys playing beer pong. The Patrons...well can we say men in their 40's who looks like they were just released from prison and ASU frat boys (the frat with less money). On weekends, expect to observe a fist fight or two but then again Dos is rather proud of that. Okay so the food...now this is what is disappointing. The food is AMAZING. Seriously, 5 stars. It's fantastic. If this place didn't have the cast of Dazed and Confused settling here, I would go here more often. Even picking up food is a little scary. It's almost as if you receive a dirty look because you are sober. Where to start, the chimichangas and burritos are out of sight! The nachos are huge with quality chicken and plenty of excellent Guacamole. It's a real tragedy because if the owners didn't call themselves the Two Whites guys and had a more ""boring environment"" and invited people who were not drunk or stoned to eat there, this place could actually make Diners Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network instead of Los Taquitos. The food here is certainly better. My advice, get the takeout and order it in the afternoon before the mosh pit starts at night. Wearing a couple of fake tatoos, eye liner and a wife beater might draw less attention too ",0,0,1,0,0

 Love the chipotle hummus, diverse crowd, light rail convenience and fantastic service. Rode the light rail here with a fine gentleman for a date-thing. The patio was a welcome respite from the noise and crowd inside. There were two couples on gaydates who had obviously just met online, and I totally sipped sangria and auditory voyeured on their insights about Facebook, Craigslist and the current state of internet dating.

 As a former regular customer then former employee of this location, honestly this place is horrible. Not the employees who try to be as friendly as possible and help the best they can but the manager, she's rude and only cares about how much money she's making and not her customers. As I said, I am one of her former employees, when I went in for my interview she never asked me why I wanted to work there or if I even had a health card (which I of course did, but she still should have asked) until a month into my employment. After only two days I was appalled at her customer service and couldn't wait until I could find a better job (right next door). Not only does she have no respect for her customers but for her employees, when I worked 8-9 hour shifts she never gave even a 10 minute break to eat, and when I called (because I was out of state at the time and didn't have another choice) to put in my two weeks she said, and I quote ""We will talk about this later. 'Kay bye."" And hung up on me. I really could not wait to leave this place it was dirty and very poorly managed. I refuse to eat there again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Really guys, this is no BS, call K and B garage before you go with any other company. I checked 2 other companies before receiving a referral from a close friend to call K B garage. Coleman arrived at my home right on time as promised. I found Coleman to be very honest, professional, as well as clean cut. In comparison to other previous bids from other companies, I found that K B charges a very honest price for their services. It's really hard to find honest techs in the garage business.

 ""A foot massage joint is like a box of chocolates. You never know who you're going to get."" Luckily for me, Hsing was assigned to me for my appointment. A friend and I walked in and were seated to two lounge chairs in the main room, and she got started on hers right away. Unfortunately for her, her therapist (are they official enough to be called that?) doubled as the receptionist, so every time the door opened, there would be a quick break in her service. I sat for a few minutes while I waited for my person (maybe that is the better term). My friend's person stopped momentarily when a gentleman walked in, looking like he was ready to go golfing at 9:15p - polo, khakis, and all. Turns out, I was looking at Hsing. I suppose you really can't judge a book by its cover though. Hsing seemed to know what areas were aching and he worked out knots all over without me tensing up from pain. The Foot Spa charges $20 for a basic foot massage, and $30 for what they call ""deep tissue,"" which is more of a full body treatment that ends with a focus on the back. Cash is preferred, but plastic is accepted with a $0.50 charge per transaction! ",0,0,0,1,0

 We stayed here for 3 nights while visiting the Las Vegas area. The hotel is typical Springhill Suites decor. The room was ok but when we first arrived the bathtub had a bad leak and was gushing out water. I went down to the lobby and the man at the front desk got someone to come upstairs with me to fix it right away and he did. The room air unit was very loud so we kept it off most of the time we were in the room. Breakfast was ok but Residence Inn breakfasts are typically a lot better so this was not great. Powdered eggs, either turkey sausages or bacon, self-made waffles, toast, yogurt, and coffee. It was definitely ok for the price of $99/night so no complaints. I would probably try another hotel next time just for variety. Oh, and the pool was freezing so I mainly used the spa. Both are small and indoors. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have to say the lure of Oregano's is more the ambiance than the food. On a beautiful evening it's a lot of fun to sit outside with a glass of wine and some good friends and enjoy a meal here. We have friends that come in from Chico every year for the Spring training games and it's kind of a tradition to eat dinner one of the nights at Oregano's. When the toddler was born across the street, my husband walked over that night and got himself some lasagna take-out to come eat with me so now it's also a tradition for us to come here on the toddler's birthday (or thereabouts) to have some dinner and reminisce on that day so that's where we're headed tonight with our brand new three-year-old. It's probably me, but none of their pastas really do it for me - I just don't like them heavily sauced and their pizzas are what my husband likes - cracker thin or oily and thick. There's just no in between. I enjoy their salads a lot and the garlic bread and can eat an order of bruschetta on my own. My husband is also a big fan of the roasted garlic chicken lasagna and it seems we always order a pizza cookie for dessert, though we might get one on the house tonight being the toddler's birthday and all. The waiters and waitresses are always friendly and helpful. In fact once I guess our order was taking too long to come out (we hadn't even realized) and the manager came out and apologized and gave us some drinks and dessert for free. Though obviously not a fancy place at all, it's always proven to be a good place to bring out of town guests. The ambiance, food and service make for a unique experience and won't disappoint.

 An absolute must-visit for myself on St. Denis, Arthur Quentin is an exquisitely sophisticated kitchen store for anyone into high quality food-ware and home chefdom and dining. Note that you can also find perfectly reasonable niche cooking utensils etc. along with the pricier things mentioned by the other reviewer. Divided into three linked rooms, the first room is more of an eclectic melange of fabrics, objects, luggage etc. and also quite lovely. The other two are dedicated to cookware and flatware, tableware, glassware, respectively. Friendly, helpful staff who always wrap everything beautifully for presents or otherwise. Equally lovely to browse at the collection of marvels and spend nothing at all. Note that it's the companion store to Bleu Nuit across the street. Also worth a visit for those into linens, bedding and things of the night. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Rusty's is the kind of diner/hole in the wall joint that always serves consistency. The menu isn't ground breaking. They're not going for a Michelin Star here and the goal is to serve good, consistent food day in and day out. Rusty's is quaint and humble from the outside. (Beware of the construction happening in Quail Corners) Just a few tables with umbrellas, a small neon sign and a basic white spelling of ""Rusty's"" above the building. The interior is great. Almost like a flashback from the 90's. Business cards all over the wall to your left, cooler of drinks, large menu next to the ordering window, tons of copies of National Geographic in the dining area....Just a great little joint. The menu is pretty standard deli style. Sandwiches, soups, potatoes, salads. My wife and I usually go for a double-decker pb&j but sometimes we venture out of our mainstay. The potatoes are rather large with a gratuitous amount of toppings. Not my favorite, but worth a try if you're hungrier than usual. I love their Reuben. Not a huge NY style stack of pastrami. Just a medium-sized 'wich with sauerkraut and Thousand Island. Simple and familiar. I love Rusty's. A great local, hole in the wall that serves the same dependable food day in and day out.

 SOOOO DISAPPOINTED TODAY!!! What a disappointment today when we had lunch at Gertrude's. The restaurant only had people at 3 other tables and we couldn't get anyone to take our order. All I can say is : PLEASE BRING BACK YOUR OLD MENU! We have been going to this place since they opened and had previously loved everything about it. The 'offerings' are fewer and not so appetizing. Truly expensive for what we received. Very strange ingredients paired together. My husbands Tuna Sandwich left much to be desired...a pile of tuna with 2 olives on it...the toast it was served on was like a large piece of rubber. My Hummus wrap had so many grains/seeds in it I thought it was bird food to say the least. The edges of my spinach wrap was hardened all the way around.

 Walmart is, and has always been a disgusting store to shop in. It is listed at the top in my personal book of ""Places to Never Return"". I would rather pay the extra 10 bucks to not have to be around the crack heads and obese smelly people that shop there. Call me a snob, I really don't care. That being said, I decided to try my luck with the online Site to Store ordering. I figured how bad can it be..? All I have to do is walk in and pick up the item. No shopping, no standing in line to pay.. Sounds painless right... I walk in and have no idea where the Site to Store pick- up area is. I try to ask the greeter, but he is busy picking his nose and arguing with a homeless guy. I go to the Customer Service Center line and stand there for 27 minutes. I actually saw 2 people go on break while there were about 10 of us waiting in line. When it is finally my turn some snooky clone tells me it is in the back of the store through the pet section. Sure that makes sense, much more sense than just putting a sign up directing me where to go. I get back there and wait another 30 minutes for the guy to get my order and bring it up. By this time I have to use the bathroom (I've been in the store over an hour). I walk back to the front of the store and the bathroom is closed. Someone took a diaper and wrote their name on the wall with the poo. No I am not kidding, it is really that disgusting. I got home and the patio set I bought was missing several parts. I went to a hardware store and bought them. I'm never going to Walmart again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We stayed in Tower 3 and requested the highest floor available, in our case it was the 37th floor. Our room was a One-Bedroom Suite with balcony plus strip view. The entire hotel -- from the gated entrance to the room itself -- seemed spotless and had a 'clean' smell. The room had a full kitchen w/full-size refrigerator), a wetbar with two barstool-type chairs, a dining table w/4 chairs, one large sofa w/pull-out queen bed, the balcony, the separate bedroom and master bathroom w/jacuzzi, and, of course, a SECOND FULL bathroom. The higher floor rooms with balcony offer some pretty amazing views. It was nice to get some fresh air anytime we liked instead of having to go downstairs and step outside without a view. Although not very big (maybe as big as a queen-size bed), the night-time views coupled with the extra wind from being higher up was alone worth the higher cost of the room. I only had 2 minor complaints: the walk from Tower 3 to the strip and the slightly cramped and older looking furnishing/layout. Now, I know the walk from Tower 3 to the strip isn't THAT bad, but it was my first time staying at a hotel that didn't have a casino or club that was just an elevator's ride away. I knew this coming in so I didn't deduct any stars from the rating. As far as furnishing and layout I will say it didn't feel like 950sq ft. The way the living room was setup it didn't give off an open feeling, but rather a narrow and cramped feeling instead. I think the wooden entertainment center was on the big side (taking away some space from the living area) and the cheap looking dining table was slightly small, yet kept 4 average-sized chairs. I can best compare their size to those outdoor tables and chairs you see at your local Starbucks. To me it looked as if it was an afterthought, like they realized they can squeeze a table with chairs in that empty space. Furthermore, across the sofa we see a small, glass table which I really felt like taking out of the room because it was a) older looking and b) almost near the middle path which one walked to get to the balcony. I am aware I am DEFINITELY nitpicking, but they were feelings I had during my stay and I feel it's important to share them because some of you may like a more open-type living are with more modern furnishing. These are not issues that would keep me from coming back again so there's no need to remove stars! The positives absolutely outweighed the cons. The 2 FULL bathrooms saved us a ton of time when it came to get ready. We had one guy in our party who literally takes an hour to shower, shave, etc.., so having that second bathroom allowed us to get ready without having to wait for that guy. Another lifesaver was the full kitchen. We brought lots of snacks and things we can heat up if we wanted a snack and this kitchen was loaded with appliances and pots and pans. The fridge had plenty of space for about 30+ beers and several bottles of alcohol (plenty for a 4 night stay). Finally, I would like to say that you get quite a bit for your money's worth at the Signature if you are okay with a little walk and if you don't have to absolutely have the most modern furnishing. I will be staying here again in the summer of 14' and I cannot wait to return! ",0,0,0,0,1
