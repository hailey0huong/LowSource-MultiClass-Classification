 OVERPRICED!!!! I had 4 dresses from white house black market dry cleaned and they charged me $20/dress. The price on their website listed dresses as $10.75, but what they failed to mention is that they were probably talking about kid cotton dresses. It took a week to get the dresses back. For the quality and time, it is definitely not worth the price. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Yeah I agree with Amy G and Emma C before me - this particular Debenhams really isn't the best showcase, but Debenhams is ace - lets not lie! It's the sort of place you can spend the whole day in. They have everything you could possibly want, tights, shoes, dresses....and that's just the menswear. Yeah, this branch is grotty and I'm often left feeling a bit dirty when I leave, but call it my guilty pleasure. You really can't fault the quality, the price and the staff. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We decided to go to George's for Charlotte Restaurant week and we were severely disappointed. The wait staff was exceptional...attentive without being intrusive and very helpful. Unfortunately, the food was less than inspiring. I'm vegan, so my boyfriend asked the waiter if he could have the chef cook something creative. He came back and said that because it was restaurant week, the chef really couldn't do much since they were so busy. We arrived at 6:30 and there were only 5 other tables seated at the time. Not too busy. The waiter came back and said that the chef could cook up some noodles in olive oil with some spring vegetables. Sounded good. What I got was a bowl of cool pappardelle noodles, no oil and partially steamed squash, asparagus and brussel sprouts. They were unevenly cooked, seperate, cool to the touch and devoid of olive oil, salt or pepper. For a restaurant with such a great reputation, they could have come up with something more impressive than that. My brother had the short ribs - per my boyfriend's recommendation. (He had heard that they were outstanding). They were dry, small, no braised gravy and they too were cool in temp. He commented that it was like leftover pot roast. My boyfriend's meal was the ratatouille and it too was cool, lumpy and the noodles were stuck together. I'm giving George's two stars because it was restaurant week. Had it not been, I would have given George's only one star. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Tucked into the corner of this plaza next to a yoga place, a variety of fun flavors and good toppings make me a fan of this place. I can't get enough of the create-your-own-froyo-sundae places. Any place that offers peanut butter fro-yo can't possibly be bad in my book. They also offer such flavors as cake batter, coffee, Irish mint, dulce de leche, and even honeydew freeze (and many, many more). They rotate out some flavors every week. They also have a big topping station, with multiple candy bar toppings, syrups (including marshmallow flavor), cereal, cookie dough, boba, and nuts (and still more). Prices are pretty reasonable at $.42 an ounce. The inside is cute and colorful, with a decent amount of indoor and outdoor seating. Staff was friendly and helpful. Parking close by can get a little annoying on weekends, but they have plenty of parking in the next lot over near Harris Teeter. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Hash brown breakfast burrito with ham, sausage, bacon, eggs, cheese and enough cholesterol to have cardio issues before you finish. The food is good. Armandos now has a Filiberto sign. I'm not sure if they bought or merged. Just tell me the recipe for the red hot sauce. Anyone, who has the recipe? ",0,0,1,0,0

 Buffalo Exchange aims to be a cool thrift store with only stuff people would actually want to buy. Although they succeeded, the prices aren't really at all close to thrift store prices. They have some unique things but I wouldn't go in there expecting to get a great deal. If you are feeling thrifty stick to Savers or Goodwill, and treat Buffalo Exchange as a regular shopping experience. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Love this little town. The Chapel is open to the public. Great place to take guests then a trip to the lake after. There are not too many people so not as touristy as some of the other ghost towns. Views of the Superstition and Goldfield mountains are awesome. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I wish Yelp offered half stars. After trying many acclaimed restaurants featured on the food network, I've come up with a conclusion. The food at many of these restaurants kinda sucks. They don't want to offend the restaurant, so they give good praise. In reality, the food isn't that great. It seems they are only featured because they are a staple in that community, unique or has some type of significant history. I respect that though. I like BBQ king for being all of those things, but the food is mediocre. BBQ was not smoky at all. No flavor. I don't think it's even really smoked. I am no connoisseur, but I know this isn't good Q. Regular fried chicken is good. The fried chicken dipped in BBQ is nice. Something new, not my cup of tea, but if I grew up on it, I surely would understand. Service and Cheeseburgers are good though. And most importantly, very affordable. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Had my Taco' in for service five times since I owned it: 1. First day owning it I was getting an engine warning I found I had no gas cap - they gave me a new one, but forgetting to include a gas cap? 2. First week owning I had a tire air pressure warning - took them four visits to fix the leak over a two week period 3. Oil change with an appointment - took 2 hours while I sat and waited 4. Oil change dropped it off - when I returned it took them a half an hour to find my truck, and they forgot to wash it as offered 5. Oil change dropped it off - had to wait over a half hour for the 'valet' to get my truck. Oh yeah, they forgot to wash as offered again. They asked if I wanted to wait while they 'washed it up'. I think not. Service here is awful in my experience. The only reason I gave them a two star is the oil changes are free. ",0,1,0,0,0
