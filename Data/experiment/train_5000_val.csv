 Hadn't had any cavities in a long time... All of a sudden had 10??? Since 7 were on one side but multiple surfaces of teeth equal the 7 (not 7 teeth), decided to do one side at a time. Had horrible sensitivity and pain. Decided to go elsewhere for 2nd opinion. Gave them my last digital X-rays and they took new ones. Said NO cavities... So where are those last 3 that were on the other side???? Beware! Never going back there. Ask their front office staff how long they've been there... They keep getting new people, wonder why.

 Place was very convenient for us since we were staying in Cosmopolitan, but that's about the only good thing I can say about this place. The service was decent, but not what I would expect from a high end restaurant at all. We had the Sushi platter (about 10 piece i think), Sashimi platter (around 10 piece) , Beef Fried rice, and fried oysters. About $200 with couple of beers. The quality and freshness of the fish was on par with my local places (san ramon, ca) at about a fifth of the price. I had some good fish in San Francisco in a similar price range, and this place does not hold candle to it at all. Perhaps I didn't drink enough to dull my taste buds... ",0,1,0,0,0

 Hope you like meat, because that's really what it's all about here! Leave your little coaster on green light, and let the feast begin! Waiters bring out skewers of different choices of meat from sirloin, flank steak, bacon wrapped chicken, pork ribs, filet mignon, and parmesan crusted pork. Yes, there is a salad bar, of which i felt like I had to balance out my meal, but not the highlight. All of the staff bringing out the skewers was overwhelming at first. I was like can I finish chewing first before you bring out more???? But who was I to say no to more succulent cuts of beef, and ribs, and more beef! My only ""beef"" hahaha, was that once the staff saw that our party of 12 was slowly putting out their red stop signs, they pretty much stopped entirely while there were a few of us carnivores that were still chowing down. We had to ask for the filet mignon and the parmesean crusted pork, and even then they brought out one piece of the pork. C'mon mannnnn! Gimmee mo' meat! The staff handled our large group well, and even brought out a complimentary order of flan for the guest of honor, which was better than I was expecting since I'm not a big fan of flan. I will be on the look out for more of Fogo de Chao and other Brazilian steakhouses when I'm on a meat binge. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I remember when this place first opened. I was very excited since it seemed so ""humbling"". I came here for lunch and thought this place actually looks ""okay"" at best. Chicken Sandwich was excellent. The bread was toasty and crunchy, while the Chicken and toppings were warm and buttery! However, the soup can improve. They only gave to you 2 options so I guess I had a 50/50 chance of getting the good one! The place was loud and popping! Not sure what to make of it since they had wine racks and wine, but then teeny hot pink tank tops hanging from the wines. Is this supposed to make me want to drink more wine or should I buy a shirt for my GF? Though I don't think anyone would appreciate a shirt that says PIE. Service was good, I guess. Our waiter was very nice and helpful, but he seemed flustered with a smile. He didn't do anything wrong by any means except he was going about 100 more miles than I was. - Enjoy ",0,0,1,0,0

 Just changed my original review from 5 months ago.... Made it when Jose Luis & Catherine owned it... 5 to 2 stars... Food still good...I guess I would say decent... Some stuff on menu has changed for better and worst... Weird oil n vinegar (wtf!) never seen powdered oil & jelled balsamic ( bizarre & sucked!) atmosphere is nice but is super creepy with the band ( or actually lounge act) & new owner that is there now... Only perk is that the old barkeep Kevin still remains... But for how long? Over priced for the staff they have now ( except Kevin) bottom line is I miss the old elements & won't b back .... Love u Kevin but new owner freaks me n' my girls out!!!!!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 My wife and I have been going here for as long as we have lived in Pittsburgh, which is about 10 years. This is our go-to Chinese restaurant, even after we moved out of the neighborhood. I have never had a bad meal here, and I will forever love their beef chow fun! My wife and I are moving to North Carolina in two days, and Tasty Chinese was the thing about Pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most. These are great folks, and I wish them the best of success in the future. Remember, everyone, just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad! Some people just have lousy taste buds, and many people have no idea what they are ordering to begin with. Try things for yourself, and you will find some great food at Tasty! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I used to LOVE this outlet store. I have spent hundreds of dollars during my previous trips to Las Vegas here. But now they have very little have discontinued Disneyland park merchandise in the store. They said they may get some again around the holidays. So sad, I told a bunch of people I would bring them back a shirt from Disneyland and then.... poof... no adult sized shirts at the outlet! UGH!!!

 In the most bizarre strip mall along crack alley is where you will find Harrie. I get to drive through here everyday on my way to work, so I've become familiar with Harrie over the years. I boycotted for about 7 years but recently started coming back because I was sick of Einstein's. I love an everything bagel, and what I love even more is when ""everything"" is on both sides of my bagel. I found that here. Problem is, their bagels are really hard. Really, really hard. My usual spread is onion & chive. I find their spreads here are really thin, if you were to hold the bagel to on the side, it would slide off. I tried the Lox spread and it was so incredibly salty, I ended up throwing it away. What I do love is the cookie case. I've tried them all, and they are all pretty damn good. Also I think their prices are a little steep, $3.78 for a bagel & cream cheese (did I really just complain about prices for a Jewish deli)? Yes, I did. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Naturally, the first thing I do when trying out a new place is check out the reviews on Yelp and when I checked it out for Akahana, many people mentioned how bad the service was. I wanted to be the one who proved them wrong, the one to show everyone that Akahana would be my new, wonderful go to spot with terrific service but I'm sad to report I'm not that person. I don't know if it was because they are newer and are drawing in quite a crowd on Thursday nights and the servers are overwhelmed but the service was almost non existent. We practically had to flag down our waitress to give her our order, get refills, etc. and I contemplated throwing a chopstick at our server to get her attention but with my luck, that would've either a) turn into a lawsuit or b) get violently ill from sushi gone wrong. On the flip side, $17 for two rolls, a salad and a beer is A-Ok in my book. The sushi? Holy wonderful, fresh, yummyness batman! I was surprised by how fresh it was and how much flavor it had packed in the rolls. Some mentioned that the rolls on BOGO nights (Tuesdays and Thursdays) were smaller but I felt they were appropriate sized pieces for what they are charging (I can't remember the names exactly but got the Furious Dragon and Sweet Romeo roll). The downside about BOGO nights is that there isn't any vegetarian options on the BOGO menu and it says no substitutions on the menu. The vibe was good-very vibrant with orange walls, moderate volume music and packed. They have a moderate sized bar area complete with the regular stuff you would expect-ESPN, Japanese beers and specials galore. I will be back to check out Akahana.....but only when I have nothing planned afterwards so I won't mind waiting so long for my sush. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have been going to this big o tires for the past 4 years and have probably spent about $2,000 + on tires and services. They were great about getting me tires and all but the second I come back to get a tire replaced on warranty because the tread was separating from the tire, they pull out the fine print of my warranty (it was the tiniest print you've ever seen) and asked for my service records for every 5,000 miles since I bought the tire. It had been about 20,000 miles so I would have needed to produce at least 4 records of service. I'm sure this is company policy and they are following protocol but seriously, 20,000 miles and the tread is separating and you won't honor the warranty on an obviously defective tire? We'll here I am telling my story and will never go back to that store or any other big o tire ever again. I'll make sure all my friends know about this as well. A little customer service would have gone a long way here but they blew it. Walmart came to the rescue and I got a new tire for 1/2 the price the ""offered"" to replace the bad tire for. Yup, never again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I liked the decor in here, and the staff were fast, but the prices and crowds do let it down a bit. Admittedly a crowd is usually a sign of something desirable, so I won't use this against the place. It was just kind of annoying as my friends and I couldn't hear ourselves speak, and we didn't think we were going to a club. We also waited for ages to be served, and it wasn't even the weekend! The expertise in cocktail making really are this place shines. That and the high ceilings and elegant design. Dragonfly does lose a point for the prices... However good the cocktails are, I can't justify paying \ u00a37 for a martini.... Nor \ u00a34 for the cheapest pint on menu. At the end of the day, this is still just a place where people get hammered, and I didn't see much in the way of moderate drinking for the pleasure of it here. I would return if I saw fewer crowds and lower prices... ",0,0,1,0,0

 I REALLY ENJOYED THIS HOTEL!!! First off it wasn't too far from downtown, and you can easily catch a cab downtown for not too much $$. It feels like there is nothing around the place but there is, you just have to do some exploring. The staff here was so awesome and friendly, they were very helpful to tell us everything to do around town, what times, have an amazing map and list of places, were just really all about getting us the ALL we needed and wanted to know. The bar inside the hotel was really nice, TV's were nice because sports were on and the bartender was very cool, and experimented with any kind of drinks we could make up he would try to make them and had some tasty concoctions of his own! We really had a great time at that bar, almost too good of a time to actually leave and head downtown for the night, but it ranked higher than a lot of the places we went. I needed a good workout, couldn't ask for a better facility, had an indoor pool too and it was really nice. The equipment was all new and there was plenty of it, I really enjoyed the gym there and visited it a couple times!!! If you're ever in the area, need a nice place to stay, very affordable, great amenities and friendly as can be staff, this is the place your looking for! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Came here thinking there is a 25% chance that I'd be disappointed because of all the hype and being from Oakland where there is so much bomb ass cheap Thai food. Nope, 99% satisfied. The 1% is portions are on the smaller side, especially given how expensive each dish was. On to food: Crispy duck panang- no joke, this is absolutely ridiculously delicious! It isn't spicy and is a type of red curry. Drizzle on rice and take a bite of the duck=heaven. Crispy rice (nam kao tod)- so so so so so good. Order your own, so good you don't want to share. Perfect amount of spice and leaves a good citrus tang at the end of each bite Drunken noodle with beef- I originally wanted the one with soft shell crab but they didn't have any on the night I went :( The beef is pretty standard and so were the noodles. Not that it was bad but since everything else was amazing, this is pretty standard Tiger prawn wrapped in bacon and wonton wrappers- pretty average. I mean it's good cuz its a tiger prawn wrapped in bacon and wonton but nothing unique. I'd suggest saving space for the other better things. Thai tea- hard to mess this one up overall but pretty damn good. The tea they used is brewed pretty strong and I can tell cuz it leaves the bitter tea after taste but that's how I like it Tip: Make a reservation! Guaranteed during prime dinner time you'll wait 45-60min. I called for reso a month ago and the convo went like this, ""I'd like to make reservations. We are all booked tonight! It's actually for next month. Ok, your name and number. And don't be more than 5 min late or we give away your table!"" This should show you that they are so popular that they DO NOT NEED YOU. Along with that, when I arrived, this is what happened, I walked in and said hi, immediate response was, it is an hour wait! ok but I have reservations....oh ok, wait here. Then I was seated in 5 min. Lesson of the story, make a reso! The line may be busy, keep trying and trying again, it's worth it! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Ahh BJ's... 6 months ago you were one of my favorites in the East Valley. Now, not so much. In fact, I may never go back. Always enjoyed the atmosphere which has not changed, usually the wait staff is competant, but the food was always great. Good portions and quality ingredients, but not anymore. Server was very mechanical and short. Since others bring the food, what else dies she have to do except check on us and keep our drinks filled? Sad. We ordered the Italian Market Salad which we usually split. It used to be a very finely chopped mountain of lettuce with great veggies, Garbanzo beans, cheese, meat etc. Now it has a small handful of white, droopy iceberg lettuce, tons of dressing and lots of white cheese balls. I could not finish my half (I was starving buy it was too gross) so we quickly paid and left. At this point even Taco Bell or Chipotle sounded good! So sad.. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Dirty. All bathrooms are GROSS, the cement throughout the park needs to be pressure washed, long lines for food & for drink refills (& there's never been a manager around helping), all lifeguards have different rules/leniences and seem inexperienced with efficiency of riders causing long wait times. I'm surprised that the place isn't covered in pennies as everything ends in .99, annoying. No I don't want .01 back every time I purchase something, I'm in a bikini! Last but definitely not least, I'm a Gold Pass Member & purchased the reusable cup. After leaving the park on my 1st visit, we went out to eat. Upon returning to my car, my cup had MELTED. What is this cup made of? Then the park refused to replace it, their statement is ""once you purchase the cup, it's your property"". Duh, and it's defective property & I want a new one! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I love this place. I went there for the second time on my last trip to Vegas, and while my love affair for the Sahara has come to an end, my love for the House of Lords is just beggining. OK, first off, T-bone steak, mashed potatoes, green beans, a friggin' schooner of really nice cabernet (their wine glasses are huge and they poor big), and a heavenly desert involving chocolate and peanut butter.... $67 and that's WITH a 20% tip. There simply is no room for complaint in that. OK, so some of the other reviewers didn't care for the wait staff. I'll tell you what... this place is in the friggin' Sahara man. Most of those waiters have been there for 20+ years and they know that the Sahara is aching for a wrecking ball. You go in there with an attitude and I could totally see the dining experience head south quick. If, on the other hand, you are pleasant and gregarious like I am, I can damn near guarantee you will have a wonderful experience and a piece of meat that would normally cost you $80-90 a head or more. My waiter was a cool guy who had been there 20 years. Since the place was slow (it was Wednesday night) and I was alone at a convention he took the time to chat for a while. Little friendliness on my part scored great service and a free ""topping off"" of the old wine glass. I reccomend this place whole heartedly. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Do not waste your money on this place... Bad experience ... I went to get my tires balanced and rotated and they couldn't get that right.... How hard is that??

 This has to be one of the worst run businesses I have ever seen. Due only to proximity to my home, I have attempted to accomplish a few seemingly simple post office errands on multiple occasions, and the incompetency of ALL staff and services provided never ceases to prevail. **Passport Photo and application for our 3 month old baby- Attendant says ""We need you to make copies of these documents and come back before we can complete photo and application... But we have no copy machine. Make copy and come back"" (I then leave with baby to make copies elsewhere and return, wait in line again only to hear)- ""Let me see if someone can do the photo..."" (Lady asks staff loudly)- ""Who can do the passport photo?"" (Silence from staff. She struggles to get an answer out of one staff member who says)- "" we don't have the white sheet"" (even though there is blank white wall in the photo area to utilize and I am perfectly capable of holding up my baby for it go the face shot where my arms won't show). She finally says ""just go to walgreens and get a photo and come back"". Needless to say I didn't return to complete the process at this location. **Example 2: Mailing a package and letter using Priority Service- as I look around for mailing labels and packages, they are of course out of priority labels and every type of package other than the largest size. I settle for using my own envelope which I was hoping to deliver in pristine condition and go to the self service area to print a paid mailing label which I can them write an address on. Looking around for a pen, which of course there are none (even for sale), The staff points to a pen refill with no case on it, that was placed in one of 6 different empty pen holders. I grab the tiny refill and try to write on the label, and the leaky refill gets ink all over my hand. I ask for a paper towel or tissue and of course no one knows anything about where to find one. One staff member tells me to ask the mail room person, but that person is of course not around at the moment. This all may sound like a comedy act but I'm sorry to say that it's the actual experience you are likely to receive at this post office location.

 The college of frozen desserts Some people cannot tell the difference between gelato and ice cream. Their loss. Although ice cream has more butterfat and more sugar than gelato, gelato has more flavor. The fruit or chocolate flavors are not muted by the butterfat. This lesson was well learned on our trip to Sweet Chill. As a former college student that spent years trying to pay off college debt, I know that any education can come with quite a large price tag. I expected a dessert-lunch (yes, I was having gelato for lunch) at Aria to cost as much as my college education. Afterall I was about to learn something. To start, I learned that pistachio ice cream (er... gelato) isn't my cup of tea. Neither is Nutella. Total cost for these lessons, zero. If you are questionable about a flavor, just ask - they'll happily give you a small spoonfull. I also learned that a small is like $4.75 while a large is $7 and change for 3 times more of the Italian confection. Since I was there with my wife, we went with the large 3 scoops (Strawberry, Chocolate, and Blueberry Cheesecake) and saved a few bucks. I also learned that gelato is denser than ice cream. Ice cream is about 50% air, making it easy to scoop (if you've ever melted then re-froze ice cream, you know the stuff is rock hard without the air). Gelato on the other hand is only about 25% air. It's freezing point is kept in check with less fat and a scientifically-balanced amount of sugar to maintain it's softness. This results in 50% more edible dessert. If you eat with your eyes, you may feel that $7.57 (after tax) for 12-16 ounces is pricey, but you stomach will be filled as if you just ate 18-24 ounces of ice cream. A fine lesson indeed. Finally, I learned that Aria (in the City Center) must truly be an expensive place, because even though I was sitting in a kid-friendly location (essecentially an ice cream parlor) I didn't see signs of a single kid. Tables wern't sticky, floors were clean, chairs were spotless. But the decor was all hard plastic, so maybe after a group of kids come through, they just close the doors and hose the whole place down with a high pressure firehose. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Part of my Vegas routine is to head to this little strip mall on the corner of Tropicana and Decatur, grab a coffee at Starbucks, work out at the 24 Hour Fitness (I'm not about to pay $20 to use my strip hotel's ""spa""!), and then go to Sushi 21 for a post-workout meal. While this isn't the best sushi around, it is still of good quality and reasonably priced, and I've yet to have a disappointing meal. I normally get either the chirashi sushi or its Korean equivalent, hye dup bap (I believe this place is Korean owned and operated), each of which is a great deal for around $12 (though they charge an extra $2.50 for miso soup, which typically comes with chirashi at most places).

 If I could put 0 stars, I would. I'm pissed: 1. The wait was ridiculous. Which is understandable because its LasVegas, but it shouldn't take an 1hr 20mins to get some damn fondue 2. Most of the dessert menu items are inaccurate. None of the Ice cream waffles had icecream unless you add 1 scoop of icecream for $3 a scoop. But all of the pictures of the waffles had icecream on them. So the menus needed to be updated. 3.The Vanilla Bread and Red Velvet cake that came with Fondue were old and dry. 4. When we got the check, we were charged twice for 1 scoop of icecream on the ice cream waffles. After explaining the situation to the manager, he made up a reason for the double charge but eventually took it off. But that's it. 5. The server was rude, and after talking to the manager about the waffle debacle, she became offended and threw the bill at us. (When we were gonna give her a tip because her service wasn't that bad) Overall, I'm never coming here again. Worst experience for a dessert-type restaurant. The only reason why this place gets attraction is because many celebrities have been there. But this is Vegas... celebrities have been everywhere, it's nothing special. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Meh. I had to ask for water twice. The second time was when my meal came, and I was still left drinkless. I waited and waited some more, staring at my plate, and finally was given not one, but two glasses of water; as if two late should make up for one on time. My Ruben was terribly dry. I drenched it with a full mini bottle of dijon, but even that didn't help much. A pickle would have been nice too. For $15, I'd hope to get something that was at least half way decent. I must say I was a bit disappointed, even for cafe standards.

 Quite possibly my favorite place in the entire United States. It's unfortunate it has to be in Pittsburgh, PA...but that's part of what makes it awesome in it's own way. I am giving this place the honor of my very first Yelp review even though I have not lived in Pittsburgh for more than a year. This place has amazing American pub food. The nachos are piled high with an indeterminable amount of good toppings. The buffalo wings (and other kinds of wings) are large, properly covered in sauce, and perfectly spicy. But the best food here are the pizzas. The Flying Buffalo, the Garden of Eden, et. al. No matter what mood you are in, there's an awesome personal pizza to be had. As if the food wasn't enough, they have probably the best (not the largest - the best) beer selection in Pittsburgh. House brews and Great Lakes (from Cleveland), Guinness, Yeungling, all on tap. More than 50 others in bottles. At decent prices too! Almost all food is half-off after 11PM every night - which is key. On Saturdays, the ""house blues man"" Don Sjzeck, plays his awesome mix of Johnny Cash, Greatful Dead, blues, and rock covers as well as his fun sing-along original stuff. It made every Saturday night awesome for me. Hangover Breakfast on Sunday mornings is great for its stated purpose. Unlimited coffee, bloody marys, etc. Do what you need to do and go there one night.

 Voluto serves Commonplace Coffee, which is, hands down, the best coffee in Pittsburgh. Voluto is a great space with lots of light and super comfy chairs. I love their high-tech ipad checkout system. I was, however, a little disappointed with the service and my drink. My friend and I ordered a latte and a capuccino, and when they came out on the counter we weren't informed which was which (we figured it out without asking, but still). And, sadly, my latte was lukewarm. I was disappointed, but will try again next time I'm on Penn Ave. ",0,0,1,0,0

 What better place for a haven of vinyl than Plaza Midwood? Pardon, not just vinyl, but a great selection of new, old, classic, and unknowns that have been newly refound, used and delivered anew to this glorious establishment. I used to be a big CD buyer and this place has always been a treasure trove for what I was/am in the market for and wasn't in the market for.I love that you can always find something you didn't know you wanted until you saw it here. So many of my favorite bands tend to release vinyl editions of past records and I love that I can find them here. They always have box sets, too, which can be hard to find elsewhere, other than the internet. I've come in on a weekday and just perused for hours and had conversations with the owner about shows, new records, turntables and other things. He's a cool dude. They've been known to have some shows here, too. Usually something local, but still fun. It's a squirrely little shop with no real allocated parking lot. Take heed to some of the spots in the surrounding shopping areas as you may come back to your vehicle with with a nice, shiny boot on one of the front wheels. ",0,0,0,0,1

 What can I say, Great food and great Margarita's...The atmosphere is fun, and lively - the wait staff is excellent (not a bunch of summer kids filling time) but a professional staff. The bar is medium size and elegant looking - and they have 5 nice tall large round table in the bar so you can dine there as well. The main restaurant area is just as elegant as the bar area. We usually sit and eat in the bar areas of most restaurants. The food is always good and the kitchens fast on getting food out. If you like Guacamole, this is the place to get it - they make it fresh right at your table.. and the chips are always crisp. If you are looking for the Typical ""chain Mexican food type restaurant"", then this is not the place to go. The food is Mexican, but with style and flair... Different but great. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I really enjoyed our meal here! It's expensive but worth it. This place gets a 4.5/5. We wanted to try a fine dining experience and I am glad that we chose this restaurant. We ordered a few things to share. What was really thoughtful and a great idea was that the kitchen prepared everything as separate portions so that we didn't need to divide the dishes ourselves. Service 5/5 Service was excellent! There was a lot of staff, but they all had a purpose. There was one person just refilling everyone's water, another clearing table, and folding napkins. I did sometimes seem to get real busy with so many staff. The sommelier came over to the table to ask what we were eating and recommend a wine. This was another great touch! The manager was also walking around making sure that everyone was enjoying themselves. The atmosphere had a good vibe to it. We came here on a Wednesday night and the place was very busy. Everyone around us seemed to be having a great time. Food 4.5/5 Our waiter was friendly, and we got a brief tutorial on the different cuts and types of steak the restaurant serves. Having the steak cut examples as a visual, really helped. This is one of the few restaurants I've been to that does this. We got some free bread to start off the meal, which was great. For appetizers ordered the Hamachi Crudo. This was delicious light and delicate, the garlic puree was not overpowering. The Hamachi was soft and melted in your mouth. My boyfriend who usually dislikes garlic loved this dish. We also had to potato and octopus salad. The dish was nicely balanced and I really enjoyed the potatoes and vinaigrette. The appetizers were delicious. For mains we ordered the American Rib Cap. The steak was well cooked, and tender, and the marbling on the beef gave it a fatty richness to the steak; however I thought it was way too salty for me. This was the only dish that I didn't enjoy as much. We got the beef wellington and it was yummy and AMAZING! The pastry was light and crispy, and the steak was tender and juicy. The vegetables and the potato puree were tasty. They helped cut the richness of the wellington, worked well with the meat. I loved the red wine demi-glace. I can see why this dish is Gordon's signature dish, it was lovely. They served both mains at the same time, which was great however by the time we finished the beef wellington the rib cap had gotten a bit cold. Sadly I was too full to try any of the desserts. Overall we had lovely experience here. We had a couple of disappointing meals before this and I am glad this lived up to expectations. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Breakfast is $20, but some nice lady clued us in on saving $5 if you sign up on the Stratosphere's Ace Play card at the Player's counter. That's what we did. 10 min later, saved us $10. There was no wait at either the player's counter nor The Buffet line. Must mean something. This place is very ordinary even though they served snow crab legs during breakfast. It served it's purpose for the day. Since we were riding the roller coasters on top of the stratosphere, it was a one-stop shopping place. I can't see any other reason to eat here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This was my first Cirque show ever so maybe that's why I was so confused. Honestly, the entire time during the show I kept thinking, WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON??? My friends and I got some amazing seats. We sat in section 106, about 6 rows from the stage (the performers were right next to us when they entered). Found a great deal online and only paid $99 for those. I was surprised that they didn't play as many mainstream Beatles songs as I thought they would, many of them I have never even heard of. Most of the show was a lot of interpretive dance, people running all over the place, stuff thrown everywhere. It took me a few songs in to figure out there is no storyline, just a live music video. I think I would've enjoyed it more if I knew what was happening the entire time, it was too many things happening all at once. There's a weird part where they pull a sheet over the entire audience so you'll get knocked by this giant white sheet. It's sort of cool when they suck the whole sheet under the stage afterward. I want one of those helmets they wore while on the rollarblades! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Typically a place like this is not my thing but a smoothie called and I wanted something a little healthier so I checked this place out. The vibe here is a little strange. Feels like an extension of LVAC and I'm the only lazy bum who didn't work up a sweat prior to coming here lol. The decor is modern yet feels green and nature-inspired. I really like the look of this place. I paid an arm and a leg for my Green Leaf Berry Blast smoothie (note: 1 dollar off for checking in) and I almost had buyer's remorse as I waited in line. The line moved quickly enough and service was friendly but, hot damn, it took FOREVER to get my smoothie. It's the only thing I ordered - no food, just a smoothie to go. And I waited. And waited. And waited. Finally my name was called and I thought for sure this was going to be an out-of-this-world smoothie experience. All the hype, all the waiting, all that cash I forked over... built up to this moment. I try the smoothie and I'm all, ""eh"". Oh the sweet sting of health-food disappointment. I give it 3 stars because I like the concept and the decor, the service was good, and there are quite a few things on the menu I really want to try (pizza, wraps, etc.), so I'm sure I'll be back to update this.

 My sister and I traveled to Charlotte to attend to some family business. Make no mistake, what we were doing was work. But we made time for meals and the occasional cocktail or three. We Yelped, of course, and found 5Church. Damn were we lucky to have stumbled onto this gem. It's located just off the Tryon commercial strip that offers a number of upscale chain restaurants. Not what we were looking for, nor were they serving, to our good fortune. 5Church was serving their all day Sunday brunch menu. We sat at corner of the bar where they served the full menu- a limited selection, but with a number of interesting possibilities. I opted for the hanger steak and fries, which came with their own C-1 sauce. It was delicious. The beef was perfectly seasoned and seared. The sauce should be bottled. Bob, the burly bearded bartender, asked for our drink order. I asked for a margarita with whatever tequila he recommended. Bob asked if I wanted the best margarita I'd ever had. He did not disappoint. He muddled fresh limes and oranges, covered them with ice and simple syrup. Then he added a good measure of (wait for it) Cuervo Gold. Cocktail shaken. Glass rim salted. Drink decanted, fruit and all. Fantastic. We returned Monday night to our same seats and met Evan, a young mixologist on a mission. After Goose martinis, we extolled Bob's awesome margarita. Evan took that as a challenge and produced a signature cocktail he was perfecting, The Peppadew Pepper Lemonade. Muddled lemons, vodka, Peppedew pepper juice, cayenne pepper. Shake to a froth. Top off with a splash of ginger ale. Garnish with the pepper. Sweet, tart, spicy, refreshing. Delicious. The food was as good as on Sunday. We went back two more times in the four days we were in town. We had a lamb burger (me, awesome) and crispy beet sliders (she). I'm not a fan of beets, but the sister loved these fantastic bites. Met the owners who told use they'd been open for just 6 weeks. 5Church should break the curse of other establishments that had failed at the corner of 5th and Church. I'm looking forward to returning as soon as I can find a reason. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I'm a shabu fanatic and idk maybe I'm just being biased because Vegas is just not up to par with SoCal shabu standards...? but this place did not impress me at all. The meat (I ordered kobe chuck) had great texture, but the flavor was off. The peanut sauce was sort of chunky and too sweet. The veggie plate was very very very minimal and not fresh. They did not have the option of brown rice. Service was super slow. The only reason for a star? The sushi chef was so nice! And one more star for the delicious spicy tuna roll. BUT isn't this place supposed to be known for its shabu? MEHHHHHHHHHH. ",0,1,0,0,0

 So we've been back about three more times because I've developed a wings addiction that is bordering on troublesome. Seriously, I might need an intervention. The wings continue to be *delicious*... although we've started to notice we aren't getting 12 in a basket. Last time it was 10. The size hasn't increased... hmmm... The increased star is for the fries. It is no secret that the fries at Zipps are not the best. (See this talk thread: http://www.yelp.com/topic/gilbert-now-that-the-lockout-is-over-lets-talk-sports-bars) The flavor is good, but they are always soggy and limp. This Sunday (7/24/11 at 8pm) they were AWESOME! Crisp, firm, and soft on the inside! It was shocking, I tell you! SHOCKING! Can you please do this more often? This should be the standard, not the exception. ",0,0,0,1,0

 You come to Edinburgh and don't come here if you are a tourist? If you grew up here you probably came here once when you were a kid avoided the place because it is full of tourist. But since I was visiting as a tourist I came to check this place out. The Castle dominates the surrounding area with great views of the city, it is a little pricey to get in but I think it has a number of well curated museums if you are into history and in particular military history. There are the rolls for a number of wars/battles for the fallen, and each of the Scottish Military Regiments have their Regimental museums here too. The are aplenty so bring a camera with lots of memory, a jacket and a bottle of water. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place is back to being a normal Pei Wei for those who are concerned. With that said, I'm not really sure what niche Pei Wei occupies. If I want Asian fast food, I'd rather get Panda Express which is simultaneously cheaper, tastier, and healthier. If I'm willing to spend more is rather just go to a normal Asian restaurant. I was never a fan of Pei Wei in Tucson but decided to give this location a shot since I had a coupon for a free meal. I got a cup of the Thai wonton soup, which was fairly tasty but for 1.99 it looked like enough to fill maybe a tea cup. For an entree I tried the spicy Korean with shrimp and white rice. The whole meal was basically a flavorless morass. Two stars for good customer service and fortune cookies but would not go back on my own. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was so excited to eat at this place. I ate at babo and loved it. i went with two friends. the wine list was great and the server let me try two to decide what i wanted. i liked that. the bread, butter and lardo was great. i asked the waiter for his favorite pasta and he recommended the beef cheek ravioli. i love it when a waiter has an opinion. my friends ordered a strip well done and filet medium. my rav came out. it had no impact on the plate. no garnish and a small portion. it was good, not great. my friends steaks were way underdone. the fliet which was supposed to be medium was Medium rare to rare. the sirloin was was medium/medium rare. they both sent them back. the filet was still a bit underdone. the strip was still medium. my friend sent it back one more time. we finished our meals before he got his steak back. they comped a dessert which was great - trio of gelatos and comped one glass of wine. the service was great, but the food was disappointing.

 Let me preface this by saying this place is going downhill. It's gotten pretty seedy lately with lots of unsavory characters and trolls sitting at the bar. Like drug scene and shady, but if you are into that, have at it. I ain't judgin' you, just not my thing. The DJ's here are usually pretty good, so that's good if you want to dance, yet the dance floor is quite tiny. It's somewhat difficult to get served here unless it's the guy bartender with glasses and a baseball cap. He's very attentive, the rest are either snobby or indifferent to your existence and mine clearly. I'll tell you a story, last month I stopped in (even though someone that used to work there said it's no good and scary now) for a drink, and well, I did not get a drink. I wanted a drink, I was thirsty, but the bartender was too busy chatting, then getting on her smartphone to wait on me. Some guy came from behind the bar and I asked him if he'd wait on me and he said, ""ummm...I'd help you, but she doesnt want me messing with her drawer."" So, that's it. no more remedy for me.

 If you're looking for a romantic or trendy vibe, this is the perfect spot to be. Foodies rejoice! Le Filet is in an unassuming neighborhood - you would never suspect such a fine dining experience in the middle of what seems like a residential neighborhood. The second we walked in there we were treated like royalty - customer service is sublime here. Maybe because we brought our bachelorette decked out in bachelorette gear, but they were attentive and right on when it comes to making sure we got everything we needed, from bartender and water to plates and timing. Everything here is made to share, and they bring dishes out in waves, replacing your plates and utensils with each wave. It's really fantastic. In addition to a couple bottles of wine and a couple rounds of shots for the 7 of us, all of which were phenomenal, we ordered. The # of asterisks indicates how FANTASTIC the dish was, and how highly I would recommend it.

 DONT PLAY STAY FAR AWAY!!! Its dosent matter how clean a place is to a certain point if the owner and workers are mean and horrible.First problem is they never open on time 10:00 am means you get there 10 to 5 minutes eariler and set up.Because i end up with my son screaming in the back wanting to go in.The last time i said something and they told me to go else where really?.Another problem is the back in the place where there a water fountain is, the floor is a hard title no mats kids and younger kids run back there and can easily slip.So with floor being tile they can get serious hurt i told them that they said nothing we can do.They should have said oh thats not good lets see what we can do.They can get those black mats that they use in hotel kitchens that would work and not cost to much but they dont care.My son had way to much close calls so in my opion i would not take my child there they cant be trusted!

 I went there tonight and had their wings and burger. Both were awesome. I always get my wings extra crispy and very hot with blue cheese. They didn't have blue cheese but I reluctantly ordered anyhow. The wings were neither crispy or very hot. The set up was perfect for a disaster. As it turned out, the garlic ranch was pretty awesome, and the wings fell off the bone. They were extremely tasty as well. Needless to say, quite a nice surprise. The burger was fantastic as well. Not a huge selection of beers, about 5 in total but the pumpkin kilt lifter and IPA were good. Bartender actually was there for more than just a paycheck which is odd these days. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I'm always craving shabu shabu and having eating at some of the best places in LA and SF, I figured I would give this place a try and see how they stack up. For being in Vegas it's actually pretty good, but compared to other places that I have been it's ok, especially for the price. We came for dinner on a Saturday night and it wasn't crowded at all. Be sure to check in on Yelp so that you can get the check in offer of free hot sake or 2 piece nigiri sushi. I chose the nigiri sushi and got the super white tuna (pretty good) and my friend also checked in and got the hamachi (also pretty good). Not the best sushi, but for a place that doesn't specialize in sushi, it was worth the free offer. I went for the shabu shabu dinner - they have a variety of meats that you can choose from and different grades of beef - for shabu it is on the pricier side - 8 oz for $18.95 of the regular beef (especially when you can get all you can eat in SF for $29.95 - maybe I should recommend this to them). They also have a few selections of broths - I chose my usual favorite of spicy miso. The flavor of the broth was good and the quality of the meat was good too. I think they could give you more of a selection of vegetables (and maybe just plain more vegetables). It comes on a small plate and definitely not a lot of it - cabbage, 2 pieces of broccoli, a few carrots, and 1 mushroom cut up (just regular mushroom, not enoki or any other kind). Overall, a decent place that I would come back to if I was craving shabu, but my search for SF/LA quality shabu continues in Vegas. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I already don't like buffets so when I came here after having to wait in line for 40 mins I was seriously disappointed. Most of the food was just standard fare with some of the Middle Eastern stuff being interesting. Unlike the Bellagio where I ate until I felt like my stomach would pop I ate very sparingly here. The only memorable thing that happened here was my friend telling me that he wanted me to go with him to the 24 hr marriage chapel to be the witness (and take pics) so he could get hitched with his girl that nite.. while I was trying to get some lamb chops.. it seemed kinda surreal at the moment.

 We had a reservation at the bar at 9:30pm the place was jammed but it probably always feels like that since it is so small. The outdoor patio is impressive but mostly their garden, it is crazy! It's huge and it makes you feel good as you know you will be eating fresh from their backyard! The staff is very nice and the food is great. WE had oysters from PEI, wish there were more choice but at least they were fresh! We were served cocktails from jar, original. We tried the chichitos which were excellent, and also the amazing beignes dipped in maple syrup with house smoked cheddar melting all over them!! Mmmmm!!! It was delicious. We didn't eat much because I noticed that the plates were overwhelming, meaning way too much food!!! Not the typical french restaurant portion.

 I remember being really nervous the first time I ate here, as I was meeting my boyfriend's parents. In fact, I was talking so much that I'm surprised I managed to get any food down me at all. Which would have been a shame, as the food here is phenomenal. I had a mozzarella, roast peppers and sun-dried tomato salad for my starter, which was drizzled in their home-made pesto and was absolutely amazing. The main course was just as tasty, and unlike a lot of risotto dishes in restaurants it didn't leave me feeling really stodgy and too full by the end, whilst still being a decent-sized portion. In fact, everyone's main courses looked gorgeous, but as it was my first time meeting the family I didn't think we were really at the ""nicking food off eachothers' plates"" stage yet, so I couldn't tell you how they tasted. The prices are perfect too. It costs just enough that you know the service and quality of it all is going to be great, but not so pricey that you need a special occasion to justify going. Which is handy, when you liked it as much as I did. Next time I'm out in this area of the city centre in the evening and want somewhre to go eat, I'll definitely be going here. ",0,0,0,0,1

We paid for front row and only needed the seat moved the 2 inches we were hanging past the seat and they refused saying they need aisles for the actors even thought he would still be there irregardless if the seat moved or not.

 Listen to other poor reviews. This is the worst Pizza Hut I've ever gone to. The lobby closes at 8:30 and they make you pick up through a drive thru which gets backed up quickly.

 Dinette looked so cute but was a big let down. We ordered an appetizer, fritto misto, which was really good. The zucchini flowers were crispy and delicious, the batter wasn't too heavy, and the portion was surprisingly big for an appetizer. And yeungling cans were $1. So far so good! BUT none of this can make up for how bland our pizza was. We got the grilled corn pizza to split (which was a perfect size for two people considering we split that large appetizer) which had grilled corn and brie in addition to a few other toppings. The toppings were scant and placed mostly in the center of the pizza, leaving about 60% of the pizza as just break with cheese...not too exciting. I can see why people like the crust (it was thin and crispy) but if there's nothing to spice it up it's still just flat bread. Considering the price of the pizza they need to increase the amount of toppings and make sure the entire area of the pizza has flavor. Adorable atmosphere but I'll go somewhere else. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I was very surprised by this place. It's kind of tucked away in the corner of the strip mall it resides in and the sign doesn't draw much attention but thanks to Yelp, we found it. The surprise for me was the gluten free options. They were very tasty! We've been back several times and the servers know me by drink :) So far, everything I have ate has been delicious. The only thing I would change is the portion size on some of the dishes but that's just cuz I have a big appetite, it's tasty and I want more. Fortunately, that is usually solved by going during ""Halfy Hour"" where EVERYTHING on the menu is half price (and yes, I order two. Kinda defeats the whole half thing but whatever). Good food, great service and lots of gluten free options. You can't go wrong with Tryst. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The Internet connection is so slow. I could barely check e-mail. The televisions are inconveniently placed in the family suites. The beds are stiff and the water in the sink and shower smell and tastes severely of bleach. The walls are so thin just having a conversation in normal tones in our room brought a noise complaint. The bar closes way too early although the bartender Valerie was a charming woman, very skilled at mixing drinks. The rides were fun but the stairs to get there were not. At least we avoided sunburns, although it was rainy outside anyways. The games around the hotel look like fun, but too expensive for our tastes. The main gift shop had some decent jewelry. The second gift shop was kind of hidden but had some neat stuff in it. The wave pool was lame. The food was a bit overpriced, but I did take advantage of the omelette bar, just be up really early for it. Probably never coming back because it's all too expensive. ",0,1,0,0,0

 If it wasn't for the bad food I would go here more than once or twice a year. The meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second. Now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie, I order a salad only. Because they do catering, I have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers. The service is OK. They have a couple of generic draft beers. Everything is overpriced. Caveat Emptor if you order an entree. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This place reaffirms my philosophy that, when eating with a group, sampling is deadly. But I'll get to that later. Right off the bat, I liked the decor, but I've also been going to school in Tucson for the last 4 years sooo... I'm easily impressed. If only the food could mirror the wonder of the interior design. I ordered the Katsu Bento which was overcooked to the point where it resembled shoe leather, and I ended up giving away two pieces of my sashimi since there were no substitutes and I was really only craving salmon sashimi. Obviously, I was disappointed. I did try my mom's grouper and mushroom appetizer which was piled high on a bed of mashed potatoes, and it was freaking bomb! As in, taste bud explosion! Oh yes, gotta love that I'm-going-to-be-salivating-over-someone-else's-lunch-the-entire-time-because-theirs-is-way-better meal! See, sampling is deadly. I also ordered the mochi dessert which I assumed was ice cream mochi. Ah, silly me - why didn't I automatically know that ""Mochi"" meant sherbet mochi? It was kind of gross and weird as I am not a fan of sherbet, but if that's your thing then go for it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I hate to rain on the parade of 5 stars, but I was not impressed with my pizza. I ordered for delivery through foodie call and had a custom pizza made of goat cheese, proscuitto, and arugula - my go to. The pizza came within the expected time frame (45 minutes) and I was excited to give it a try. The first red flag (you can see by the picture) is all the toppings were plopped in the center. Who likes eating their pizza with no toppings on the outside and then mounds of it on the other side? I spent the next 5 minutes redistributing the toppings so it was evenly dispersed throughout the pie. Second, where was the proscuitto?! There were tiny cut up bits of what tasted like ham sprinkled on top, but definitely not the thin slices of salty, savory proscuitto deliciousness I was expecting. The ancient grain crust, however, was very good and I also enjoyed the brown sugar cinnamon dipping sauce that came with it. I'm willing to give Pure Pizza another try...but I'll surely be there in person to voice my criticisms. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I ordered a brownie sundae and waited for about 20 minutes after paying to get it. They were ""changing shifts"" but somehow proceeded to make hotdogs with all the toppings for people who ordered after me. I also tried ordering a large bottle of water and they rang it up at $8, to which i said no thanks. I am from NY and work in NYC and i've never seen such an outrageous price for just water. All of the Walgreens i went to in Vegas were selling the same size water bottles for about $2.29. I don't see why they feel the need to rip people off when it comes to water, their ice cream is already over-priced and it was just OK. I'm not picky at all and i know Vegas is expensive but this was hands down the most dissappointing place i went to there. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It's more like a 3.5 star rating. As it is with Cirque shows, there just seems to be a lot of random stuff going on. I didn't notice a storyline (so far only KA has one), which is pretty normal for a Cirque show. I definitely wouldn't put this on the top of my Vegas Cirque shows. I noticed that one act from KA wasn't in this showing (even though I see a picture of it here on yelp) and a co-worker had told me about it. So maybe they're changing it each time or something. *shrugs* Not too much stood out to me in this show so it's just okay. For now, at least. Who knows what will be changed in the future. I've seen all the Vegas Cirque shows... 1. KA (MGM) 2. Mystere (TI) 3. ""O"" (Bellagio) 4. Michael Jackson Immortals 5. LOVE (Mirage) 6. Viva Elvis (Aria) *gone 7. Zumanity (NYNY) 8. Criss Angel Believe (don't bother with this show) That's pretty much the right order in terms of preference, too. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Sedona has alot of potential if realized but some changes need to be made before it gets there... I checked out Sedona yesterday with my Dad for lunch. Being a vegetarian, the first thing he noticed was that they took the vegan burger patty off the menu and replaced it with a caprise paninni sandwich. Unfortantely, adding in large pieces of cheese and a balsamic vinegar glaze to the sandwich isn't really a substitute for a vegetarian burger. I as usual got a the standard 'Cali Club' which I feel like is the only thing you can probably order anywhere and not go wrong. My sandwich was good but not amazing. It seems like they used the thickness of the texas toast slices to make up for not putting in much turkey or bacon into the sandwich. At about $14 I expected a little more. I think one of the issues that really brought down my review rating here was the service. Coming in at around 1pm I noticed that they place was virtually empty. There are maybe two other parties in the main dining area near the bar. However, there a ton of employees (easily out numbering the diners) that were all running around doing something other than serving us. We had to wave down our server to get a ride of ranch and refills on drinks. I think I have stated this in my other reviews, and I'll do it again: I hate having to flag down servers for refills and the check. If we have to go hunt them down, why even have servers? One of the redeeming aspects of Sedona is definitely the place itself. Sedona Lounge is beautiful. The outer architecture and interior design is definitely a step-above the other bar-food restaurants the place is usually compared to. The interior looks like a high-end steak house and the patio is probably one of the nicest in town. Now I have heard some great things about Sedona from friends which makes me want to give the place a second chance. Maybe I went on a off-day or something, it was disappointing after hearing praise from some of my fellow yelpers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I love a good steak and have no problem paying for one, but Prime's is not worth the price. We had two different cuts, the porterhouse and the dry-aged bone-in ribeye. The quality of the steak might have been there, but the preparation of it threw the whole thing off. However, I did really like the sauce that accompanied the steaks, so much so that we requested some in leftover box. We had truffle mashed potatoes that were divine (but honestly, it's truffle so how bad could it be?) but the glazed carrots were tangy, which I did not like at all. As for the appetizers, we shared the Caesar salad which was fabulous. The presentation was unique in that it was a whole head of romaine lettuce (I'll post a picture). Service was confusing to say the least. Our server was very nice and friendly, but very condescending. Maybe it was because we look young, but when we asked a question about the mushrooms he became very patronizing towards us. The same when we wanted coffee. It was very odd. We also waited a long time for little things like the coffee, bread, butter, etc. They didn't even bring bread until we asked for it. I much prefer returning to Craftsteak on the Strip. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Tips N Toes Rocks. First class service. I recommend: (1) calling ahead to inquire about pricing, (2) making an appointment. The services are worth every penny. Comments on G.M.'s review below: a 15 min wait time is reasonable....complaining about having to wait, then complaining about being 'rushed through' - I doubt GM is easy to satisfy no matter what the situation. Prices are reasonable for a salon of this caliber. The Tips N Toes is busy.....because they are one of the best spas around. No loss if GM never returns.........less waiting for the rest of us!

 I like the review of the whacked waiter... i think he may be still at work at 'Cantina Laredo' cuz i think he served us....... Called ahead after a Cardinals game to make sure there was room enough for our party of 10- "" No problem "" we were told , come on down. arrived 9:00 ish on a beautiful 80F evening in Scottsdale -stepped across a half empty patio into the spacious Cantina - chilled to an ungodly 60F- Note to the great state of Arizona : (the reason that y'all are booming and experiencing sustained in-migration is because people are like lizards--- ( in more ways than one)---they like the sun , they like the heat ... they flee from northern climes to get away from the chill - Don't AC your premises such that it reminds us of Duluth in winter.... we just escaped Duluth in winter and fled south to thaw ) . we asked for a spot on the patio and our man immediately declined stating that "" he had already set a table for us inside""- upon my wife's insistence that he reevaluatethe patio he disappeared for a moment or two and then reappeared - affirming that the half empty patio was indeed full. this puzzled my wife who then surmised that : A) he wanted our large party in his section -not the patio B) there would likely be a built in minimum gratuity on the final bill ( there was) after taking our drink order ,(competently), he returned with salsa and chips. The salsa he described as being of two types ""hot "" or ""regular""- there were indeed two temperatures -but they appeared to be seperated thermally rather than chemically -?? the same salsa one served at room temperature , one served chilled...??? when asked about the best dishes for people who wanted a little kick to their food he replied: "" I wouldn't really know , I don't like spicy food"" ????????????????? Dude , can you not at least fake something.... it is after all a Mexican restaurant. If people want spice they go Mexican - if they want bland they seek out a Saskatchewan restaurant - non? The meal was salvaged - ( not saved), by a compatriot of our man who hailed from Durango- he spoke knowledgeably about the menu , filled our empty margarita glasses and retreated into the kitchen to assemble , on our behalf , a pepper mole sauce that was truely outstanding. The food was uninspired -( there was a Baja Grill of some sort across the parking lot and we wondered if they shared a kitchen...) , the service was poor ( excepting our hombre from Mejico ), and the casa freakishly cold-- Two stars tops over all but boosted up to three by our amigo from Victoria de Durango ",0,0,1,0,0

 Disclaimer: I'm not being fair as I have zero tolerance for food prepared for 200 people sitting in the chafing dish for hours slowly getting burnt on the bottom and cold on the top. It is ironic to have to wait for 45 minutes to be seated (and be $24.95 + tax poorer), considering that I managed to get into The Bank the night before with no wait (and not have to be out of pocket). In any case, the food never fails to disappoint. I once watched a feature on TV (PS: the only thing that I watch is Food Network and Travel... and occassional bit of American Idol) on how they source the ingredients for buffet food. While it was not able to gross me out and put me off buffet forever, it's enough to get me into thinking that the prime rib that they had served in Le Village Buffet is the one that is near or past the expiry date @ Les Artistes. I could not help but be slightly perturbed. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I arrived at eleven just as the place was opening. There was a line of people to get in, which was reassuring. The fact that I think I was the only caucasian person was also reassuring. The server/host was friendly, though maybe a little overworked. I ordered the vegetables with garlic sauce and was left unimpressed. I paid 8 dollars for what seemed to be simply a plate of slightly steamed vegetables with a tad bit of sauce. Nothing terrible about my dish, but I think next time I patronize Saigon Noodles I will order something that's not on the last page of the menu. :) ",0,0,1,0,0

 Only giving some stars because they actually changed my oil without problems. But the experience was not good! I asked for my brakes to be checked. When they were done with my oil, they started to send me out on my way until I asked about my brakes. I overheard the attendant ask the tech about my brakes and he replied ""Oh sh*t I forgot! Tell her she needs her front brakes replaced"". I walked out ! ! ! Take note that I had just had the front brake pads replaced just 3 months prior, but it was my rear brakes that were almost shot. I had SunCare Auto fix them for me at a great deal. If I had minded Purrfect, I would have had new brakes replaced again and the rear brakes would have never been taken care of and God knows what could have happened then.

 When I first came to U of I, the first things I learned were how to register for classes, how to live in the dorms, and to make sure that I try pokey sticks from Gumby's.

 I enjoy Town Square, but it's not my favorite. I don't spend enough time there to know my way around without driving driving driving through all the roads, and I mean all of them.

 HORRIBLE!!! I've been to several foot spas in multiple states. My mom and I asked for an hour massage. Her person started first and another person was due in. No problem. When my masseuse arrived he had no idea what he was doing and mom's masseuse talked him thru every step of the massage. It felt like I was being petted. When we were paying, $40 for an hour, we were only going to tip $5 as they talked the entire hour, were not relaxing, and my guy didn't know what he was doing. The lady said we HAD to tip a minimum of $10 because the owner takes all of the $40 and the workers were only paid in tips. YELP a different spa. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Beware!! They didn't even deserve a one star. This company and leasing managers are racist and treat people like they are nothing. All they want is you to sign on the dotted line and they got you! The 1 bedroom apartment we rented was a fucking DUMP when we moved in. The ceiling fan was ready to fall on our heads, there was black all over the a/c vents and the shelves in the closet were literally falling off the wall and the carpet had huge nasty stains everywhere. We were told our place was clean and ready to move in. I have a medical condition called Cystic Fibrosis, I am on a lot of medication and my meds get delivered by UPS or FedEx to the front office. After the third box of my meds arrived, in about a weeks time, the leasing staff labeled me as being contagious and treated me like dirt. After being there for two months, my doctor at MUSC in Charleston told me I have to live close to the hospital in order to get proper treatment and be able to go into the hospital when I am sick. We gave a written notice to the leasing manager and a doctors letter. The manager said, oh that's fine don't worry about it feel better (in her fake voice). Now, two years later I see they have put me on collection for $2000. No way will they get away with this. Do not rent from these Losers! How do they sleep at night ",1,0,0,0,0

 Get here early if you go on Friday night. Otherwise you will wait 20 minutes for a table or else sit in the bar. The Bar isn't bad because they do have tables. This is very good que. They cook the whole pig but it's not really smoked or seasoned too much. They let you add the vingegar based sauce or the tomato based yourself. They have an excellent choice of combo items on the menu. Ribs and chicken or chicken and catfish or any combination with ribs and pulled pork or even chicken wings. Parking can be a tough. The service is good and the prices are fair as you get good sized portions. I'm not real keen on their sauce which is kind of a bummer because they don't really season their meat too much. I like that they have a full bar and if you order a beer you get a 16 oz pint glass that's frosted. Tonite, Liz took care of us...she calls everyone honey. She made sure everything is good.

 Checked out this place from the groupon last night. Friday night at 750 most tables were full ONE server. ordered our food, the the wings that were small and undercooked with generic sauce. got some garlic bread that we did enjoy. we had our drinks and all 3 cups were empty with some ice and I put them at the end of the table hoping the ONE server would notice, we had to call her over for refills, she said for which ones...... (I should have said only the EMPTY ones) ALL of our dishes from the garlic bread and wings sat on the table the ENTIRE time. we ordered the White pizza and realized when we got it there was no ricotta on it. I didnt want to complain I was tired of this place. The table behind us never had their pizza put in and they sat after us, and barely got their pizza as we were talking out the door. OIL everywhere on the pizza. That should not happen with white pizza. Here is the kicker, from about 820pm (FRIDAY NIGHT) they turned away 3 groups of people because ""they had NOTHING left in the kitchen"" Really? you put out a groupon not preparing for the influx of customers?!?!??!

 So it helps when you visit this place and get seated in the main section. The last time we were here we sat in the bar, and everything was fine. This time we came in with some friends, and sat in the main area. We were greeted promptly by the friendly staff. I have to give some credit to our waitress as our group had two english only speakers, one spanish only speaker, someone who was bilingual and a child. Our waitress was able to easily switch back and forth between english and spanish to assist us. The salsa has definitely improved since our last visit. The medium was really chunky and the mild had much more flavor. The chips really are incredible here...probably the best I've had it town. Very crunchy, a bit oily but they are also very large. I had the taco salad. Its more of a hard shelled burrito than a salad. There is lettuce, but there are more beans and cheese than lettuce. The salad also has guacamole, salsa, sour cream and olives. I had without the meat, but you can get the meat on it. The portion was huge. After indulging in chips and salsa, I maybe conquered half of it. This place does have a roving magician/balloon animal artist. He was a little less aggressive than others I've seen, which was nice. We definitely had a better experience, and will probably be back.

 Holy God, I should have checked the reviews before eating here. Because of my tragic inability to read a map, I apparently walked to the completely wrong end of the Atrium in search of Salsaritas. Near some other unsavory selections, this seemed to be the quick & easy choice. I'm no stranger to food court Chinese. In fact, I used to look forward to stopping in the mall with mom and brother to cheaply nibble on the toothpicked free samples of sweet & sour chicken before buying a plate and splitting it three-ways. Americanized Chinese food is comfort food in a way. Dependable, affordable, tasty. This was none of those things. I went for the two-item dish which comes with rice (no white rice or brown rice option; only fried). I chose General Tso's and Beef & Broccoli. Both were dished up in IDENTICAL sauces. Let's call it Brown Sauce. Brown Sauce has no flavor. And it's cornstarched to hell, so it's thick and blubbery like day-old gravy. Brown Sauce has no business being on General Tso's Chicken. Brown Sauce made me embarrassed FOR my food. I ended up dumping half my meal... and I never do that. I love CLT's classy atrium, but can't recommend this dining option.

 This was my first time getting a Brazilian done. The woman who did mine was very friendly and answered all my questions and concerns. She was very professional and considerate. She also asked me several times if I was still doing OK and let me know we could take a break if I needed to. The process took about twenty minutes and although it's painful (not as bad as I imagined) it is completely worth it ladies! Your husbands will love you! They offer your first wax at $20 and then I believe it goes up to $35. My only dislike was the fact that their ingrown hair serum was $20 for me to purchase. I have very sensitive skin and I get razor bumps/ingrown hairs a lot so if this serum does work I will be very happy but it's still a little on the pricey side.

 A few of my girlfriends and I went to an afternoon tea at the Mandarin after a fun weekend in Vegas. The Tea Lounge is located on the 23rd floor and we were seated next to the floor length windows with a view of the City Center. The decor in the lounge was a lacking and felt outdated. There are only a small amount of tables for tea service...probably about 8 or so. The area is open and is shared with the reception desks. Our seating area was two couches and a table which was a bit higher than a coffee table. The seating was not the most comfortable arrangement and the table was small for the amount of pots, plates and cups. For $36 a person (not including tax and gratuity), we had three tiers of delightful scones, tea sandwiches and desserts. The scones were my favorite because they were light, buttery and served with homemade jams and the best Devonshire cream. The desserts were small bite sized chocolates, cakes/tarts, macarons which were beautiful. The finger sandwiches were ok but the presentation was very pretty. I ordered the Monkey Picked Oolong tea because it sounded interesting. Supposedly monkeys were trained to pick the choicest leaves from wild tea trees, which were enjoyed exclusively by the Imperial Court. The service was great. All the staff are very informative on the different types of teas and can suggest one to your liking. All in all, an afternoon tea with the girls is always a fun way to end your trip in Vegas!

 I've been studying with Mahin for about a year now and it has been some of the best time, energy and money spent on anything in my life. I've always loved to dance but never invested this much in any style and frankly exercise has never been my favorite word. Now I can't imagine not showing up every week for class. It's become a part of my life; keeping stress at bay and giving me an outlet for my creativity. Mahin challenges us every day but keeps the atmosphere casual and welcoming; working patiently with each student until they get it. She not only shares the steps of the dance but also it's cultural signficance really giving us an appreciation and understanding of it in context. If you are looking for a teacher who is patient, fun and challenging, I cannot recommend Mahin highly enough. You'll work your butt off in her class but I guarantee you'll enjoy it. Oh and I also wanted to add that she is very active in the local belly dancing community which is especially helpful to new students who find that they want to get involved and become a part of it. It's not required of course but the opportunity is there. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Way too expensive compared to the food quality at other Strip buffets. The fish was nothing to write home about, the crab legs so-so, and the lobster was tiny and overcooked. The sushi was actually sashimi. All in all, disappointing. ",0,1,0,0,0

 For me, Paradise Bakery is a poor man's Panera. I don't think it's nearly as organized, friendly or tasty as Panera, although the price is much better at Paradise. Paradise Bakery is disappointing in a few ways. First, I really really hate when places just have pictures of sandwiches on the display board and provide absolutely zero written description. Oh, I see I'm just supposed to guess what is on that sandwich that has a picture in the most inconvenient spot in the whole freaking place. Wonderful. Second, the caesar salad is horrible. I took my first bite yesterday and instantly remembered why I swore I would never order another one from Paradise again. I managed to choke most of it down, but seriously what is wrong with their caesar dressing??? It has a very funny, and not in a good way, taste to it. Also the croutons are not very tasty either. Third, they completely use too much dressing on their salads. Excuse me, but can I have some lettuce to go with that dressing?? And finally, for a bakery, I don't particularly find the cookies and pastries I have tried to be all that amazing. The chocolate/white chocolate chip cookie I tried yesterday was a bit on the dry side and not very chewy/soft at all. Boo. The two bright spots are 1) the price...my salad and medium drink was $6.23 which isn't a bad deal at all and 2)the number of tables outside this location where you can escape the office to enjoy a nice, leisurely lunch on a beautiful Arizona day. But if you are craving a salad or sandwich, there are better options in the downtown area. ",0,1,0,0,0

 $100+ for four guys to each get a burger. All weekend long we planned to get the Daniel Boulud kobe/short rib/truffle burger but we were running out of time and so we settled on the Burger Bar instead. The thing about this place is that even though there are endless ways of customizing your burger (choice of meat / bun / toppings / cheese / sauces), most of the time you just want to choose from a combination of toppings. There are a few combinations but none of them sound very good except for a kobe/truffle burger and a burger with lobster in it. I chose to go custom: ridgefield beef, bleu cheese, bacon, and a black truffle sauce on ciabatta with a side of sweet potato fries. My verdict? Pretty awesome. Total damage? 30something dollars. Not too bad, the price of a buffet and either way I'm stuffed. The other cool thing about this place is it has a very extensive list of beers. They had hitachino beer here but sadly only the lacto and hef here. I don't recommend any of those. The thing that sucks is it is a small place, it gets busy, and theres no place to sit and wait. There's shopping but you know Vegas and seating... only at the tables or in front of the slot machines. It's in a mall. They need beepers so you can venture away without worrying about losing your spot. 3 stars for it was good and I might come here again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have heard great things about this place so I was really looking forward to trying it out. The atmosphere is perfect! I love the set up, not too bright a good intimate feel but not very dark either. I have to give the drinks a 5 star rating they have amazing cocktails ...I however wasn't too impressed with my meal. The waiter was great but I don't like how the shrimp came out. I like my shrimp meaty texture (i.e Enso style) but theirs were like that squishy not cooked all the way type and I really don't like that. I actually ended up not eating my meal :-/. However, my friends chicken was really good so I didn't want to give them less than 4 stars just for the shrimp. I will go back for another dish and see how it goes. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Because I was here on someone else's dime, I enjoyed the food very much. I had the pork ramen and the salmon carpaccio. Living in Austin, ramen is like rain, very, very scarce.

The salmon carpaccio had wonderful olive oil, mint, and light seasoning that I loveeeeeeee. $7 for a 12oz Sapporo? Well, this is Vegas.

 It's not a good sign when your restaurant serves something that is so bad, your customer is still talking about how bad it was literally half of a year later. And that's exactly what happened the last time I ordered a grilled tomato basil veggie sandwich here. Seriously, take that shit off your menu. It was an absolutely foul excuse for cooking that had to have been conjured up by an extremely high, extremely overweight vegetarian. I don't know what I could even call that thing. Was it some kind of attempt at a new twist on pizza? It certainly was saturated in enough crappy cheese and tomato sauce to seem like it. That floppy piece of tomato-soaked toast on the bottom might have been part of an aborted attempt at a sandwich. And why do all the vegetables have the same taste and texture as tofu? How do you even screw that up, and why on a ""veggie sandwich""? Hawk's has a pretty good beer selection in addition to very friendly bartenders. So as a bar they're doing an okay job. This is unfortunately just about all they have going for them. The burgers and fries are unmemorable, there are no waiters, the kitchen staff (from whom you must order and pick up like a cafeteria) is surly, and the bar only takes cash - which doesn't help given that this place is expensive as fuck.

 I definitely enjoyed my experience at ONoir, but i'd probably recommend going only once. If you've made a reservation, you're coming for the experience, not the food. I had the eggplant appetizer and Marinaded Shrimp. The quality of the food was very average. The eggplant was soggy and small portioned. The shrimp was delicious, but the accompanying rice and vegetables were over sauced and overcooked. However, the ambiance was great. There was a live jazz band playing behind us, which complimented the mainly French speaking diners who were enjoying their meals. Again, a memorable experience. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is all coming from a girl who just needs a relatively clean place, a bed that isn't concrete, air conditioning and running water in Vegas. I don't need pretty, I don't need all that snotty stuff. So I was originally going to stay at the Sahara... that's where I usually stay... it's cheap, easy, and on the strip. But I saw the prices were comparable here (average of $50 a night, holiday weekend) and decided to give this place a try. Things I like about this place: ~ You actually win in this casino. My only thought is that it's like that because it's not on the strip. ~ The $1.50 Bud/BudLight/Bud Lime! The best thing about the whole place. The other beers cost $5.50. Yikes. ~ Photos of hot chicks everywhere. Funny tho... I didn't actually see any hot chicks. Except the one chick running cocktails to the gamblers... but she was the only one. ~ The beds are pretty soft and comfy. Pillows leave something to be desired tho. Bring your own if you are picky about your pillows. ~ The view I had... I was in the Oceanview tower and I wasn't facing the pool... I was facing the strip. So I had this great view of the Luxor, New York New York, MGM, Excalibur... it was nice. Things that left me wondering ""WTF?"": ~ The drainage issues, as mentioned in other reviews. ~ The batting in the comforter on the bed was all weird... it's like it was a duvet that wasn't properly attached or something. ~ The parking garage elevators. I swear, we thought we were going to die in those things by falling through the floor or something. All in all... it was a great trip. In fact, I would choose this place over the Sahara. The location is great. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The red flocked wallpaper--the leather banquettes--the way you feel like a Goodfella when you walk in through the kitchen--you know you're at Durant's! This is one of the bastions of Old Phoenix at its best--or maybe its worst, since a lot of the bad old days of corrupt city governance likely took place within Durant's walls. But since the staff is so discreet, we'll probably never know... Now to the food: I really like the food, the wines, the service. I've had prime rib here and it was great prime rib.

 Beautiful decor, super friendly staff, but it's a chain... Typical italian fare and a brunch menu, so we tried both. We had the french toast which is better at IHOP or any other breakfast joint.

 Good food, great drinks. I especially love walking in and seeing/hearing everything rock n roll around the place. The couple of times I've been here there has been very good service and no complaints about the food or anything. In fact, one time I went they were doing a special where you got a free frozen margarita (with Cabo Wabo tequila, the house favorite) with an entree order. This was during the summer, so I'm not sure when it will be back, if at all. I always order the Sopas con Carne (carnitas on corn cakes) and, when I'm feeling fancy, a margarita with Sammy Hagar's own Cabo Wabo tequila. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I don't like giving low star reviews but i'm sorry my experience here was very poor. The two stars are for the food but i would give five for the environment and decorations. When we first came in it was pretty crowded even for a wednesday night at 7:30. They had 2 or 3 open tables but they were too close to other people so we sat at the bar. There was no sign saying please wait to be seated or seat yourself and it appeared that the host was also the waiter and maybe even the cook. Once we sat at the bar a woman greeted us and provided us with menu and asked us what we would like to drink. I asked for a margarita and she said ""do you have tequila."" i didn't understand the question seeing that this was a bar and tequila is what is served in a margarita. Then she says that they don't have a liquor license but if i had brought my own they could prepare one for me. I was completely caught off guard especially since they have bar glasses that hang above their drink station and a whole rack of what are now empty wine bottles. Very misleading..BYOB is cool but don't have a bar look exactly like a bar then tell me you don't serve alcohol, what a rip! They even had one of those rubber drink mats that said Patron tequila on it so what the hell?? Any who, I asked for a virgin margarita that she said she could make and of course after 30 minutes she must have forgot because it never arrived at the table. I decided to just go with a water and one of the bottled mexican sodas, Jarritos. We ordered the avocado fries which was $8 so I assumed we would receive plenty. When the plate arrived it was a measly 6 slices of avocado with salsa evenly placed around a plate on a bed of lettuce. (see photo) I was like WTH is this. $8 for these little slices, It had to be only half of an actual avocado and the fact that i was splitting it with my sister made it even worse. After the app we looked over the menu which appeared to have alot of good choices. I chose the potato flautas and my sister order the curry goat. Each meal came with rice and beans, for mine it was mexican rice and hers was coconut rice. We waited about 15 minutes for our food to arrive and when it finally did boy did it look dry! The rice on both our plates was not moist at all and looked like it had been sitting wayyyy too long on the plate. My dish said it came with sour cream and lettuce which were both missing. I asked for the cream but she didn't even notice that the lettuce was missing. Before she brought my food she told me that they had run out of potato flautas so i said chicken was ok. Expecting chicken in my meal i bit into it and discovered that it was potato. I find it strange that you don't know what dish your serving your customers. The flautas were premade not in the store but probably from a box and they tossed large pieces of shredded cheese on top of the flautas which only partially melted so it just peeled off like dried elmers glue. Thy shell was way to thick and there was almost no potato inside. The beans were flavorless like they came straight out of the can and were just heated. The rice was ok but it also tasted like it came out of a box and had been sitting wayyyy too long. My sisters meal was nothing to rave about either. She ordered the curry goat which once it came to her table was very dry with no curry on it whatsoever. When you think of curry you think of a thai place that makes it like a sauce for your rice. I've had plenty of caribbean food and this curry was not what real curry was supposed to be. they should have said curry flavored instead of curry goat. When she asked for more sauce the waitress went to the kitchen and then returned saying that the curry is prepared with the dish so that there was no extra sauce on the side. WHAT??? How do you not have extra curry when it is essentially a sauce. I mean really people, it was like pulled pork without the BBQ sauce. (see pic) Her rice was dry and flavorless as well. Coconut rice is supposed to be sweet and a lil saucy but this stuff was like steamed white rice you get at a chinese spot. The only thing we ended up enjoying was the guacamole because it was very thick, creamy and had a little spice to it. Other than that all the rest of the food wasn't even worth my taste buds time. My hubby came late and ordered a burrito with marinated pork. they brought out the burrito but with no sauce. He opened it up to see what was inside and it was 90 percent rice and beans and a few spoons of pork shreds. It tasted alot better than our meal but the fact that it came out dry AGAIN just left me shaking my head. After we finished our meal I was ready to pay and go. Unfortunately my hubby was talked in to ordering dessert. I protested but he couldn't resist. he ordered the churros and my sis got one of their truffles. The churros looked great when they came out but they were overcooked. the truffles were nothing to rave about either. Everything was DRY DRY DRY..I won't be going back! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I always hear people raving about this place but I was not wowed. Oddly, I like most things on the menu but food was just ok. I really think Marathon's is over hyped. I've been here twice and ordered the chicken brochette plate, called ""chicken stick"" on their menu, for 11.45$ I found the chicken dry and chewy. It was like eating plain chicken breast. I've tried their pitas before and just not a fan of the tzatziki sauce. Overpowering, smelly. Rice is very good, and salad is alright - as another reviewer mentioned, its just iceberg lettuce. The bread basket they serve everyone is trying to pass off as garlic bread, but they use oil, not butter. It's gross. The best thing on my dish was the feta cheese, really. ",0,1,0,0,0

 On the way back to our hotel after dinner and saw a sign that said $3 dollar craps(only during certain hours, not the whole day) which is extremely hard to find on or near the strip. The westin isn't exactly on las vegas blvd so it might be a little hard to find but it's across the street from bally's and next to bill's gambling hall which is now being renovated. We decided to stop by and play. The casino is pretty small but I was okay with the size because it wasn't so busy. If you wanted to play bj, craps, or roulette you can just walk in and play w/o waiting which is pretty cool. A lot of people associate the westin as just a hotel and not a casino so maybe that's why it wasn't so busy. Anyways, the reason I give it two stars is because I had a problem with the crap's dealer in particular a woman. She was extremely unethical and misleading. She would try to look for newbies and take advantage of them. She would help them play and at the same time tell them to put a couple dollars down thinking it's a bet that you made but what she was really doing was making bets for herself. For example, if the button was on 8 she would say give me 4 dollars to put on hard 8, but what she did was put 2 dollars on hard 8 for you and she would put 2 dollars on hard 8 for her. When the button is off she would say give me 4 dollars to put on yo (11) she would put $2 dollars for you and put $2 for herself. She was doing this throughout the whole night to this couple. I play craps a lot so I know how to bet she tried to do the same to me but I caught her and moved away so she can stop hustling me and stealing my money to make bets for herself. She is a pretty attractive lady, she had an accent so I think she is from Europe or something. Watch out for her. She is very sneaky. You may think she is being nice and trying to help you make bets but really she is just making bets for herself. I played crap's at almost every major casino on the strip as well as the old strip and never has any dealer been this unethical and stealing money from people. I feel bad for the couple she took advantage of and all of the other customers she took advantage of. Hopefully, the pitt boss finds out what she is doing and has her stop. Out of the 4-5 dealers at the crap's table she was the only one asking money from people to place bets for herself/dealers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The scenery at the property was gorgeous. The service was beyond excellent throughout the property- at the lobby, pool, spa...etc. It's a nice resort with very down-to-earth employees. We really enjoyed our stay here. Our room was spacious. The only downside I can think of for our room was that because the door opens directly to the outside, bugs fly in when you go in/out especially at night. I got a few mosquito bites the first night. The spa was excellent and very relaxing. It was quite crowded on a Saturday though. With a spa treatment, we were able to use the facilities for an entire day. The spa had a restaurant, pool, workout rooms, salon, steam room, jacuzzi...etc. Everything was great. We walked out truly feeling pampered and relaxed after spending a full day at the spa. The main hotel pool (Jack Rabit) was nice and quiet. It was opened 24 hours. When it got really hot, the hotel staff brought pitchers of iced water to all of the hotel guests, along with bites of cut-up cold watermelons. The gym was awesome. The machines have touch-screens with TV and all controls for the machine on the same screen. The music mix was just right. The best was probably the cold washcloths kept in a mini-fridge inside the gym. The almost 4 mile loop trail that the hotel recommended for hiking brought us to incredible views. I highly recommend it early in the morning when the weather is cooler. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Great place to eat at the Phoenix airport. Don't eat here if you're in a rush, takes a while to get your order. Had the Brussels sprout salad; the sprouts are brined, so they were tasty and crunchy, lemon whole grain mustard vinaigrette, topped with cranberries, toasted almonds, currants and Manchego cheese - very tasty. The butternut squash soup was tasty as well, roasted with some sweet spices and thick and hearty. Their tortilla Chips are light and crunchy, great guac and a roasted tomato salsa. Other salads looked good, such as the baby kale. Hubby had the Caesar salad, dressing was very yellow, perhaps too much mustard, chicken was moist as seasoned well (smokey and grilled nicely).

 So we came to st Christopher's for a hen weekend. We were a group of 8 on two rooms of 4. We were on the 4th floor (no lift working- be prepared) and as we were a late booking we didn't have the luxury of choice. Our room was small and basic, 2 sets if bunk beds, 1 Mirror and 2 plug sockets. We unlike our other four friends had no on-suite, we had unisex shared toilets and showers (they get busy in the mornings). Breakfast is included and is available till 10am. It is a continental type breakfast and you can stock up on the basics, tea/coffee toast and cereal but you can order from the menu at a reduced price for staying at the hostel. They have a dinner and lunch menu but be prepared for a little wait during busy times. There is a bar that opens till 1am and every-night there is different entertainment, quizzes, live music, DJs etc... It is very centrally located and you can walk nearly anywhere. There are 2 clubs, one across the road and the other down the road. While staying at st Christopher's I recommend doing a ghost tour, visit the Edinburgh dungeons and take a ride in a rickshaw. Bus tours are a quick way to see the city and on purchase you get a free sundae at the hard rock cafe. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Was hoping for more out of The Pantry when we wandered in for a meal around noontime the other day. They were no longer serving breakfast, and we were informed that certain items on the lunch menu wouldn't be available until after 12:30. Left with a small selection of not-particularly-interesting choices, I opted for a cheese sandwich. Which was fine for a cheese sandwich, I suppose, but secretly I wanted to be eating something more exciting than a cheese sandwich. Service was friendly enough, and the outdoor seating area looks quite appealing. I'd go back for a coffee or maybe to give their breakfast a try, but I wouldn't bother with lunch there again - too many better choices in the neighborhood. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Lets just start by saying I love Nobu's Restaurants and that was the whole reason we chose to stay here, that being said the experience was terrible from the moment we arrived. The bellhop promised was busy, the check in staff was poorly trained and inattentive. Expecting epic room service forget it very slow and nothing special. Funny thing was I was having dinner one night at the restaurant and telling the waiter about the experience we were having and he said he would go over and try and fix it which he did. After he came back he stated he doesn't think they get it, in fact none of them have even come over to the restaurant for dinner to see what they should be living up to. Owe and I asked the concierge to if he could make me a dinner reservation at Nobu, he looked at me like what the hell are you asking me for, pointed to the restaurant and told me to go over there, I asked a second time and got the same response. Asked to speak to a manager that night, he came down was very rude, I told him I would just contact corporate the next day, he flipped out started yelling at me right in the lobby, refused to give his name when asked and stomped off telling me the general manager would contact me, she did 24 hours later, again no help and no service. Such a shame that what should have been a great experience was a complete let down. Last comment Nobu restaurant epic, Nobu hotel epic Failure! ",1,0,0,0,0

 This is not a pleasant review to write, because I've always enjoyed the Fireside lounge, and would go back there in a heartbeat when looking for a nice place to have a drink with friends. However, the Peppermill restaurant seems to have gone downhill since our last visit. The environment is still wonderful and intimate in its cheesy neon-y way, but something has happened to the food. Namely, it's no longer worth the price they're now asking for relatively simple fare. A basic plate of eggs and pancakes is over $10 now. Omelettes are around $13. Uh... what? $3 for coffee... very, very oily coffee. My chorizo and eggs featured overcooked scrambled eggs with very dried-out chorizo mixed in. The beans that came with them were right out of a can and heated for way too long, until they were cracked and dry. My wife's corn beef hash and eggs was runny, with canned hash underneath. It was greasy and not very good. Normally, I'd not be so disappointed by greasy or not well cooked breakfast food -- they're not called greasy spoons for nothing -- but for the price, the ire rises dramatically. It saddens me to say it, but if you're after great breakfast fare in Vegas, go for Blueberry Hill, or Hash House a go-go instead. You'll be much happier. Maybe we just got a bad line cook that day, but the impression is going to stick with us for quite a long time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 They'll try to cheat you, but bottom line ... I'll probably rent from them again. Saw the reviews here and was wary, but they're significantly cheaper than anyplace else, and the car was a new looking Hyundai and in very good condition. I was careful to explicitly ... and repeatedly decline all add-ons, yet was presented a contract that looked suspiciously more expensive than the estimated charges I'd previously printed out. Only then did I notice that ""James"" had 1) failed to return the printout I'd shown him and 2) he'd surreptitiously covered it with various other documents. They use scare tactics to convince you to pay for additional insurance, roadside assistance, etc. but be aware that your insurance for your own car usually covers you for rentals. Additionally, ""primary insurance"" coverage for vehicle rentals is provided gratis with some credit cards -- I use the Continental Airlines OnePass Plus MasterCard (Google it). I almost ranked them 1 star because of my experience with ""James"" at the counter. However, I got a decent car for cheap and my experience returning it was uneventful. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Arrived at 8:30 for Sat dinner and were given some great suggestions. There was a large family and like 2 other couples at the same time, and all were Indian so we thought it might be good after all. We started with Chili Pakoras, which are fried jalapenos, but spicy ones! The hostess even came out and wanted to make sure we understood what we ordered. Hubby had Lamb Curry, which was in a red spicy sauce-not intense, not bad considering I'm not a lamb eater. I had the Spinach Chicken which was very tasty and the spinach was just cooked right. We made one of our meals into a Thali, which is a big tray with several little samplings and we also had some bread that accompanies the main dish. We had a great time trying out this new food and thinking about recommending and going back. Total was about $30+, not bad for dinner for two on date night. Next time I'd like to try the mango dessert and a drink. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The staff is is not very professional. While seated on the upper balcony outside we kept noticing the waiters frequently congregating there. It seems they can hide from management there or something. They kept grouping up next to our table complaining about other guests and the other staff. At one point a young guy dressed in a black outfit (busboy maybe) came to our table and put two large dirty dishes from another table on our table. Then he proceeded to talk to us about nothing and interrupted our dinner conversation, while leaving someone else's dirty dishes right next to my girlfriend. It was rather gross to look at someone else's dirty plates while trying to enjoy an expensive meal. Lack of experience maybe? I don't know but unless the service level improves to match the food quality and prices, we will not be back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I wasn't impressed. All the hype was really for nothing. It reminded me of Town Square. Nothing special. We walked the entire mall in less than 30 minutes. The stores are small, everything is so crammed together. I rather stick to Fashion Show. ",0,1,0,0,0

 With the full restaurant and constant influx of people Saturday morning for breakfast, I expected this place to be a no doubter. Instead, what I got was uninspired, run-of-the-mill breakfast that failed to meet expectations. I got an omelette with chorizo, something that can't possibly be messed up, especially in the chorizo haven known as Champaign. They messed it up. The potatoes were soft and mushy, and even the toast seemed a bit off. To top it off, as soon as we got our meal, we were given our check. Nothing says ""get out of here so we can get more money"" quite like that. For your money and satisfaction, you're better off going to Urbana Garden or the like. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I love, love, love, love, love the Encore. The first time I went was soon after it opened and my boyfriend treated me to a romantic weekend (which turned into a week, but that's another story). We stayed in a regular suite as there were no rooms available in the Tower, and that was alright. Upon arrival we couldn't find a luggage valet to save our lives, which bothered me greatly, and check in was very slow, but the room was quite nice for a standard room. Very comfortable and I was expecting lots of red, as per the casino floor, but it was all very muted-chic. I wasn't so much a fan of the television mid-room; it was impossible for someone to sleep and the other to watch television without a snarl or two ;) A few days later we moved to the Tower suites (and have since never gone back to the regular suites, some 4 visits later). We stayed in a Parlor suite, and it is decadent - perhaps not quite to the extreme I was expecting (coming from Skylofts at MGM, nothing is quite as decadent as you'd hoped, I think) but gorgeous nonetheless. The suite is enormous, the bed soft and comfortable, everything very new and shiny. I LOVE the bathroom in the Parlor Suite - huge and gorgeous. I'm not a fan of their Bambu product line, but whatever, small things. Encore, as a whole, is over the top and very, very rich-feeling. This is my favorite casino in Vegas and although I hate to admit it we've gotten to know the craps dealers awfully well. Really great people who are lots of fun. Encore staff, I have found, are very personable. The decor is not for everyone, but I find it awfully inviting after coming from the dimly lit, dingy casinos elsewhere on the Strip. Love the personalized Red Cards (which are also your hotel room key). XS Nightclub - best club in Vegas. Pure is over. Sorry. Goes with the rest of the Encore theme - rich, decadent, over the top, and SO COOL. Service A+; I had a craving for a Bloody Mary and some poor barback went and fetched me one from the casino. Needless to say he got tipped awfully well at night's end. The Spa at Encore is INSANE... go see it, if only to look around. It's BEAUTIFUL, opulent, magnificent, astonishing. Easily my favorite spa in Vegas, with the exception of a Four Seasons Essence of the Glaciers facial (or whatever they call it). The services are wonderful, technicians well studied and professional, and there are beautiful pools and sitting areas in the spa. They have these amazing heated stone loungers near one of the small pools that invite you in and then put you to sleep. I've never been so comfortable in a public(ish) area before. Cannot wait to stay here again. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Everytime I come to Vegas I will go here for breakfast. It was that DELICIOUS. Their GREEK OMELETTE was one of the best omelettes I've ever had.

 Horrible! My family and I went here months ago and we were in the drive thru for about 20 minutes. They couldn't get my order right! They kept asking what my order was. Do I really have to tell you what my order was 6 times?! The staff was slow, unprofessional, and rude. Then we finally got our order and drove off.... turns out they still managed to screw it up. We got different flavors than we asked for. We were never given a receipt. I contacted Bahama Bucks online and she said the owner would be in contact with me shortly... months go by and I didn't hear from anyone so I messaged her again asking what the hold up was. This went on for about another month... Then I finally got an e-mail from the ""owner"" and I couldn't even make out half the email. His English is severely broken and he makes no sense. Then he said he would send me coupons and I was okay with that... Another month goes by and I didn't receive anything. Then I e-mailed him and he argued with me!! He said I need to come in to get them. I am 9 months pregnant and do not have the time or energy to drive 20 miles to get a coupon. Then he was asking if he could come over to my house! What?!?!?! SO UNPROFESSIONAL. I said no of course and then he said he would mail the coupon and I suggested he use a tracking number. I never heard back from him and here we are 2 weeks later still with no coupon or solution. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had! I will never return to any Bahama Bucks nor will my friends or family. This place is horrible and the owner is a jerk. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Came here for Christmas dinner finally after numerous trips to vegas and saying ""I want to go there!!"" Well I finally went and it was great food. We ordered the cheese plate for appetizer and it was to die for, especially with the fresh baked baguette that they kept brining to my table after we fell in love with it. We ordered the 22 oz bone in steak to share with garlic spinach and whipped cauliflower. OMG!!! it was better than mashed potatoes and was just the best fluffy, creamy goodness that I have ever tasted. The steak was cooked to perfection and the ambience was the best as well. I am a sucker for parisian ambience and this place is the place for it. I must say I was a little ticked off by the staff that help the waiters at the table... they were not the nicest people and just plopped and slided the plates on the table when they arrived, until I had to say something and they they all got nice....... interesting. Needless to say our waitress was fantastic and answered all our questions about the menu and made sure to check on us without being too overbearing. Apparently the hot ticket dinner item was the beef bourginione which I will have to order next time I am in vegas..... love that beef!!! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Waiter was friendly, however, that did not make up for the quality of food. First time in a CPK, was not thoroughly impressed with the food.

I would rate this place closer to 2.5 stars, just wasn't what I was expecting or looking for. Would probably pass the next time someone suggests California Pizza Kitchen.

 This is another one we found on Yelp Mobile. Sometimes you read short Yelp reviews and they don't help you at all. But Erika B.'s post on 11-5-09 couldn't have been on the money in describing Jason's Deli: ""I try to stay away from chains, but I went here with [family] and liked it ... The order line is kinda unorganized which made it a little confusing."" That was exactly our experience here, too. We escaped Red Rock and headed towards the Rampart-Charleston row of chain restaurants and retailers, maybe 10 blocks of regional and national eateries to choose from. Of the 30-40 choices, Jason's seemed a good lunch destination for the family. To add to Erika B's post, Jason's has a good selection of sandwich meat and hot lunch choices, and their French roll tasted fresh and was the right crispiness. The salad bar looked ok, and the dozen soup choices should please any palate. The half-sandwich/soup combo I ordered was a good lunch deal, with the chili I chose being slightly more watery than meaty, but still good. If you have the will-power to pass on the $2 drinks and sodas, you can do well here for your lunch money. ",0,0,0,1,0

 If you could give zero stars, this place would have earned it. Don't be fooled by the gourmet pricing...

If presented with no other options, do yourself a favor and eat the wad of cash instead. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I don't usually write reviews of places at all, but after using Yelp to pick this place as a place to meet up prior to a Diamondbacks game based on the largely positive reviews, I had to come back and let people know not to believe the hype on here. I am a lover of food and rarely find something that is just plain inedible, but that's what happened with every course of my meal at Coach & Willies. We started out with appetizers including meatballs, Italian nachos, and a wedge salad for the table. The meatballs were actually pretty good and my girlfriend also enjoyed her wedge salad. However, the Italian nachos were just plain disgusting. They reminded me of those cheap $1.50 Totino's pizzas that you can get in the freezer aisle at the grocery. The ""chips"" were mushy on the outside and hard as a brick on the inside; the toppings were clearly cheap and tasted awful. For my meal, I ordered the bourbon steak flat bread wrap. It was absolutely inedible. I was very hungry and was only able to force down two bites of the sandwich before calling it quits -- something that is unheard of for me. Altogether, I hope no one else makes the mistake of going to this place and expecting the good food that people here have written about. The menu is rather large and maybe that's why they are having a hard time keeping the food at a high quality. If you go here before a game, I'd recommend sticking to the beers and then getting a hot dog at the field. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The checkin system crazy. Don't mind a wait for a good place to eat, but being told to just hover around and check back every 20 minutes is interesting. Invest in the pager system. After hovering around the hostess station for about a half and hour we were seated. It took almost 10 minutes before our waiter acknowledged us. By this time we knew exactly what we wanted and just ordered at the same time we asked for water. Water took almost another 10 minutes and we then had to ask another bus boy? waiter? to get it for us. When another couple was seated in our area, I timed it from sit down to when he first approached them and it mirrored our experience. So this was obviously a very poor waiter who needs to either be re-trained or doing something else. The bread and butter to came out with meal. We ordered the burgers to try. They were good, but not anything to make me want to endure their check-in system and poor service for. We had eaten burgers at Mon Ami Gabi the day before and they were much better and we had A+ service. Not to mention the price at Mesa was no deal. I'll pay a lot for a good burger, but not when there is crappy service, forget it. Our waiter basically ignored us until near the end of our meal. Then he came back about every minute to try and ""be our friend"". I get that whole recency effect. He figures we will give him a tip based on that. Wrong. I would never come back to the Mesa Grill. With so many other great places to eat in Vegas with top-notch service, I would rather take my money and time there. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Typically when you go to a sea food restaurant you order a sea food platter. But I don't like sea food too much so I ordered a chicken dish. Maybe...no, definitely avoid their chicken. I highly doubt they are serving fresh chicken. It had a really weird texture, I can't explain it but trust me it was not quality. Plus it was the thinnest cut, half if it fatty and the bottom of it was over cooked so over all I had four bites worth at most. My daughter really enjoyed the crab legs and her broccoli, she didn't touch her Mac and cheese. My fianc \ u00e9 and my sister really liked their crab legs and lobster. FOR ME, the best part of dinning at this Red Lobster was their garlic biscuits, I love those tastey little rolls. The host was really nice, we were seated quickly, we were helped by a server (Linda) right away and she was very sweet. The food came out in good time as well and our drinks were refilled without having to ask. BIG FAT NEGATIVE... There were two flies hanging around our table, landing on the sides of our glasses and attempting to rest on our platted food. When I looked over at the big windows there was a few more flies hanging out on them. Very unappetizing to see. And honestly it made me wonder what their kitchen might be like....maybe I watch too many of those 'restaurant rescue' shows. ",0,1,0,0,0

 When it's scorching hot on the strip Crystals is an air conditioned connection between the elevated walkways that offers some eye candy as you speed walk through it. It's an oasis of sorts, a place to daydream of things you could blow money on if you ever won Mega Millions. As you look into the stores with service people waiting on no customers you can only imagine how attentive the service would be if you ever stepped foot inside a store or two. If you know where to look you can see the signs trumpeting the building's LEED environmental status. But then it hits you, unless you are filthy stinking rich this is not the place for you. You quicken your pace and head for the exit, pausing briefly to check out the cool small airplane hanging from the ceiling before you step outside to the strip, breathe in the exhaust fumes from Las Vegas Blvd and realize life outside of Crystals is better without much of the stuff they sell inside. Crystals is a textbook of example of just because you can doesn't mean you should. MGM Resorts plopped this ridiculous looking architectural abomination on prime strip front property as part of the biggest privately funded construction project in America to date. It's a temple to excess, bad design, and wasted square footage. Walk through it once, looky loo, and then go find something better to do. 2 stars: 1 because it's air conditioned, 1 for the entertainment value I got by watching 2 women come out of Prada, toss their shoes and slide on their new pricey ones only to say these really suck after a few steps. They ended up digging their old shoes out of the trash. It was a priceless Las Vegas memory for me. ",0,1,0,0,0

 For ramen and broth fanatics, this is literally as good as it gets. Always very busy, and there's a reason for it. PLEASE Cherryblossom, if you're listening, launch a location in OldTown. Cha Shu Ramen #1 must, however definitely go with the egg noodles in this one. Smoky, creamy broth will have you feening. Udon Suki Pot #2 must, they crack a raw egg on top to finish it off and the broth is so hot it cooks it. Deliciously flavorful beef broth. Spicy Gyoza Soup Appetizer #3 must. Must. Must. Must. Warning, it is actually extremely spicy, it will make your nose run. But I literally had a couple dreams about it, it was that good. I actually didn't like the champon noodles very much, but might be a personal preference. The tan-tan men noodles were very good as well. Sushi is decent.

 I am continually surprised by the rating style of yelpers who review in Champaign-Urbana. As I write this I see there is a review by M.H. that complains about personally seeing cockroaches and yet gives this place three stars (Yelp definition: ""A-OK"".) We must be in a region of low standards. What would it take to get two stars in this town? One star? Well someone has to stand up. So here is my two-star review. The courier features tired furnishings and an ambiance that varies greatly as you take steps away from the front door. Get seating in the back and you'll struggle to enjoy breakfast in a strange, windowless cave. The food is consistently mediocre. I particularly can't understand why they've chosen the highlights that they brag about. One is their ""special blend"" flavored coffee each day. I foolishly ordered this one. Undrinkable. That experience does technically fit the definition of ""special,"" but I think it's not what they were after. I know they're trying for quirky, and succeeding. The name comes from the space's previous use as a newspaper office. But what does that have to do with the weird but sort-of-cool airplane fan thing near the front door? And why is a tortilla and egg dish named ""rarebit""? Do they know what ""rarebit"" means? Does it have some meaning I don't know? I know that I sound like like a poop in the last paragraph but this is the kind of monologue in my head as I sit at the Courier Cafe. I sit, mystified, and work my way through a plate of undistinguished food. The one ray of light is that for some reason they sell the cut-up edges from pans of brownies in bags by the front register. They call these ""brownie bones."" There are two kinds of people in this world: the person that likes the squishy center part of the brownie and the person that only likes the crunchy edges. They aren't always available, but if you're the latter, I suggest you do stop the courier to buy a bag of crusts. Just don't stay for a meal. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This store has gotten better. I am sometimes tempted to head over to Home Depot, but in general this store is OK. Now, as far as why I gave them only two stars, here is where they really really drop the ball. They do not have an actual cashier in the evenings. They only have those self service machines which is four machines managed by 1 cashier. I get it Lowes, you make MORE $$ when you give less service. (At least that is what YOU think).

 Did an outstanding job on refinishing a set of OZ Superleggera's that had been neglected. The finish looks great and the machine cut faces really compliment the dark gray powder coat.

 I'll keep this short and straight to the point. I'm so dissapointed. I came in with a group of friends during the weekend. I asked for a basic mani-pedi. Payed 40$. The lady I had wasn't the most pleasent. While finishing my to coat she accidentally bumped a nail and instead of taking the polish off that finger and redoing it, she just put another topcoat over trying to cover it up. It was a glob of clear uneven nail polish on one finger... Clearly this isn't going to end well. I sat and let them all dry for over thirty min. As soon as I got in my car that nail was ruined, so I went back inside and had them fix it while they talked about me in Korean. All in all it was not worth it. My mani (even after they fixed the bad nail) only lasted one full day. My pedicure didn't even last a week. For a pedicure not to last at least a week is absurd in my opinion. I won't be back.

 Looks like a real old-school comedy club, very small, seating at tables, and a low stage with red velvet curtain. I didn't go when Brad Garrett was there, so we had a bunch of no name comedians who came up and preformed. Everyone who came up were really amateurs who jumped from joke to joke with no real momentum. They really overused curse words, which really watered down most of the jokes. Using the F-word really loud doesn't make for good comedy. I got two free tickets off MyVegas, so my 2 friends and I all split a third ticket for only $55. Went there on 2/13/13. My friends and I came a little late, so the host gave us a booth in the back, which was still pretty close as the place is pretty small. I just wanted a glass of water, but had to pay $6 for Fiji Water instead. I wouldn't really recommend going back to this comedy club unless your really drunk or just looking for a cheap show. It seemed like it was kind of a hit or miss place for comedians, but all of the people there my night were misses. If your going to go, get the two free tickets of MyVegas, drink a lot before you go, and don't have very high expectations. Can't really spend a whole night there, but it's something to do.

 I visited Charlotte and went to the Breakfast club with some locals. I was very impressed with the music, being a child of the 80s myself. That part was great. People watching there was a hoot! I mean, there HAD TO BE a Star Trek convention or a Bill Gates seminar somewhere in the area. I have NEVER seen so many dorks in my life! Maybe the cast of Revenge of the Nerds had a reunion? I'm not sure, but it was super funny! And NONE of them could dance. I laughed my ass off at all of them! I could have sold pocket protectors in the parking lot and made a fortune! As a happily married woman, in no way was I there to meet men, but woe to the girls who are trying to hook up! (Of course, the girls were a bit nerdy, too!) Oh, and the people who were in the least bit trendy and coordinated were gay! So, if NONE of that bothers you, you'll have a blast here! The Breakfast Club's motto ought to be ""Where the ugly go to get laid!"" LOL! I did have a good time there... Dancing to the 80s music was fun. People watching was fun! I would definitely go back!

 I read rave reviews about this place and it was 2 blocks from my hotel, so i had to check it out! The NY accent is definitely thick and abounds in there! The menu is huge!

I couldn't believe it as it existed my mouth... sigh. It was made fresh right in front of me, and i even had a choice for the wrap - wheat, spinach, tomato or something else... woah! There are cute tables out front, unfortunately a family of about 15 small children bogarted it for the entire time i was there. The light rail passes by and luckily is not very loud.

 I'm still trying to wrap my brain around what happened yesterday. This is technically my second time going to this event... the first time, I was with my girlfriend at the time. Neither of us could handle being there for more than a few minutes, so we got our entry fee refunded and ate at a Mexican food place nearby (which was pretty disgusting if I remember correctly). This year, I was determined to check it out. I went with a few friends, and we wisely decided to get drunk before going. The Scottsdale Culinary Festival is a misnomer... it's neither culinary, nor a festival. At least it's actually in Scottsdale. It's more like a parade of drunk douchebags. My friend spent the day giddily taking pictures of d-bag shirts and dumb hairstyles. It's very different seeing them outside of the clubs. The food here was a joke... mostly chain restaurants. There wasn't anything culinary about it aside from the fact it was food. This city has some amazing unique restaurants, and it seemed like the sampling at the event wasn't representational of the kinds of fantastic ""culinary"" experiences one can have here. There's nothing really festival about this either. It's definitely an event, but apart from security, port-a-pottys, ""beer gardens,"" and wrist bands - it's just some boring food and drink. My biggest problem with it is that you have to pay to get in, then you have to buy tickets so you can buy food and drink. They should just raise the price of admission, and have the food be free plus a drink ticket or two. I mean, this should be about restaurants showing off what they can do to get people interested in eating there. The vendors at these booths all paid to be here. People pay to get in, and I'm sure the promoter makes a portion of the overall ticket sales. Whoever runs this thing is probably making bank off it. It's a huge sham when you think about it. Red Bull paid a ton to be there and have a premium spot - they weren't even giving their drinks away (which they often do at events like this). Overall, it was a big joke - but we managed to have fun. It was interesting people-watching, but beyond that there wasn't any reason to come. If I had to do this totally sober, I would've been miserable. Edit: After browsing the other reviews, it seems like I didn't completely understand the event. I wasn't aware proceeds went to charities, and I didn't see a lot of the restaurants other people listed. I guess at an event like this, everyone is going to have a different experience. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The food was good; however I believe restaurants in Las Vegas have forgotten the meaning of customer service. We went in around 10:30am on a weekday because this place gets really busy during peak breakfast and lunch hours. We got our bill and put 2 cards for them to split the check. They ran both cards and included a note about check splitting, i.e. ""Dear check splitters, when we are slammed we will only take one card per table."" I found this note after-the-fact quite rude, especially since they were not slammed. I see that it's a small place so a quick turnover is necessary. Still, this was an absolutely rude way to enforce a no check splitting policy. The policy was posted nowhere prior to paying our bill, nor was the note there when they brought us the check. I find this to be a ridiculous policy as far as customer service goes, but what was the point of telling us AFTER they split the check. Was this meant to ""shame"" us? If they are trying to let us know for ""next"" time, no worries with the multitude of restaurants available in Las Vegas, neither one of us will ever go back, that was so rude. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Another location from my BEB 2013 journey! I hate Chocolate...Im just not a dessert kind of guy...especially anything chocolate. Id rather eat a fruity type of thing as a dessert. Im one of those guys who would rather save his stomach space for the main entree than consuming something sweet and sugary. So why am I giving a chocolate/dessert place 5 stars? This place made me a believer and lover of chocolate! Ever had that feeling or urge of wanting to convert someone to liking a certain something? (In my case it was chocolate). This place...geeze...where do I even begin? Let me put it this way: THIS PLACE HAS AWESOME CHOCOLATE! From the decor...to the presentation...to the creation...to the items placed in the freezer! Everything about this place was awesome! I was so against ordering something because I knew I didnt like dessert and that I didnt like chocolate. When the order came and I saw the presentation on the plate, my mind began be grow curious. Eventually, I had the weirdest urge and sensation and wanting to try it! So...I did. After one bite in...the doors were open and I was converted! If your ever in the area...and have any sort of appreciation for chocolate...or if your just looking for something sweet...this place is your jam! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! UNTIL THEN!! ^-^ ",0,0,0,0,1

 Come on now, advertised as all you can eat, then they hit you up for $6 for dessert. What a rip. The meat was overcooked, and the salad bar wasn't as good as they advertised. Total disappointment. Service was excellent. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Burrito with chorizo had far too much chorizo. I requested light chorizo yet it was so overloaded I couldn't see or taste the egg. Wondering why they say they will make it with light chorizo and yet they never do. I'd prefer you mention up front if there is no possibility in decreasing the amount used..... This prevents setting one up for disappointment. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I first discovered Thomas Pink a few years ago when I was graduating the first time around. It was expensive then, but that purchase is still in my wardrobe after being rediscovered, tags on (decided to wear a dress to graduation instead) when I was moving. I was in search of the perfect white shirt. I have few occasion's these days where I need to be suited and booted but it does happen. The prices are steep but you do get amazing quality shirts. I couldn't find the white shirt I wanted (I had something specific in mind and I couldn't justify spending \ u00a399 on the almost perfect shirt) but had I a different colour in mind then I would have been spoiled for choice. Thomas Pink still managed to part me from my cash as I found a gorgeous stripy shirt. If like me, you need the occasional formal shirt then the sale items are fab! My purchase was \ u00a379 originally and I paid \ u00a329 and will be great as a semi-formal or more casual piece. A great shop if you are looking for business wear that makes an impression and it is a great investment. I did look at the other shirt shops in George St, but to they weren't in the same class as Thomas Pink. ",0,0,0,1,0

 It's probably been 8 years since we last tried out the Garden Court Buffet. We had fond memories of it from previous visits. I don't know what has happened, but our breakfast buffet was extremely disappointing. It's one of the most inexpensive breakfast buffets you will find in Las Vegas. It's only $8. But even for that price, we wouldn't go back again. The coffee was the worst we've ever had. It was served in plastic mugs and was very watery. I could barely drink it. The orange juice was almost as bad. We tried a variety of items. We were disappointed with everything except the omelet, coconut donut, and cinnamon rolls. We arrived around 8:30 am on a weekday morning in early April and there was no line. When we left around 9:30, there was still no line. So, I think it's safe to say you won't have to wait to get into this breakfast buffet. Conclusion: If you have very low expectations, you might not be disappointed by this breakfast buffet. For the same price, we found the breakfast buffet at the Orleans to be better. Of all the buffets we went to during our 5-day stay, this was by far the worst. If you want an absolutely scrumptious dining experience, you must try the breakfast buffet at the Wynn or the Wicked Spoon. ",0,1,0,0,0

 What a terrible experience. Today was my first time eating at Boka Pizza as this is my first day working downtown. Darius took my order and was nice and inviting being a first time customer. When I opened my order once I got back to work I realized it was all wrong. I ordered the cheese steak and asked for no mushrooms on it. It was mainly loaded with veggies with a lot of mushrooms. I figured well at least I have onion ring I get to enjoy only to find out that they gave me fries which were mostly soggy and uncooked. I also got to the bottom of my root beer to find little hard black plastic like specks. I only noticed them after feeling them in my mouth and in my throat. I have no idea what they were and I generally would not gripe so much but the fact I paid $15.19 for a drink half sandwich and onions rings is outrageously stupid. Needless to say I will never go back there nor will I ever promote this place of business since they cannot read a receipt, listen to customers and have no level of cleanliness with the crap I found down in my drink. I think I will also be giving the health dept. a call since I don't know what I ingested. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My fellow Yelpers and coworkers have attracted my attention to Honey Salt, the husband and I have been wanting to try it since. Dinner started at 5pm so we arrived at that time, so we thought. The young but nice hostess informed us that we were 4 minutes early so we would have to wait to be seated. ummmm k. We had a drink at the ever welcoming bar (great 4 minute early service). 20 min later we re-approached the hostess who sat us, the place was still rather empty. Bread and bean dip- divine. Ceaser- to die for. Chicken- amazing, juicy and crispy....How? Salmon- came super raw- like seared on one side for a few seconds raw, I showed the waiter (super amazing guy) I figured that is how the chef prepared the salmon. He said no, that it was raw and took it back. No worries, I sipped my wine and enjoyed the great scene. The manager brought the salmon back (over $20 plate)- same piece and seriously black- they just threw the same salmon on the grill and cooked the heck out of it, like it was some backyard barbecue! Seeing how it looked like a cat got at it I told the manager this won't do, just cancel the order. He returned a short time later and said the chef was sorry, that he is making a new plate. The manager was so sweet I didn't want to argue, he said he just wanted me to leave happy. YAY for customer service. The second salmon was PERFECT- so yummy. Martinis are great too- Dessert was the BEST I have ever had (pumpkin cheesecake), like a delicious cloud in your mouth good. I can see how people don't agree with the price to food ratio- we left satisfied but not overfilled, we think it was because it was healthy food. Also, one yelper wrote about the tap water, I gotta agree, it has a weird taste! Drink the wine :) Although the night started out rocky (even the husband said ""lets leave and go to Vintners"") I have to say the awesome managers/waiter action in making it right said a lot, got the 4 stars, and got us to return again.

 Del Frisco's is outstanding. I came for 9 days and am staying near Del Friscos, in an area where there are also a half dozen other 4-star-plus yelp restaurants within a short walk. I've been trying a different one every night, and came back tonight for a 2nd visit to Del Frisco's. I got the Double Eagle Bone-In Ribeye both nights and it was perfect both nights. They have the biggest wine list I've seen in Vegas restaurants, and the wait-persons are prompt, efficient, and get everything right. I'm in town one more night this visit and am coming back for one more Bone-In Ribeye because it's better than any I'm able to get back home in San Diego. I am thoroughly delighted with the food and service at Del Frisco's and when I come back to Vegas in June, I'll be back to Del Frisco's again. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Nice to be able to see a movie for under $10. (adult: $8.50, senior: $6, child: $6, matinee: $6) It may not be as updated as the bigger, newer, glitzier theaters in the area, but we still enjoy going here, especially for a Sunday matinee. With 10 theaters, there's usually a decent movie selection. While I am not a frequenter of movie concession stands, it seems like they have all the basics. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Awesome, honest guy. Took my car in today because I thought I needed my brake pads replaced. He took a look at them with me there and let me know that it looked like I still had some life in them but he would put the car on the lift to check the brake pads on the inside. He confirmed that I still had a few thousand miles left in them and that it was safe to drive. Never had a mechanic not try to sell me on something. I appreciate him saving me the money for now. I will definitely be going back to him for all future needs. Word of advice, there is no sign out front and it's a one man shop so call first to set an appt if you can. ",0,0,0,0,1

 3.75 stars for Boardhouse Subs. I'm rounding it up to a 4. I've never been so conflicted when writing a review before. Usually I know when I leave the restaurant what kind of experience I had. I write a pretty fair review, I think, and consider all the factors. So I'm going to break it down and write a long review because of my own internal struggles. Because as I'm writing this, I haven't selected how many stars I'm giving it. I'm going to talk myself into a rating. I've got five categories I'll rate Boardhouse in. Service - Quick, friendly cashiers never rush you or make you feel like you're an idiot for asking questions. I've only had good things to say about them. In my recent visit I had purchased a deal from LivingSocial off my Iphone. It clearly states on the app that you can print the voucher or bring in your iphone (same way Groupon works). The cashier struggled with this concept, nervous to accept anything but a printout. She balked and nearly refused me use of the credit. She ended up accepting it - good thing she did, because I would have turned around and left... and not batted an eyelash at giving them a one star rating. You simply do not allow your business to be on LivingSocial and not accept a paid-for voucher. But she accepted it after a few moments of hemming and hawing. Good for her. Quality - On the sandwich scale, about a four (out of five). MUCH better quality than Subway, or even Port of Subs. Not as good as say, Capriotti's or other specialty delis. Equally as good as some of the other 4 star sandwich shops on yelp. The turkey is roasted, sliced thick, breads are yummy, condiments fresh, etc. Price - Okay, they're overpriced. Even expensive. We picked out two bottled sodas, two bags of chips, and two whole sandwiches (you can choose whole or half portions). He got ""The Original"" with turkey and roast beef (extra charge), normal veggies, and cheese (extra charge). I got the Chicken Bruschetta. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals, but before the voucher it came to $24 something. UM, WHAT? We could eat out at a medoicre family restaurant for that. However, last time I was in Port of Subs I remember paying almost nearly this much and I wasn't as impressed... hmmm... Atmosphere - Adorable, cute little corner shop next to Albertsons. Cute decor, easy to read menu. Frequented by firemen, police, and other blue collar workers. I like this place. Clean, inviting, certainly a place I feel comfortable in. Return Business - Would I come back? If I was craving a really good hot sandwich, yes. I might gravitate more toward Heidi's Brooklyn Deli on a daily basis because of their price difference... but I'd come back here for a Chicken Bruschetta. With the deal we purchased from LS - hell yes. Added Bonuses: *** Kids Menu: Hooray for family-friendly! Three low-priced items on their kids menu. *** Frozen, chocolate covered bananas. *** Great bottled drink selection with fountain drink option. Okay, talked myself into 4 stars. ",0,0,0,1,0

 It's Overrated! Plain and simple! The reason it's famous is that it offers aspects that most Phoenix restaurants lack: (1) It's not a chain (2) It has hip swanky northern California feel as it is next to a wine bar. It didn't hurt that Jerry Colangelo would publicly recommend this place for a date and soon it just became a hit. It was a trendier option to the usual bar food right before a Suns game. That's how it got famouse. People would park and dine here early before Diamondback and Suns games and then walk to the game afterwards. However, when the #1 ranking came out, it just drove this place through the roof. The food hasn't changed. Yes, they make great pizza but like another reviewer mentioned, i can think of at least 5 places in Phoenix that offer better pizza. Is it worth the wait...most certainly not. It's just annoying now because any out-of-town guest wants to dine here and taste the ""best pizza in America"" and they are always let down. ",0,0,1,0,0

 A little disappointing overall. We tried to book a reservation on the weekend, but this place is full. On a weekday evening was much easier. So it must be good. The waiter was really nice, but maybe trying too hard. There's waiters who you can tell are actually funny and having a good time, and others who sound like their first night on stage at a comedy club - complete bomb. anyways, we ordered the new york steak, salmon, and veal. everything was drenched in olive oil. i'm sure it was a high quality evoo, but everything pretty much tasted the same - olive oil with tomatoes and capers. the new york steak was by far the best dish. A good cut of beef. veal was okay, and the salmon with crispy skin would have been good had it not been of the overly sour tomato sauce and overabundance of capers (or whatever those were). Maybe we just ordered the wrong items, but we not not impressed with Rao's at all in terms of food. Being in Vegas and at Caesars, we knew what the price tag was going to be. So ""value"" didn't even figure into the 2 star rating. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Everything is so...relaxed at Tahiti Village. Sure, there's a rec room, a gym, a spa, and even a lazy river on site, but its location off the strip makes it feel like a serene resort than a happening place (not a bad thing, mind you). Of course, the shuttle that goes to New York, New York and The Mirage makes it easy to get to the action. We hit a hiccup when we first got into our room, with a missing couch cushion and some stains on the carpet. However, management was completely understanding and gave us a different room at no charge. It's a different experience, but it's still worthwhile. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The food here is excellent, but the service is even better! Came here with my coworkers before a performance at Symphony Hall. We had such a great waitress--Audrey. She was so attentive to our table, helpful in picking our meals and not overbearing or trying to take our plates before we were finished. For our appetizers, we got the yelp deal for the free chicken lettuce wraps--omg, those were to die for! The dried fruit and almonds gave them a sweet AND savory taste. My coworker got the garlic/spicy hummus combo, SO delish, too! For my meal, I had the pistachio pesto caesar salad and absolutely loved it...perfect portion, filling and very tasty. Will definitely come back to this spot! So glad we had Audrey as a waitress!! :) ",0,0,0,0,1

 I didn't want to take a cab because: 1. I was traveling alone. 2. Paying a ridiculous cab fare. Then I remembered the airport offered shuttle services to hotels. With the help of my Yelp app, I was able to do business with Super Shuttle Las Vegas. For $8, I shared a van with other travelers that were going to the same hotel I was. The driver informed us of delays due to road work around the airport. With a positive experience with the van ride, I decided to use the service again for my departure out of Las Vegas. I called to schedule a pick up from my hotel and paid my fare via phone. I just had to pay $8 plus a fee of $2. Still a great deal than a cab. A shuttle came 15 minutes earlier than what I was quoted. Thank goodness for that since I didn't have to worry about traffic at the airport. The drivers I had were great and friendly. Service overall was professional and helpful. I most definitely would recommend Super Shuttle Las Vegas. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Saw all the great reviews on Yelp and had to try this place. We were very happy we did! So close to home and love the neighborhood pizzeria feel. Ordered a large pizza with pepperoni & sausage and garlic, 3 cheese Stromboli and garlic knots....OMG the garlic knots!!! They were fluffy pillows of buttery, garlicky goodness that not only smelled good but made our mouths water as their wonderful aroma filled the air around us. The pizza was BETTER than the NYC pizza I had in NYC and made me feel good knowing I don't have to travel 3000 miles to get amazing pizza. The crust was thin, crisp and chewy, sauce was perfect, cheese is good quality and toppings very generous. We will definitely be back and spread the word. Thanks to Yelp we saved 50% off our pizza order just for checking in today between 2-5pm. ",0,0,0,1,0

 T. Cook's and I have a long history but T. doesn't know it. The first time I met him was over ten years ago when I was just making it in this town. I had reached my goal for my office and in celebration, I took some of my friends and biggest cheerleaders there to celebrate. T's food went right to my g-spot and I had an orgasmic reaction right there at the table. I saved T for special occassions. The next time I went was again for some celebratory occassion with some friends and once again, T's food went right to my g-spot and I had another orgasmic reaction. The third time, I've been spoiled so I was secretly rubbing my legs together under their pristine table linen in anticipation and didn't care who saw me as I licked every delectable morsel off of my plate and fingers, groaning with pleasure. With gloating praise of T., I got a group of friends together for a private dining experience at the Delano Room (min. $500 spending) for a holiday dinner this past Christmas. When making the reservation, the lady was a bit snubby which I can accept when I am anticipating another orgasmic experience. We gather for a evening of fine dining . . . except this time, T. had performance anxiety and failed me. First the waitress looked like she was overworked and coming into the Delano Room was an inconvinence to her because she has just way too many tables outside that were more important to her. When my dish came, it had been under the heat lamp for so long that it was completely shriveled that I could not tell what dish I had ordered. I gave her one look and without a word, she took the dish back and asked me if I would like to order another dish. Where my g-spot was left high and dry was when we got the bill, the antipasto dish that the waitress had recommended we ordered as a 3-person portion was a whopping $45 per plate. She had said that ""some"" additional amount would be added for a larger portion- she neglected to clarify that it would be a whopping 3x's the amount. And we had 2 plates of those . . . $90 for 2 antipasto plates?? So what was supposed to be my most savory experience with T. was completely anticlimatic and totally blemished my memory of him. I know T's popular so he'll have many suitors- just not this one. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Mandarian Oriental was a lovely experience. I'm aware that some people actually live in this building and I swear if you stayed there and didn't look out your window. You would feel like you were at home. When they say they concentrate on customer service, they mean business. Everyone there was attentive and smiley. Checking it was a breeze and they offer warm towels to welcome you in. On top of that , they actually take the time to walk you to the elevator on your first visit. It's a simple yet very kind gesture. Free tea and coffee are available for you( only earlier in the morning though) and sometimes they have a server go to your room to ask if you'd like any cocktails. Not a huge fan of this though. If I needed cocktails /room service I would probably just call for it. but thanks anyways! The pool is a medium size area where you will certainly get a ton of sun. Not just because you're in the desert but because neighboring buildings tend to reflect the heat even more. Quick fix if you can't take the heat? slip into the pool that is never too cold or too hot. My experience here has been great. However, the price is pretty high so look out for deals because we got a great deal on travel zoo which was around $150 instead of their high average rate. On another good note, where else on the strip do you find workers there that say, ""welcome home"" before you walk back into the building? ",0,0,0,1,0

 Read about this place on Yelp Monday and dropped by the next day to try it out! The baos were delicious, tender in the dough and crispy in the skin (for those of you who avoid the skins for health reasons, they only put one piece of it on there to give the bao some crunchiness). More meat was in the chicken than the duck, but both were fantastic and well worth the wait! The seasoning isn't overpowering and all the ingredients complement each other (I especially enjoyed the cilantro). As I found out first hand in person as well as on Yelp, you are discouraged from taking your food to go unless you live close by to the establishment. At first I asked to take it to go because it seemed like there was no where to sit, but Jenny talked me into sitting at the bar. I wasn't in a hurry to go anywhere and I figured, why not. The food is less likely to get soggy and it won't be necessary to reheat it. I highly recommend ordering the combao- trust me you won't regret it! Because if you order just one, you'll be like me and wish you had ordered it upfront. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This can be a pretty much all-inclusive hotel/casino in Las Vegas. You have the top LV restaurants all here, the largest casino floor in town, Ka runs here, and there are lots of places to get your drink and dance on. We stayed in both the West Wing and the regular rooms during our stay, and I preferred the regular rooms. Check-in and out here is pretty much a breeze, the rooms are very well kept and laid out, and again, the restaurants here are incredible. I thought the gaming selection was also good, and they have a really nice poker room to boot. I think this is one of the top tier 2 hotels in Las Vegas...you get much more for your $ than comparably priced tier 2 hotels in Las Vegas like TI, Monte Carlo, Paris, Mirage, etc... ",0,0,0,1,0

 I drank the biking kool-aid this summer and bought my first USA made canondale from Budget's Used shop on Regent Street and have since picked up two more USA made Cannondales. One of them was a 2007 bike with a Lefty shock on it that wasn't working correctly so I dropped it off at this new shop. I didn't realize just how new they were, but I'm glad I found them! Their building is GORGEOUS...being in the architecture industry myself, they restored this building beautifully which creates such a unique atmosphere in the shop. It's neat to see such historic architecture housing some of the latest beautifully engineered bikes! Their mechanical shop staff was helpful and very willing to educate me as I'd never owned a bike with this type of suspension...I love to be able to walk out knowing more than I did when I went in. Overall I I had the bike tuned (which included straightening my rear wheel and rear disk brake), hydraulic brake bled, and new front brake pads put on for a reasonable $120! I will definitely be back and if you're looking for helpful and knowledgeable staff when looking for your next Cannondale or Bianchi...this is the place to go!!!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Chicken schwarma: dripping with sauce, chicken so dry it crumbles apart, definitely the worst part of the meal. According to the roommate it smelled like ""a dogs a$$"" Lamb gyro: mediocre at best. At least this one didn't require you to have a big gulp to assist in the chewing process. Kibbeh: not sure how long that was hanging around on the hot line, regret that one too. Dolmas (grape leaves) : best of the worst but really how hard are these to mess up? Came in around 8pm, ordered the above food from the woman at the counter, 10 minutes in and out. When we asked her if she would split the cost between two cards she said we don't want to but we will. That's always a killer thing to hear when you first visit a restaurant. She then proceeded to tell us it's because they charge them for each card, yes I know, if it had been separate orders you would still get charged for both. If this is the quality of food being put out an hour before closing you might as well close at 8.This place had bad customer service on top of bad food, I'm not even sure how everyone else is eating in the same restaurant. I'm still hoping Yelp will come up with some type of blackout button so that I would have the option to have this never show up in my searches again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 NO SERVICE, NO SALSA, NO SMILE We had walked by several times and finally decided to stop one night when the music wasn't so loud and the bar wasn't packed. We didn't want to fight for a table so it was a good time, late at night. All we wanted was chips and salsa. We sat at the bar but quickly grew impatient as we weren't noticed. Once we finally received our menus the bartender had left to do something. I forget what they were asking for the chips and salsa but we'd been told it was just one salsa, (no ""hot"" option; no ""verde"" option) so for whatever the price was we didn't think it was worth it and ended up walking out. Didn't even get a goodbye. Note: We did however have a great time another night taking pictures on the four stools as you enter. Fun stuff! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I had VERY low expectations when I went... and was pleasantly surprised by how mildly entertaining the overall Chippendales experience was. A fun night with copious amounts of strong alcohol and lots of HOT gay [sorry to break it to you girls, but straight men just a.) don't move their hips that well and b.) keep their bodies so toned and well-oiled] men parading around in sexy tight outfits? FANTASTIC! We had seats in the front row, dead center.. which meant I was in the ""target zone"" and got 4 lap dances and a few kisses. I should've been excited.... but nope. I was honestly more thrilled by the expression on my best friend's face, her periodic blushing as she gushed about how hot they all were, and the fact that as soon as it was over, she said, ""Do we have time to come back here before we head to San Francisco?"" We didn't, sadly. But I know now where to take my girlfriends the next time we plan a trip to Las Vegas. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This hotel is very affordable so it is perfect for college students or people traveling on a low budget. The room is very spacious which is a plus. However, it was a non-smoker room and smelt like people have recently been smoking in there. The carpet is really dirty (and at some places wet for no reason) so I would not suggest walking there barefoot at all. The room is also very dusty. I always woke up with tearing eyes and a congested nose. The bathroom was big and clean, so were the towels. The room didn't have a fridge or minibar (in case you are thinking to bring some food, it will go bad). We also always had problems to get into our room as our keys didn't work well and we had to go get new keys a few times. Furthermore, the check-in took forever as there was a long line and only a few ppl working. Every time I passed the lobby there was always a long line. My check-in took me over half an hour. Overall the hotel is nice as it has lots to offer. Many little stores, restaurant inside. It also has roller coasters inside as well as free trapez shows. It is also kinda far off the main part of Las Vegas Blvd which was annoying as you have to walk a lot. However, if you simply look for a cheap and safe place to stay in Vegas and not too far away from the strip, this is a good place to be. If you look for something more comfortable I suggest you To take a different hotel. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I would have given it 3 stars. While their selection isn't huge, its offerings were enough since I was starving and would have eaten anything. The sushi was surprisingly fresh and decent. The stir fry veggies and noddles were tasty. Their American bbq section...the tri-tip= not so great, okay mac&cheese, weak greens and decent yams. Yummy salad bar, but they prepare it for you. And the dessert bar? My favorite part of the meal. They had a great selection of mini desserts. The creme brulee, fruit tart, chocolate covered strawberries and banana donuts were all yummy. Although some of my food didn't taste that great- it wasn't horrible, I was fine there leaving with a full stomach. But not even a couple hours laters, my tummy started hurting and I was hoping it'd go away as we had got to our seats for the Love show. Sadly, my stomach got worse and I had no other choice than to go poop in a public bathroom. I NEVER go #2 in a public bano! That's just not cool. But my stomach was killing me and thankfully, I was able to relieve myself with plenty of time before the show started. Because of my bad tummy ache, and not being able to pinpoint what brought it on, I will say that visiting The Buffet at TI in the future will not be on my list. :( ",0,1,0,0,0

 If I wanted a sleezy salesman, I would have gone to a used car lot. But that's what I get for getting my first detail and not doing research. 200 dollars for a detail and buffing out scratches (that didn't need to be buffed out, because they are clearly still visible) I told the guy, Trip (after he upsold me on an unnecessary added extra), I could not wait a couple hours and that I would just have to come back another time. He said he could get it done in an hour and a half. Well, he must've actually meant 4 hours, because that is how long it took. The extra star is for the front desk, they were very understanding and empathetic to the situation. Definitely irritated enough not to go back though. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I really liked this hotel - a friend of mine booked a suite with attached room for our super bowl weekend. It included jacuzzi tub, full kitchen, living room with an 8ft projector, and views of the strip! Our super bowl party in the room was so much fun with the TVs and projector - not to mention very affordable (compare to $200/head for strip super bowl party). The annual girls only Vegas trip I'll be planning will most likely include a stay here! Rating would have been 5 except there was confusion at check-in at the fault of the hotel reservation system.

 + Awesome service + delicious steak + thin crispy shoe string fries + super fluffy cinnamon sugar donuts + heirloom tomato salad with basil - YUM + border crosser (shot of tequila + beer) Came here with friends in hopes of delicious delicious meat. They change their menus so what we were hoping to get was no longer on the menu, sigh. However, the manager came buy and said if we ever call in a day before hand they'll be sure to make it for us - score. Our group ended up ordering various steaks topped with eggs and frites, and I ordered the lobster pasta. Everything was delicious and freshly made. But my favorite was the donuts, seriously something about that light and fluffy dough coated in cinnamon sugar. Plus it comes with 3 dipping sauces (chocolate, caramel, berry compote) OMG.

 We came here on Labor Day at 12am and waited for 2 hours. The waitress said it would take 3 hours but we still didn't mind. There were about 10 parties ahead of us. Also, I didn't know this place was actually a BAR. It's surrounded by the slot machines and there are no tables. So everyone is sitting at the bar facing the cook and waitress. Oyster (half dozen) - $12. So fresh! They shuck the oysters to order and I saw them throw away oysters that aren't Oyster Bar approved. So it's nice to see that they care about the quality of their food. We were debating on getting the dozen since it was only $6 more. I regret not getting the dozen. Combo Pan Roast - $23. My husband and I shared and it was a perfect portion for us. The cook gave us 2 bowls of rice and didn't charge a split plate fee, which we thought they would. I think they just gave us less rice each. The shrimp was so great. It was not overcooked and just the way I liked it...a bit undercooked. The crab was shredded in the sauce which I don't prefer but it was still good and the lobster were in chunks. Service - Our waitress was so kind and fast! I forgot her name but she kept moving and serving everyone. I also saw the cook go around the bar to clean the table. I thought that was cool since you don't ever see that! Definitely a team oriented restaurant. The cook also joked around with us that they ran out of oysters. I'm from southern california and this reminded me of The Boiler in Chino Hills. Oyster Bar is a great find but it didn't amaze me as much as I had hoped. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Least favorite hotel in Vegas (Cosmo, Mirage, Encore). Unbeatable rates (i.e.: $69/room) if you need a deal but off the Strip location makes Hard Rock rather inconvenient. Loud, smoky lobby/bar. Would be fine to come party here but not to stay. Casino Tower - AVOID. Co-worker had a plumbing disaster, which flooded his bathroom. Another co-worker was prematurely checked out by accident, ALL her belongings were MOVED TO LOST AND FOUND, she was room-less until 4am on a Thursday. Unacceptable. Was originally checked into a smoking room in Paradise Tower despite clearly requesting non-smoking on my original reservation. Staff swiftly upgraded to HRH Suites. HRH Suites is nice and quiet. Stunning bathroom with smoked glass doors, fantastic lighting controls. Living room furniture appeared a bit worn, unfortunately. Bedroom suite doors essentially soundproof the bedroom, which is awesome. Has separate entrance, which is very convenient for hailing cabs. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Mmmmmm. So good. They start you off with salt and vinegar popcorn. What. Right? Yum! I had the Rising Sun burger, I believe it was Kobe beef patty with deep fries avocado, teriyaki sauce, furikake maybe...don't quite remember. But it was yummy! They had a couple of others ones I wanted to try also but my belly couldn't handle all that food. I also had a dreamy cookies and cream milkshake (alcoholic) - portions for the shakes are pretty big. The art in this place is so cute too haha. Animated cows dressed as pigs doing random things. Would probably come back to try the beers and the pork belly buns. Yas. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We were looking for a place to satisfy my husband's giant-sized hunger and my need for a good drink. The atmosphere in this place is relaxed and we enjoyed the Hawaiian/island themed decor. I ordered a Big Ass Bloody Mary and it didn't disappoint. My husband got his vodka and cran. The menu had a good variety to chose from and they served breakfast all day! We were in the mood for lunch and my husband got the Kobe burger and opted for the fried egg on top! My mahi tuna teriyaki sandwich was also tasty but very messy. Service was good and it wasn't very crowded and we felt like they just let us be and relax which was also nice. I would like to go back and try more options next time we are in Vegas.

 Wow! Keep in mind that this is two stars AFTER the fact that we got in for free, without waiting, sat in a super nice booth enclosed in glass, elevated above the dance floor with free top shelf drinks. Also keep in mind that this review is written for who I think is the average Yelper. By that I am assuming that you do not visit Las Vegas on a normal basis, and are looking for the best spots to make the most of your trip (like me). The Good: - Go go dancers that smile, are great dancers, and in great shape. They even climb up the pole with plastic umbrellas. - Great DJ, good music -Being the newest club in town means...it's new. Everything is new and shiny. I like shiny things. The Bad: -Bathrooms lines were stupid long. -Super small club. -Even in the VIP lounge there wasn't much room to dance. Looking around there were people dancing on ledges everywhere. You could not move in the dance floor. -The VIP hostesses are beautiful. But beauty doesn't give you the right to glare at me when I politely decline a drink they shove at me. Also, unless you are a man, they won't even make eye contact with you. The Ugly: -The bouncers are super rude unless you know somebody. Even then, some still have a snooty attitude. The Disgusting: -Not the fault of the club, but a great reflection of their clientele. I'm behind my girlfriend (who is white) and walking towards the VIP lounge from the bathroom and heard this ugly, nasally, voice screech out as loud as she could ""What the F*ck is up with all these stupid Asians?!"" My friend is passing her as she screams this and I am now face to face with her. She stares at me and looks terrified. If I wasn't invited into the VIP booth as a guest, I truly would have made a scene, but I just laughed at her. The Verdict: I would not pay to come in here. In fact, if somebody else paid, I still would not come back. I thought America was past racism, but I was wrong. ",0,1,0,0,0

Korean kalbi (short ribs) were CHEWY too tough for me !!! Watch out if you have dentures. Chicken wings in small pot was cute & good Smoked salmon- too salty But the salmon with mandarin orange on top was good. Sushi rolls- call it rice rolls not much fish Watch out for Berry platter. A lot of squash berries plus some had molds.... Yuck!!! As for dessert, they had a good selection of gelato. I enjoyed my pistachio but not the best.

 Been there twice! Both times the food was good. Nothing to write home about but decently good. The reason for the 2 stars...the service! Wow! Talk about horrible service. The first time we went we sat for about 20 mins without our server even approaching our table. We finally had to flag him down and ask him if we can put our order in. The rest of the visit was more of the same. Us sitting and constantly flagging the server down for things we needed cause he never stop by on his own. 2nd visit was more of the same...had to ask multiple times for anything we wanted. Had to flag server down cause he never stop by our table. My cousin had time to walk to CVS and back before the server came to our table and take our order. I don't think I will go back.

 The toong tong was a decent appetizer and the pad ke-mao was a good entree, but the pak rad kang (with chicken added) was a disappointment. All in all, the food was fine. Not special, but not terrible either. This rating would've been higher--that is, 3 or even 4 stars--had the service come a little closer to living up to the hype in other reviews. As it was, we had a 7pm reservation and were seated promptly upon arrival, but no one came to our table for a full 20-25 minutes after being seated, despite several tables sitting empty (and uncleaned) around us. Had the place been full, it would've been more understandable. But it was kind of ridiculous how good they were at ignoring us as we pleaded nonverbally for at least a strong beverage to pass the time.

 I went there during hockey night, the place was really packed. Although since it is not strictly a sports bar, they do say that every CH game is played there on TV. Given my past experiences with other 3 Brasseurs, I was really amazed by the service, our waitress was very caring and the service was personal. The Onion Rings was a total rip off, if I were to pay 8$ for merely 6 onion rings, they better be plated in gold, soaked with unicorn blood and deep-fried in Lambda olive oil. It tasted nice, but still, onion rings aren't haute cuisine. The Smoke Meat Poutine was really tasty, the gravy was just on point and generously poured over their amazing fries. The Sandwich Euro lacked lots of seasoning, and the mayo was not evenly spread. We waited for almost 15 minutes until our orders were taken, but it happens during a crowded evening. ",0,0,1,0,0

 i don't mean to sound like a whinging yank, but these bagels kinda suck. i understand that i am not in new york city so i'll be generous and give them 2 stars since it was nice to find a bagel at all so far from home. if you think i'm being harsh, just imagine you're from here in scotland and you go to america and order some haggis. how many stars do you think it would rate? well enough from me... i'll quote the first to review this place, hillary r.: ""if i had never lived in nyc and eaten bagels daily i wouldnt be so immensely unhappy with the bagels here. actually, even if i had never had a bagel ever, i would still not be impressed with the bagels here. theyre a step up from lenders bagels from the grocery store but a step down from the lowly brueggers bagels. but they do have some pretty tasty sandwich meat/item/condiment ideas. too bad they overcharge the fuck out of any of them."" i'll add that their cream cheese was really not good at all. the best part of this place were the cunningly cute customer drawings of elephants that adorned the walls. it may have been pachyderm paradise but it was far from bagel bliss.

 Not all that good, unless you're drunk and cutting the rug, I guess. My wife and I stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and it was a decent-sized crowd enjoying the nice weather. I perked up when the server told me it was happy hour. However, this is the lamest happy hour I've ever seen or heard of. $3 domestic bottles? What kind of happy hour is that? Who is charging more than $3 for a bottle of Bud Light even at the worst of times? And of course, I go through the normal shenanigans with the server as I ask for other bottles that are made in the US but somehow aren't included in the special. Fat Tire, etc. These are domestic, but no, you can't have them for $3. I order the carne asade tacos: $10, no rice or beans. No chips on the table. The meat is very sparse, and the rest of the taco is mushy stewed tomato. The tortillas are mushy as well, and there is a sad sprinkling of lettuce in the middle of the plate that would barely be sufficient for one taco, let alone the three that are on the plate. I took 2 bites and sent it back. My wife had a chimichanga which was OK. And by OK, I mean it's on par with what you might buy in the freezer at Safeway. On the plus side, the server was really nice.

 Awesome local spot without the hipster pretentious attitude. The beans are amazing - I usually keep their in house Titus beans stocked at my house.

 It means more to me than anything to see a Japanese person succeed in America. It's very difficult to run a small business. The hardships you must endure to barely allow your business to just merely survive one more month are indescribable. I'm not going to make this a detailed argument about politics, but whenever a democrat is in office, small business(most particularly Asian owned business) will struggle. There is a misconception that if you own a business that you are ""rich"". In reality the owners of these establishments put their life savings on the line to buy these small stores. They cannot afford to hire workers, or pay workers comp insurance, etc. Everyone in the family works over 12 hours a day to barely allow the business to break even. As a 4th generation Asian-American, no one supports small business more than I do. I would prefer to shop here any day over mega Asian markets such as Greenland, 168, and Seafood City. Mini Mart Japan is a great resource here in LV. They have just about everything you need when it comes to making basic Japanese food at home. They have a great selection of Japanese candies, and candy from other Asian countries that are popular in Japan. Also, they have DVDs of current television shows in Japan that are impossible to find online. I come here for that Special Instant Ramen that tastes almost like what you find at your favorite Ramen-Ya. Also, I like to stock up on Green Tea and Mochi Kit Kats!! Japanese products have a very quick expiration date. For example, we can buy Kit Kats at any convenient store or Wal-Mart, but when you open the package the Kit Kat will taste hard, stale, and have that white chalky stuff all over it. A Kit Kat from Japan will never be like that. It will be moist, fresh, and full of flavor. It features no chemical preservatives, but may have a shorter self life. That's why you will have to pay extra, but to me it is far worth the extra dollar. I know that many of you FOB Asians and 2nd generation Asian-Americans don't understand my point of view when it comes to supporting other Asians in America. I read your Yelp reviews and see how you bash other Asian owned businesses and give harsh bullying reviews. In the last decade, I've seen the Asian community in America become very disconnected and spiteful of each other. Everyone wants to be ""white"" now, and no one supports each other. Asian-Americans are indeed the highest economic earning group in America. No other race makes more money than us according to ALL studies. Do you know how we got to that place? Because a long time ago we used to support each other, and help each other succeed. So, let's keep it that way. Let's remain on top of the food chain here in America. Instead of condemning businesses like this for being ""too small"" and ""not fancy"", lets band together again like old times. I encourage all Japanese-Americans in LV to support businesses like JAPAN MINI MART, and other small business in LV. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Stayed in room 21641; the elevator took forever to take us up to that level but that's expected of hotels in Vegas. The decor was nice and clean. The view was boring....nothing too spectacular. The worst part of it all was when we were trying to sleep could hear the toilet flushing upstairs that grossed me out and prevented me from sleeping. Room service was good. Called for breakfast at 5 am and got it in 20 min. It cost around $35 for a latte and a plate of eggs, potatoes, Ham and a tomato. It was pretty good and made me super full.

 I have been looking for a New York style deli like Katz's where the pastrami is made in house, etc.. Still have not found it but Archies will do in a pinch. I tried the JP Pastrami on rye with mustard and it was big and tasty. I also tried the cheese steak hoagie. The hoagie was big and well made with lettuce, onions, tomato and all but the beef was a bit chewy. Not the highest quality meat but over all a tasty sandwich that was so big I could only eat half. The cole slaw is pretty good too. I will return to try something else. Archies will be my go to deli when I'm not feeling Jason's.

 Immediate tummy ache!!! I should've stayed away after reading the reviews but it was close and it was late at night so I gave in. In short, one freezer wasn't working so all tubs were stacked on top of each other in working freezer. Took too long to sample flavors because she had to move tubs around. Husband was not impressed so just told me to chose what I wanted n get out of there. I chose on a Sunday, pictured with chocolate syrup, walnuts, banana, and two scoops of ice cream advertised at $5.50. Chose green tea and taro...ask for no chocolate syrup. Came to check out and she charged me a $0.25 fee. When I asked her what that was for she said for the banana. After pointing out the price and picture, her answer was ""That's from a long time ago"" !?!?!??!?? I told her my piece of mind, mentioned I was a yelp de-customer and went outside to eat. Halfway through my Sunday my stomach is turning... We're pulling into our driveway now and I am running straight to the toilet.

 Gaspar was lovely! We escaped there for supper with our toddler after a less-than-sterling time at Pub-St.-Paul as part of a large gathering, and it soothed us into recognizing that we had, indeed, found the quality Quebecois fare that we had sought. My steak frites were lovely, with meat that was a perfect medium-rare. My husband attempted to order his burger medium-rare, but was informed that the burgers only come medium-well, and that this is the case within all of Canada. Now, I can respect a restaurant that is sufficiently confident in their dishes to only serve them in the way that they were designed to be served, but we did both think that the the burger would have been tastier medium-rare. The pork belly was a nice addition. Our server was very friendly and accommodating, which is hugely gratifying when traveling with a toddler. We felt completely at ease eating with him there, which we weren't at first certain would be the case given the menu and decor. We felt welcomed and valued, and appreciated the warm smiles from other staff as well. We're thinking about heading back up to Montreal in the spring or summer, with the aim of hitting a number of amazing-sounding eateries that we didn't try the first time. Other than Au Pied de Cochon, which would be the main reason for the trip, Taverne Gaspar is probably the only place we visited this time that we'd give a second try on a very limited engagement, thus giving up the opportunity to try someplace new for that meal. It has definitely earned a return visit. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've always wanted to try the Farmhouse since I've heard it is so wonderful and it looks so cute. I went this morning with my friend and of course it was packed. We opted for a sunny seat on the patio rather than waiting for an inside seat even though it was a cold January morning. I think that may have been our biggest mistake. After we got our coffee, it took a full 30 minutes for our not so friendly waitress to take our order. When we finally did get our order, we had to request coffee refills and ask for pancake syrup. It got to the point where we felt like we were an inconvenience to our waitress. We were not impressed and the food wasn't worth going back for. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I won't be returning. Today, I picked up an order for my friend and I. They read back the order and it was exactly what it should be, but when I got to work, they had not put a rice krispie bar in even though they charged us for it. Additionally, my Japanese Pan noodle bowl left much to be desired. The carrots were uncooked (even though they were supposed to be) and ""topped with cilantro"" means one slimy spring of cilantro with 2 leaves on it. My friend's pasta was burnt. Burnt!

 I was very excited to visit on my trip to Vegas. I had planned on visiting a few breweries and this was one of the few on the strip. They have multiple locations along the strip. I went to the Miracle Mile Shops and was very excited to try them. I tried the Weiss, which was my least favorite..I just didn't get much complexity from it. The amber was better, but still didn't excite me. The stout was defiantly their best beer because it was rich in taste and body. I didn't get to try their Blonde. I was disappointed that I wasn't really able to talk about the beers and their style. This is the main reason I love microbreweries, you get to see and taste their passion. I probably had too high of hopes for a brewery on the strip. Makes sense why their was so much merchandise and no one too talk to. Next time I will go earlier in the afternoon. I will revisit them again next time I am in Vegas and don't have to compete with people just trying to get trashed. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Comfortable atmosphere, fantastic service, terrific prices, wonderful food, and a great beer selection - my only two wishes are a) more vegetarian options on the menu and b) that there was more of what Bulldog is doing around the neighborhood. I don't mean that in the sense that I want some schmuck-ish over-priced gastropub taking up space - I mean, more places that create a real local neighborhood atmosphere, a sense of community, with truly great food. Come on Morningside, if this is what you're capable of, let's get another business into one of those For Rent spaces!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Hohum food. Nothing special here except the view. Great spot for drinks and snacks. Patio seating during cool months. # server actually warning me *against* what I asked for. Thanks a lot, but it's not a good sign. new chef needed? # sharp scampi drowning in wine. Blechy sauce reminds me of cheap gloppy Chinese lobster sauce. shrimps bouncy, approaching rubbery. # Chicken Caesar blabla nothing special at all # pasta served cool. Sauce greasy and not fresh. I can have cold-food-leftovers-style at home, GODDAMIT! # meatball sandwich uninspired, hohum. Service was attentive despite other reviews here, but the pace was empty.

 I won't deny that Hendersons is an Edinburgh institution. It was the first specially vegetarian restaurant in Edinburgh in the 70s, at a time when people were beginning to become aware of it. Despite the mainstream disapproval of vegetarianism this place was really trendy, and still rides on its fame from the good old days. We are lucky to have the number of vegetarian restaurants in Edinburgh that we do today. This, however, means more competition for Hendersons. Nonetheless it still remains probably the best known. I have mixed feelings about Hendersons however. On one hand it provides a great variety of generally good quality vegetarian food, on the other its pricey for what you pay for and the menu never really seems to change. It's a great shame that some of the other criticisms here have confused some generally bad experiences that could have happened at any restaurant, with the fact this restaurant just happens to be vegetarian. It's clearly fallacious to say that just because your cake wasn't creamy enough vegetarian restaurants must disapprove of creamy cakes. Any restaurant could serve you a disappointing flapjack. It reminds me of the sort of arguments you here from intolerant travellers when they are abroad and don't like something they've been served or whatever and equate it with something necessary about the culture or the people. That aside Hendersons does have it downside. I love their chickpea and tomato stew, but it's not that special, it's something I cook all the time and don't expect to pay \ u00a36 for it. I love their crusty bread with curry, but could they change it around more often? I find Hendersons can be too expensive for simple dishes that seem to always be the same (albeit from a great range). On the former point I sometimes feel that Hendersons now caters mostly for the New Town residents, perhaps the rebellious youth of the 70s now all grown up and able to afford it. They do offer a student discount however. But now let me defend Hendersons and say that the quality of the food, both nutritionally and taste wise, is still high above the average, and unlike most pubs or standard Italian restaurants, I don't feel like I owe my body an apology after eating there. I don't think that a slab of flesh maketh a meal (considering our bodies aren't made to eat meat with every meal and that 6-7% of the worlds population live without meat, through choice or circumstance, this claim seems ridiculous). I think to claim that Hendersons is a place that can be ""okay for some lifestyles but not for me really"" or ""not really my thing cos I eat meat"" is a claim from someone who hasn't tried the range of dishes available here, or has some problematic addiction to one particular food group (besides presumably these people don't literally eat meat with every single meal: breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacking- or they probably don't have much longer to live). Again, you might not like Hendersons because they are rude or the dishes are cold or you thought the curry tasted crap, but the mere absence of meat in a place surely does not make it a pleasure only for the select few. Incidentally Hendersons is not unfriendly, the dishes aren't cold and nearly all the dishes I've tried (quite a number) have tasted very nice. A great vegetarian institution that still remains a great option despite some setbacks. ",0,0,0,1,0

The woman at the front desk treated me with respect while getting all her requirements met. She came responded to my call about a party in the next room and quieted them immediately. The real highlight was the breakfast. The woman in charge, Elaine, ran a clean, organized, attractive dining room. The selections were plentiful and the quality was fresh. And they had a really cool Pancake Machine! Two freshly made pancakes dropped on your plate in about 2 minutes.

 Let's start by saying I nor the other person in my party eat pork. We spent 5 minutes talking with the waitress how pork does not belong in a lobster roll and ordered a lobster roll with NO bacon. The lobster roll came out with bacon. We told the waitress and she took away the roll and the manager came over. They did not bring us a new roll but instead gave us a free milkshake (which we didn't even want) the bill came and we mentioned something about taking the roll off since it was made incorrectly and we were never brought a new one. They wouldn't take it off the bill because they gave us a milkshake that we didn't even want. I can't believe Mario and Bastianich put their name on this place. Obviously it's just so they can make money. They definitely wouldn't eat the slop served here. The cod sandwich was flavor less and soggy. I wish we would have ate at Mcdonalds (no joke) ",1,0,0,0,0

 lured by the chocolate fountain i decided to investigate. Got hungry so i bought a small dessert and a sandwich. The raspberry macaroon was okay...to me it was a bit too sweet. i thought the fresh raspberry would give it a tart kick but it was actually really sweet. the sugared rose petal on top was pretty cool too. also tried to smoked salmon sandwich which was pretty darn good i must say. The bread looked hard but it was soft and light. it had a good smoked flavor and instead of feeling like a sandwich is compiled of many ingredients it actually was infused together to give it 1 good flavor.

 Service sucks. And the food sucks. Only reason why I am giving 2 stars is because the DJ is sort of good. And I like the horror-theme they got going on inside, the Jason and zombie bride human figures looks pretty cool. Other than that, this place reminds me of those trashy joints back up in Reno, with art posers all full of themselves inside. They would rather chain smoke than work on their tip, and I regret tipping the bartender before my service was done, especially since she forgot that I prepaid for my second round of drinks and didn't even bother getting started on what I ordered from the menu. When my burger, pasta, and fries finally made it on my table, it was FUCKING COLD! Except the thick fries. It's the same cheap fries that you get from Walmart and throw it into a microwave. The stuff that college kids eat because they are too lazy to cook something real up. Burger was lukewarm, does not feel fully cooked. Everything on the plate felt and tasted like it was made with a half-assed effort. Like they tossed the entire stuff into the microwave and took 15 minutes to bring it back out. Like what a previous reviewer said, they are trying to do everything at once, and failing at every aspect of it. There are plenty of other places along the Chinatown area where the workers take more pride in their jobs. Here, this place is sort of nasty. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This review is more for the local looking to hang out by a pool. This is not the place! Yes, we got in for free being on the guest list but if you do not have a cabana or lounge chair reserved, forget laying out by the pool. Something the VIP guy forgot to mention to us before we said yes to the guest list even when we confirmed we didn't need a reservation. You can sit on benches up near the bar for free and that's about it. My friend I like to listen to music, have some beer, and chill out at the pool but with only 2 of us, we were not about to drop $500 (or more depending on where we would sit.) Plus the place is so small that I could not imagine it packed. We left and went to the Flamingo where we know we can have a seat, enjoy the atmosphere and have room to actually stand up. I don't know if I would even come back to Tao when I do have 10 people with me and pay for this place. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I don't even know where to start. Maybe with the stained tablecloth? Or maybe with the decorations held up by masking tape? Oh, I know! How about the fact that we had to wait half an hour for our entrees! This place looks gross, inside and out, and the food I had was really superlatively awful. I love Indian food because it is so flavorful, and this completely failed to live up to expectations. I had the Samosas, which weren't TOO awful, and the Palak Paneer, which literally had almost no flavor at all. To add insult to injury everything was cold, we didn't get any rice (I guess you're supposed to buy it separately? Would have been nice to know...) and service took FOREVER which is totally understandable since there was ONE other table in the entire place. The only reason we went to this place was because we mistakenly bought a groupon that we thought was for the other Saffron that is closer to us, but if I had known what it was going to be like I would have just kissed the money for the groupon goodbye and NOT BOTHERED.

 ""Who will tell them? You need me to tell them how you helped at the hotel. They blame you for all their misfortunes. "" -- Hotel Rwanda (2004) I am a Marriott snob - I prefer to stay in Marriotts wherever I go. I love the points, I love the service, I love the status. This time, we stayed here because of the ease and convenience to where our meetings would be and unfortunately that was a mistake. The front desk staff was the nicest thing about this location. Don't get me wrong, the room was clean and well made, but lots of little things add up very quickly. First, I was right by the lobby - so sound was a MAJOR issue. Any conversations had in the lobby - I could hear (and quite well). The walls were thin as I could hear conversations in the next room as well (not just their TV). The breakfast was fine - included in the cost of the room - but the toaster did not work very well at all (so you ended up with hot bread instead of toasted) and the juices were like water with flavoring. Also the scrambled eggs were like rubber and from powder or egg beaters or something - very watery. The coffee - also not very good. Thank goodness there was a Starbucks across the street. The A/C units were the old-style and made insane noises when cutting on and off all night - not very helpful when trying to sleep. Time to upgrade, Marriott. My co-worker and I agree that we won't be staying here again. Probably the Courtyard across the street or something nicer a little further from the customer next time around. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We went to lunch here and I have got to say, it was pretty gross. I ordered the asian chicken salad with shrimp. It was literally a handful of lettuce with 5 shrimp on top.

The fries tasted like they were cooked several hours before and and had a weird after taste. Everything was pretty bad - like - didn't want to pay for it, it was so bad.

 We went here 2x. The first night was AMAZING. (The night before my wedding) then the night of my wedding after our reception we were all going to go out to celebrate. our promoter said he could get our party of 15 in. Our limo bus was late to get us and we were 10 minutes late for the guys to get in free (midnight). And we told our promoter and he said it would be fine and he'd get us in. We get there exactly 10 minutes late, tell the bouncer legit laughed in our faces told us that we couldn't get in unless the guys paid cover and we tried to text the promoter to help us out and they tried to heard us out of line and one huge bouncer shoved one of the guys we were with (who also was in a car accident and has back problems) and he looked at he manager who was there and asked ""are you really going to let your guy put his hands on me"" and the manager said ""I didn't see nothing"". Even tho he clearly did. My wedding night was spent at shitty bar on the strip when I was looking forward to being at this popping place. So I laid in my bed at the flamingo trying to fall asleep hearing the club going hard all night. It was such a tease :( I'm sorry for the low review but you guys need to get your people in check so your promoters give out accurate info. We would've been fine going in but the reason why it was an issue was with a $30 Cover the guys would've had less than $20 to spend on their overly priced drinks so it would've been pointless.

 Chose this hotel since I was in town visiting wife and had some hotel points to burn. Had I done my homework I would have stayed somewhere else. I am a top tier member of their frequent stay program. The room we were given was nothing special. We had a broken refrigerator outside of our room when we arrived. The room service trays that were in the hallway when we checked in stayed there for two days. The air conditioner barely kept the room cool enough. The refrigerator they put in the room wouldn't cool bottled water down unless it was put in freezer. This hotel looks and feels old. The pools inside and out didn't appear to have been cleaned in a while. We never ate at the hotel as there are many other places our family had planned for us to eat at.

 While having a local plumber readily available is great, I am glad to have other options. We were charged for two plumbers (and twice the labor cost) to fix a relatively easy problem, as told to us by other plumbers. Additionally, the finishing touches they did, including calking, were not great quality. I think perhaps they feel like they have a captive audience in the neighborhood. Thankfully, that isn't the case and there are many other plumber options. We've learned our lesson. ",0,1,0,0,0

He is a huge fan of this deal, but unfortunately did NOT receive it, since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, and they only offer their lunch specials on WEEKDAYS. Another slight issue I had was the fact that the waiter messed up my order, but the manager gladly replaced it free-of-charge for me, and gave me her humble apologies. Once I received the dish I ordered - beef medallions over fettuccine alfredo - it was actually pretty tasty. It featured green onions, chives, sauteed spinach, and tasted pretty fresh, discounting the strong vinaigrette coating on the steak.

 ***Montreal Burger Week*** Since it was my last night off of the week I decided to take advantage and get at least one contender for the Montreal Burger Week under my belt so that I wouldn't have missed the whole thing like last year. Newtown was near to my destination and I had about an hour to kill so when I saw the instagrammed photo I just had to try it. Burger, toasted bun, cheddar cheese, fried egg, onions, chipotle mayo, and a nice big patty. Not just any patty, a patty that consisted of pulled pork surrounded by angus beef and then wrapped in bacon. Gluttony for punishment? Don't mind if I do! I'm glad I took a salad as my side or else I probably would have gotten heart palpitations, but it also gave the kitchen a chance to let me taste their wonderfully balanced yet tangy salad dressing. Yum. The only thing I would have added would have been to top it with quick-fried onions or caramelized onions instead but even with the regular onions the burger was top notch. so... full... but... want... another...

 Now that I've seen what a club SHOULD look like (the new Mountainside Pavillions Club), I'm going to give this club only 3/5. We've been coming here for years, the renovation a year ago was needed, but they charged everyone $25 to pay for it. Pluses-front desk staff great, personal trainers are wonderful and always working us hard, lots of group classes. Negatives-cardio equipment at times is packed and seems to break down frequently (TVs, iPod jacks, rock, look dingy), the bathrooms were not renovated (men's showers/tile work need replacing, would be nice to be brought up to standards of Pavillions!)), the exercise equipment in big group room is not cleaned/repaired and they run out of regularly (big balls, rubber tubbing, rubberized hand weights are coming apart). Yoga room needs more floor space (still!) so is there some way to put in shoulder high shelves for the mats/blankets/bricks and also other shelves for people's shoes/purses to give us more floor sq ft? This was done in big fitness room for big balls/etc. Not safe when we are packed on like sardines. New Pavillions spin bikes are wonderful, we were suppose to get new bikes, but they delivered the refurbs. Old ones suck.

Even with the crowd, I barely had time to fill up my drink before my order was ready and on the counter, and everything was cooked perfectly and as ordered. The thing that really stood out about this burger was the bacon. Holy hell, that might be some of the best, most crispy bacon I've even had the pleasure of eating . Trust me, I eat A LOT of bacon, you might even call me a bacon connoisseur, so you can take my word for it when I say this place has incredible bacon. Frankly, Five Guys is better than In-N-Out. There, I said it. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have nothing but love for this place. One of the best steaks I have ever had. The service is great and I love that it is off Strip so no traffic hassles. I appreciate the fact that two sides come with the entree unlike some other steak houses where everything is separate. This place is a great value too if you utilize the restaurant.com coupon.

 Was here for the 2nd time the other night. The food here is awesome! The pizza definitely has more of an authentic Italian feel to it. Got the prosciutto and arugula pizza last time I went. The crust is perfect - it's not super crispy thin - but still light and perfect. Oh, the dessert is pretty awesome too! We ordered a cannoli and tiramisu. Whatever the stuff that's stuffed in the cannoli tastes like chocolate chip cookie dough without being overwhelming. The service wasn't the greatest which is why I'm only giving it 4. I think it was the owner who took care of us, and maybe cuz it was the end of the day or something - but he didn't seem to be in the greatest of moods and wasn't all to welcoming or friendly. We didn't let it get to us. This place is definitely tucked away in a random tiny strip mall on Thomas. You miss it if you blink. But definitely worth the stop to check out. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Its a must try when you go to Vegas. The one word that describes the dining experience is WOW.

 This place was recommended by some good friends. I have to say, good service, decent food and a good margarita. Nothing spectacular, but good. A little pricey for the quality though. The main thing that upset me was, the ""fried ice cream"". We all know what fried ice cream is and when you're served a ball of ice cream rolled in soggy corn flakes... WTH... Not impressed. And they still charged me 7.99 after I complained about it. So, good service, decent food and drink, laughable dessert. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This place is not new I had bookmarked it awhile ago but with the business of life I kind of forgot about it but wow am I glad I re found it! I do not hand out 5 stars often but when I do I feel it is well deserved This place is a high class Japanese Tapas. My man suggested coming by for the late happy hour on a night we were out down town on the way home. I pulled up to this not so easy to pull up to place. Trust me if you have to do a turn around please and must do! You walk into a semi light modern designed room, welcomed warmly by the staff not yelled at from across the room. The manager at some point came over and explained the menu and how it is changed sometimes daily. The dishes are highly thought out and prepared with amazing technique. I was so impressed and so happy with our food. We will defiantly be back! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Overrated! My boyfriend and I went to Vegas for my birthday over Memorial day weekend. Saturday we decided to go to Tao nightclub. We arrived at the Venetian and were ushered into one of two huge lines, (a guest list line and a regular line) like cattle, well, decked out scantily clad anorexic cattle. After slowly moving to the front of the line which wrapped around the building, we were not found to be on the guest list and had to pay the 40$ for guys and 20$ for girls cover! You can get on the guest list ahead of time by visiting the web site well before arriving. Then we are ushered into a maze of dark hallways (still packed in herd formation) but now we are inside and you could start to tell there was little ventilation and experience 'second hand breath'. We stopped at one of the first dance floors and wanted to try to find a place to sit . I asked one of the security/ushers and I got a - HA! Good luck, I guess you can try to sit in the tables until the VIP's who reserved them arrive. I didn't realize this was a privilege to sit. I have only come to Vegas on non weekends before so being a Saturday night on Memorial Day weekend was a completely different experience. So we decide to get a drink. The 'line' to get a drink was like a bee hive pack of people several layers deep which you had to just keep pushing your way to the front as each club goer emerged with their drink. I decided to get something simple since it seemed there was no muddling going on for my picky taste in martinis. I got the feeling if I had asked for a lemon drop I would have had a 'soup Nazi' response of NO MARTINI FOR YOU. The bartenders seemed to want to get you out of there as fast as possible. I ordered a vodka cranberry and my boyfriend his Jack and Coke. I figured my 20$ would cover two single well drinks. Not! It was 32$ for a small bucket type glass. Paid my tab and tried to protect my precious cargo as I made my way out of the bar line/swarm. We walked over to the dance floor and it was just packed and I was getting overwhelmed with the recycled breath and asked where is it less crowded. Thankfully someone told us to make our way up to Tao Beach. As we ascended the stairs, which were like office building type stairwells surrounded by red painted walls with an occasional photo or directional sign on them, we could start to sense the fresh air ahead. After several flights of stairs we finally made it to the rooftop open air Beach. It was a totally different atmosphere! Very open and airy, lots colorful lights and VIP cabanas lined the perimeter. There were very few people up there at that point. It was around 10:00 or so, so we enjoyed having a huge increase in personal space and to move and breathe freely. We found a table / wicker couch/bench type thing with a few pillows that was unoccupied in the middle area of the club. This was a major score as my boyfriend, with great fashion sense and taste, had just got me a super cute pair of 5"" gladiator heels - which I decided to wear / break in that evening. I would have made a different decision on wearing NEW shoes if I knew we needed to get a loan to sit down virtually anywhere we went. Still nursing the overpriced well drink, we looked at the menu on the table for the fee for bottle service, thinking with one shot being 16$ we may be better off with bottle service. The cheapest fifth of Vodka was 600$ for Skyy I think it was. We decided to just have one or two drinks here, soak up the atmosphere and drink for real back in our room or somewhere else. We did enjoy people watching from our comfy albeit temporary spot. There were no cocktail servers that would come by, there seemed to only be there for the VIP cabanas. Several cocktail servers, guys dressed in all black and more girls in fishnets and burlesque type outfits, were parked on the perimeter . The music was good and we actually got to relax and have fun there. After about 45 minutes or so we were asked to move as the group of 6 or 7 young guys arrived who had reserved the table. By now it had become more crowded and twice I was bumped into by a waiter swishing by carelessly trying to rush through the crowd (to the VIP cabana's). I was pretty irritated to lose 5$ worth of my drink in each elbow bump! That is when I decided - I am going to Yelp this! - and that it was time to go. So based on the amount of people they packed in, lack of fresh air, the overpriced drinks, lack of seating and lack of cocktail servers for regular people, that earns -1 stars. The Tao Beach atmosphere was the only positive for me. The fresh air, lots of lights, decent music, and laid back mellow atmosphere earns a couple of stars back. I still would not want to go back nor recommend going unless you are a VIP - so, as a regular person, I ended up with the 1 star rating. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I moved very near this restaurant about a year and a half ago. The first time we tried it, we loved it enough to keep going back several times. The food was delicious and original -- not what you get at a typical generic americanized mexican restaurant. The place has really gone down hill a lot in a short time. The latest time we went will also probably be the last time we go. The food simply stank. Everything came with a pile of hard purple cabbage, which unlike the typical but useful pile of lettuce&tomatoes, was nothing more than garnish. (this cabbage can be seen in just about all of the photos others have posted) Dishes that had been consistently good over several visits were suddenly changed, and not for the better. My daughter's shrimp tostada thing was a portion size almost half of what it used to be, and if she's going to order something that costs more than what I order, It'd better be worth it, dammit! I know Parrilla Suiza has long been considered agreat place, and not your typical mexican restaurant, but it just isn't the case anymore. I am curious if any other former long-time customers are recently feeling the same? ",0,1,0,0,0

 Had a couple of hours to kill and wasn't sure what or where to eat before watching a movie so we checked out what was on tap in the casino. Our choice was Vino Italian dining. So this has 2 parts, a dine in sit down experience and a what to seem from outside a pizza take away. No real reservation was required. We walked in and we're sat down to a casino style or standard Italian decor setting. The dress code was casual, so ladies leave your cocktail dresses at home, and fellas that bow tie you wanted to wear won't do you any justice here. The menu was your typical run of the mill american Italian dishes that neither disappoints nor gets your belly rumbling. We had unlimited garlic bread which seemed to be pretty fresh. And the glasses of wine were a heavy pour. (Smiley face) Ordered the pork stuffed shells. Now this wasn't a bad dish, it had some great flavor and interesting sauce that may have been made in house. A couple of Knocks on this place was the food was so hot when it came out, the sauces were still boiling on our dishes. We had to wait 15 minutes or so to even try it. So that was a little bummer. I can't give this place 5 stars, it isn't the worlds best Italian restaurant but if you have 3 star expectations, this place ain't a bad selection if your looking in the casino with half decent prices.

 Ate there tonight for the first time. I do have to say the prices are very fair. The service staff is very ""alternative"" Lots of tats, bull nose rings, big hole ear stretch earnings, I don't mind alternative but hygiene has to be there and I felt it wasn't. They were out of about seven menu items and the service was very slow and lacked any genuine hospitality. I'll give it one more shot because several friends of mine rave about the place but I was not impressed with my first visit. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have driven by Drago Sisters on quite a few occasions but finally gave them a chance last week when we were passing by and my mom and I were craving a sweet. We swung by and the place was surprisingly packed for a weekday. We waited patiently in this very tiny bakery and were helped quickly. My mom and I decided to share a lemon bar and I got a chocolate truffle ball for my fella. The lemon bar was nice and tart but the texture was a little chewier than I'm used so I'm not sure if it was a little stale or not. I enjoyed the flavor, but my mom was a little disappointed. I tried a little nibble of my fella's truffle and it was decent. The chocolate costing was a little too rich but I peeled that off and I enjoyed the inside. My fella wasn't enjoying his truffle at all so we traded halfway through and he seemed tk enjoy the lemon bar quite a bit. I'd be curious to try more of the treats here, but I'm not in a big rush to give them another try since nothing blew me away. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I was in the mood for cupcakes and found this place. I must admit that this place has a nice concept: build your own cupcake. You choose the cake, filling, frosting and topping. I opted for the LEMON and RED VELVET cupcake with the cream cheese frosting. I felt that the filling might be too sweet. The red velvet was a bit dry around the edges and top. The inside was a bit more moist but not by that much. It didn't have the rich cocoa taste that I was craving.. The lemon was TOO lemony. I must say it was moist but the rich lemon taste overwhelmed me. PLUS the cream cheese frosting was TOO sweet. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I came here for dinner tonight, which was my second visit, the first being a few months ago for lunch. Thai Hut is pretty good. I am making a tiny comparison to Thai Elephant based on price and location, but I like different things about both places. I like the quick service at Thai Hut, even at lunch when it gets busy. The first time, I had the Pad Cee Ew (and completely butchered that spelling, but they don't have an online menu! I tried to find the proper spelling.) It was ok, but a little bland. My friend had the drunken noodles and they were awesome. Tonight I had the Yellow Curry Chicken and it was very good. Also the Thai Iced Teas were decent. Dinner was a little more pricey than I would have liked (only based on similiar places and portion sizes) but their lunch prices are spot on. ",0,0,1,0,0

 At 1pm on a Wednesday we were the only customers. Service was friendly, but slow. The 2 servers/manager were too busy chatting on the phone in the back or eating their own lunch. Another group departing as we came in seemed to be waiting at the front counter for about 10 minutes for the girl in the office to finish her phone call and close their tab. Food was good, reasonably priced for a lunch combo with more than enough food. 3 of us ordered the lunch special (2 vegetarian, 1 chicken) which were all good, although the heat level was off. The 2 vegetarians asked for heat level 3 (offered range of 1-10) while the chicken was requested as a 9. Both came out around a 5. Why bother asking if you're not going to follow through. Portions were good but oddly served. Lunch combo includes salad, chutneys, rice, naan, entree, side, and desert. For our group of 3 we were served 2 bowls of rice and 2 pieces of naan. We didn't run out, so it was ok, but seemed odd when everything else was served in individual dishes. We had to ask for the salad and chutneys which were forgotten. Masala Chai tea (which to me is the barometer of quality for any restaurant) was just ok. Too much fennel/anise flavor, and too thick/heavy being made with a lot of whole milk. I checked in on yelp (which is how I found the place, after my first choice and favorite Udupi turned out to be closed/out of business!). Yelp specified it was open for lunch, and offered a $15 for $25 coupon, which I purchased. It wasn't until the end of the meal and attempting to pay that I was rudely told the promo wasn't valid with the lunch special. I told her that wasn't mentioned in the terms, she made some excuse and wandered off. I decided I'd just take it up with Yelp later, and put my card in the folio. Unfortunately she disappeared and after about 10 minutes of waiting I tracked her down in the office behind the hostess stand, knocking on the door and interrupting her personal phone call. At that point I was getting upset. with the service and called her out on the yelp promo, insisting that the only restrictions are that it's not valid for takeout or on Fridays/Saturdays. She disagreed but finally said she'd honor it and wrote down the promo code and adjusted my bill. Overall the food was good but service was unacceptable. Portions and prices if ordering the lunch combo were reasonable but ala-carte and dinner menu pricing were excessive and the portions are probably the same judging by other reviews. I would not return given the variety of other Indian options in the area. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I had read all the Yelp reviews and purchased a Groupon for an oil change from Central Car Care. I am very disappointed. The actual experience was great during the service. One of the workers made coffee for me and the lounge area was nice for a car shop. I was advised that my truck needed a water pump, belts, and an alignment which I got done elsewhere due to a better cost. I think they were upset that I turned down the additional service because a week after the oil change I found out that none of my fluids had been topped off, that my battery and alternator were almost dead (no one bothered to check the battery at all during a 16-point inspection), and that my oil change gauge had not been reset. I would not go back to this shop. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Pretty good for Chinese food in Vegas, which isn't saying much. Over the years I've ordered from here, due to the lack of better options and occasionally their food was pretty good. Before this review I would have given them 3 stars. This review is for my most recent experience. My food arrived cold, which wasn't a huge deal to me it just made the food less appetizing. Then I was eating my soup, pretty decent flavor, but there was plastic in it. It was a small plastic bag right in my soup. I thought it was cabbage, but when I realized it wasn't edible in my mouth I spit it out and noticed it was a small cut bag. So gross! So if you decide to order from here, check your food thoroughly.

 Well for starters I like the fact that finally a decent place has opened up in the big intersection of University and Mill. They are directly competing with Chilli's and P.F.Chang's now! ( Really??). Well the place doesnt seem too busy for now, not like the one in Scottsdale (atleast yet!). Place is very loud. The setting of the place and ambiance seem to be crying oldtown culture out loud, which brings some freshness to mill ave, but only time will tell how the crowd here is going to accept that. oh and I dont remember there being any drink specials or such.

 The good thing about writing a review is that it may take a few days before you complete it. Wings Over Pittsburgh has totally benefited from this. If I would have wrote a review after my first experience with this establishment it would be less stars and bitter words. I completely love the wrap they have available here. It is a meal unto itself. Nothing really special about it, plain flour tortilla, lettuce, tomato and pieces of boneless wings with your choice of sauce or dry rub. I have tried several different sauces and one dry rub. For the wrap it is best to choose a sauce, if you get a dry rub, you will need something to dip it in, or hope that the juices from the tomatoes and lettuce will make it tasty. You can add crinkle cut fries for $1 or seasoned waffle fries for $1.50. As I said before, the wrap itself is more than enough for a meal. When I get the fries with it I always feel like I'm stupid for doing so. I can never finish both and I hate to waste it. My friends always order the ribs from here and are never disappointed. If I was a rib man I would be too. They look mighty good. (minus two stars for my first encounter with you, but plus one star because you totally redeemed yourself and credited me on my next order) ",0,0,0,1,0

 Customer service is lacking at this location. The guy on the phone put me on hold and forgot to mute the phone or actually put it on hold. I heard the whole conversation with his buddy and other customers. Besides the ridiculously low trade in value they give you here (which is expected) the service is terrible. I won't go In here unless I absolutely have to actually no I rather go to Walmart (and that tells you a lot). I bought a new game but received an opened copy in a envelope sleeve. And I asked why that was and he said it was because they needed empty display cases. I told him I wanted a new one that was sealed and said he couldn't give me a sealed one. I asked him if the new copies came with any downloadable content he said he didn't no but most likely no. I should of left and spent my money else where. Lucky for them I was in a hurry.

 Stayed here two months ago on a get away for my anniversary. My boyfriend and I are not super big partiers but figured an affordable vacation to Vegas to see some shows and have fun was in order. We got to the hotel and it wasn't too far off of the strip which was great. Our room was decent. But we had the strangest thing happen, and were not happy with how it was handled. We picked up some things to drink on the way to the hotel. There's a key to lock your fridge, which we had a bottle of vodka in and some beers and we didn't lock it. We came back to the room on our second day there, after only having two or three drinks out of the bottle, we opened up the fridge to find that it was almost empty. This was after our room had been cleaned. It wasn't like this was expensive alcohol but we decided to let the front desk know. You would think they would want to know if someone that works for them may be drinking on the job or taking anything in general. After we let them know the next time we opened the fridge on the next day (also after housekeeping had come) we noticed the vodka all of a sudden had doubled. We let them know it had been tampered with again and then they sent up a security person to our room. Now, I can understand that 99.9% of the time people probably drink it and forget and complain because it's Vegas...and that happens. But that was not the case, I was that .1%. The response we got from the security guy is that we had drank the alcohol and we just forgot, and he said that multiple times. I did NOT appreciate that. It may be silly but that's telling me I'm a liar. We were not asking for anything free, and I am still un-amused by that response. They offered us a free breakfast after we first had mentioned it to them which was lovely...until we got back later in the day and they had messed with it again. Had we even the littlest doubt that we may have drank it we would not have been complaining. Maybe you have a housekeeper that likes to drink on the job...ever think about that? Won't be back. All it took was an interest in the issue we were having and not telling us it was our fault and it would've been just fine. ",0,1,0,0,0

Not too overbearing, not too shoddy. Just right. I had an original burger, because I'm a plain kind of girl. The food took a wee while to come but when it did it was worth it because IT WAS THE BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD. Well, so far anyway.

 We were having a couple of friends over for some memorial weekend bbq so we wanted to check out the butcher shop for some steaks and charcuterie. We frequent the restaurant often and always wonder what's going on with all the meat displayed in huge refrigerators near the entrance of the restaurant. The butcher (Aaron) was EXTREMELY helpful. He suggested a nice mix of charcuterie based on our adventurousness as well as provided some great tips on how to cook the steak. With our skirt steak, he suggested that the best way to get an even temperature is to flip the steak every minute (vs flipping it once). He also suggested wines and cheeses that would go well with the charcuterie. Even wrote it all down on butcher paper for us! He really knows his stuff! Is it a little on the pricey side? Sure, but not more than Whole Foods. You are getting premium service and products so you def get what you pay for here. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Agreed with everyone else that the place is clean and still brand new looking (six months after and the 'Now Open' sign is still up) The pickled carrots were pretty good, had a pleasant sour taste with pickling seasonings and a slow creeping heat to it. 2 Sopes one chicken one beef. The beef was pretty tasteless Chicken tasted a lot better but wasnt by much Rice was okay Refried beans were good reseasoned so they didnt have a canned taste. Also got a Horchata for 50 cents extra.

 We wanted to find a place open for lunch that was casual. My husband was craving a burger so we found Big Dogs (it was Christmas day). We both ordered burgers and they were delicious! Juicy, large and all the toppings were fresh (tomatoes, lettuce, etc.) (posted pictures of the food, but not sure where they are...check my profile maybe.) My 5 year old also had a burger and enjoyed it all. He is a big fan...as now when we drive by the place he yells ""Big Dogs!"" The service was really professional and friendly. The place is very clean and a nice casual atmosphere. We will definitely go back (this was our first visit). It was Christmas afternoon so the place was pretty empty. We enjoyed that it was this way! No wait, immediate seating and no loud noises. They were also playing highlights of football (especially the Steelers ;-) . We look forward to trying other menu items and would consider going to some of their events they advertise. Great burgers! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've never been a big fan of Party City and this Party City is no different than any of the others I've been to. The parking lot is pretty crazy though, since there are so many other businesses in the area. It can be a madhouse trying to get here, especially during the lunch hour. The inside is laid out the same as most Party Cities, but I've never memorized this. I still get lost and can't always find what I'm looking for, which can be frustrating. This place seemed dingy, but the lighting wasn't good either. The prices are decent, especially for party items that you know are just going to be thrown away after one use.

 Went here on a Friday night with a friend for some beer and good Southern cooking. The beer was good but I was ultimately disappointed with the food. We shared a pulled pork sandwich, a plate of baby back ribs and fried chicken. The pulled pork sandwich was the only good thing we ate that night. The meat was tender and the bun to meat ratio was acceptable. Coleslaw as a side was traditional and served its purpose. The ribs were mediocre at best. It was a bit dry and the BBQ sauce had a bit too much molasses for my liking. The fried chicken was the worst I've had in awhile. One piece was so dry I couldn't eat it. I asked for yam fries and they gave me half regular fries and a small portion of yam fries. Sigh. The service was awesome but I don't think I'll be coming back here unless it's for the pulled pork. Let's hope they improve. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This is by far the nicest spa I've ever frequented. I got a Spafinder deal for a $99 facial (Mon.-Thurs.). Not sure I would be as effusive about this place if I had paid regular price ($180) for my facial, but anyway . . . . The locker room was impeccably clean--a must for me! The vanity area had plenty of supplies--hairbrushes, cotton swabs, razors, toothbrushes and toothpaste. I enjoyed the fitness center, which was enormous and empty. Each bike/elliptical/treadmill has its own TV screen, which is a nice touch. They provide bottled water, towels, and headphones. After the workout, I enjoyed the Roman bath (a large jacuzzi), the artic room (it snows when you wallk in!), the dry sauna (nice temperature), adn the steam room (ditto). You are supposed to wait in the Tea Room for your treatment. They provide plenty of magazines, fruit juice, and snacks (pretzels, bananas) to make the wait as painless as possible. To enhance the relaxing vibe, the Tea Room is the only place in the spa with a clock. The staff offers to take your order from a menu of about 8 loose leaf teas. One final caveat: On the weekends, in addition to being more expensive, I suspect that Qua is more crowded and thus may not be the tranquil retreat it was when I visited. ",0,0,0,1,0

 A great new addition to the DeMarco family of ventures. This was a pre-opening tasting, so they're still working on all of the fine points. Nonetheless, it is a terrific spot. The structure itself is very appealing, as they restored a 1940's-era building and exposed its beautiful brickwork, which is complimented with a stained concrete floor. The bar is a proper one with a wide array of liquors and fairly ample seating for the size of the space. The patio definitely will be the preferred seating choice so long as the weather cooperates. We tried macaroni and cheese as well as the cole slaw starters; for $3 each, you could make a delicious, reasonably-priced meal from a collection of the starters. The double dip starter (cobb dip and posole salsa with chips) was very good, though I almost preferred the dip and salsa without the chips because they're so flavorful. The mixed grain salad was a good choice, too, though I might try to find something other than the orange vinagrette to put on it. The wine on tap was tasty, and they'll also have a small list of about 8 bottles. Again, the official opening isn't until the 25th, so they're still honing the fine edges. In any event, we'll be there far too often for our own good! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I went to the Chelsea to see Lana Del Rey. I had General Admission tickets and have been to MANY GA venues and concerts. When I arrived at the Chelsea they first had you enter a room, somewhat of a waiting room where they had a make shift line barrier made out of tables. You had ushers checking tickets and providing wrist bands before heading to the long line. As we were waiting in line, the doors to the venue opened and literally there was a stampede of people running to the door, to the point where they climbed over each other and knocked over tables. There was little security for crowd control and the security that was there, obviously had no experience in handling these types of situations. They had half of the ""waiting room"" literally waiting another 1/2 hour until everyone moved back and ""controlled themselves"". How about asking the crowd to create one or two lines, open the doors and ensure everyone gets in, in an orderly fashion. I never experienced anything like this, even at rave concerts. However, once inside the venue wasn't that bad but the drinks were way overpriced. Despite all that drama, Lana was amazing and we had good time. My advice to the venue: Train your employees on crowd control and create a better system for your customers to enter the venue. The sooner you get people inside, the more money you will make off of your overpriced drinks. :) ",0,1,0,0,0

 Dear Monty's, I miss you so, so much out here in Boston. We've had quite the long-term relationship: from late-night pie after high school dances, to my stint as a busgirl/counter in the ever-important Sunday brunch rush, your old blue tshirts with ""World's Best Coffee"" on the back, to dinner before a show at the Barrymore, to my going back each time I'm in town to run into familiar faces. For years, Tim and Roma and a large posse have made this tiny former gas station a stalwart in the Madison dining scene. Monty's, you and the Barrymore have rejuvenated Atwood Ave. You, and your vegetarian comfort food, zucchini-potato pancakes, scrambled something-or-other, andes mint cheesecake, chocolate malts (don't ask how much ice cream goes into those, btw. but it's all from the Chocolate Shoppe), muffins, pumpkin bars. I could go on and on. And how. For all of you lucky enough to reside around this place, please take advantage. There's nothing like it anywhere else. Sincerely, Angelina ",0,0,0,0,1

 I just attended a wedding here in early June. DO NOT BOOK it in the heat of the summer! Even though the fountains' ambiance gave it that babbling brook sound, it did nothing to offset the heat. I was amazed no one passed out! They tried fans on the sides but they blew so hard, no one could sit near them or hear anything.And even though we were moved into the reception area after 1/1/2 hours of pictures, the room never cooled off enough with the amount of attendees..To make matters worse, after the cake was cut, we were asked to relocate back outside for dancing so the staff could clean up. It was still over 100 degrees out there at 9 p.m.! If you are going to spend that kind of money in the summer months in Phoenix, go with an all air conditioned venue for the guests to enjoy.And there were only two female bathrooms available for guests to use, so there were lines often. Now on the positive,the garden was very nice although the roof of the reception area was dirty and made it appear dark.I will rate the food as o.k.because they ran out of lamb kabobs,one of the three meats offered along with chicken kabobs and roast beef , the salad was a bit wilted, most likely due to the heat ,and some of the other dishes were dry. and finally, the mashed potatoes they served were instant.I did not dare try the sushi table in that heat.The staff was excellent, very attentive,polite and pleasant. They were working very hard the entire time. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I certainly haven't been to all the venues in town, but this is the worst one yet. First, let me say that the act we saw (Lez Zeppelin) was amazing. They weren't the problem. The problem is the layout of this place. About 1/3 of the entire downstairs area is blocked by a giant staircase. So, of course, head upstairs. Except that you can't see anything unless you're in the first row...and even then the owners decided to put up drapes which obscure more of the view. Finally, there are three projected screens on one side. Two of them (the smaller ones) project a live feed of the show, but the quality of the video is terrible. And one of them (the largest and the one in the middle) is a constantly looped ad for, you guessed it, Alter Bar. Why have the screen there if you're not going to show the act? Overall, I had a great time with my friends, but that was entirely despite the venue. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Disclaimer: I work for Intel and we get some pretty good discounts and extra services here through corporate contracts. That said, this place is the perfect spot for a business traveler in the Chandler area. The food is good but even if it isn't up your alley you can walk to one of the many restaurants nearby. Rooms are good but not great. Most importantly, the beds are really good. Way more comfortable than the Marriott beds I've had here. Internet is really fast and reliable, too. Speedtest.net was showing that I was getting around 10mbps down. So pretty good overall. All in all I've had a good experience here. If you're a business traveler it's worth a look. If you're an Intel traveler there shouldn't be any other place under consideration. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is one of those places you go for the atmosphere and beer and not the food. They really do the German thing well, pretzels, spetzels and sausages a plenty. Oh yes and beer and spankings, yes spankings. If you are the S&M, Christian Grey loving person then this is the place for you. Apparently if you order a shot of this dark liquor (Perhaps Jagermister?) you get a spanking by a waitress in a laderhousen (That Hansel and Gretel outfit with suspenders). This I did not indulge in, but many many men around our table did. We went late in the evening so the giant dinning room was emptying out so I assume we didnt get to see all the possibilities of spanking. Okay so the important stuff- the food. I ordered a white sausage dish at the recommendation of the waitress, interesting. I am not a huge sausage fan, but since I was here the sausage kingdom, figured I should try it. It came with potatoes and sauerkraut. I also of course drank a lot of beer and perhaps if I drank more the food would have tasted better. We also ordered a traditional pretzel with cheese dip and mustards, now that was tasty (The beer probably helped with this). I am not going to lie the German dinners that shared our table and the authentic German band probably helped me like this place more, it certainly wasn't the food. So all in all, I would come back to drink and eat pretzels, not to eat. So drink up! Das boot! ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix, even though I don't get over here as often as I'd like. First of all, the interior is stunning. I love coming here when the weather is nice enough that the opened windows let in fresh air and crisp white light that fills the place. I've never been for dinner but that will have to be next. The first thing I ever tasted here had me trying to recreate its magic at home - a basil chicken sandwich: a large grilled chicken breast on fresh crusty bread smothered in brie aioli, basil and mushrooms. Their fries - truffle parmesan and otherwise, with tasty unique dips - are addicting. The zinc burger, mac and cheese, hanger steak are all very good. I loved the haricot verts and shitakes and ate the whole plate myself. However, the best thing I've had here, which is in the top things I've ever eaten in my life I'm so enamored with it,... is the dungeness crab crepe. If you like crab (which you should if you have a tongue) you have to try this and savor every little bite. I am a fan! Please continue making deliciousness forever. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Service was for the most part prompt but I think that's about all the positive I can say. Actually the coffee was good too. We went here for breakfast the other day as I saw the 4 star review. My wife had chicken fried steak and was rather bland and had too much gravy on it. Home fires were pretty good though. I had corned beef hash and eggs - not nearly enough corned beef served. The kicker was within an hour of leaving, we both became sick. Not crazy vomiting sick, but nauseous like you feel like your going to vomit sick - gurgling belly with heart burn. My best guess as we ordered different items was a dirty kitchen grill. ",0,1,0,0,0

 After my visit to Eide's Entertainment, I must say I am not a fan and was in no way impressed. A fact that was even more disappointing, considering it was the only store out of about five or so that I wanted to visit during my weekend in Pittsburgh that I actually got to shop at. Seeing how much other people love it, I feel that my unhappiness with Eide's probably needs some further explanation. First of all, this place is much more of a comic book store than it is a record store, something I was completely aware of going into it. However, I was still disappointed with the selection of records that the store offered. It didn't seem very diverse to me and much of it seemed extremely over priced. I ended up only buying one record from Eide's because of this. In addition, and the biggest reason I am giving Eide's two stars, is the staff here is very, very rude. No, I don't mean your typical ""I work at a record store so I am better than you"" rude you get at some stores. The employees working on the record level of the store were just plain nasty. I saw a 40+ year old man yell at my little sister for putting a record back out of alphabetical order. Keep in mind, my little sister is about 5 feet tall and maybe weigh 100 lbs. I guess that this guy gets his jollies off of bullying little girls, who knows, but it was unacceptable. To top it off, he did everything but accuse my sister of stealing the record, because he couldn't find it. Of course he couldn't find it because my sister did put it back in alphabetical order where it went. Ass. Long story short, I will never ever return to Eide's Entertainment and I would discourage anyone else who cares about being treated with some sense of decency to do the same. These guys really need to get over themselves. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've been here a ton of times and enjoyed Nine Fine Irishmen, but my last visit wasn't the best. We were coming back in the late evening (9-ish) from a show and wanted to eat. They sat us in no man's land where apparently not only were there no other diners, there were also no servers. Yikes! We waited for a long time before finally flagging someone down. We shared the sausage appetizers. Good for the first few bites but damn, that's a lot of sausage! I know, I know... that's what she said. Anyway, the sausage became pretty one note and we ended up not finishing it or ordering anything else. Our server disappeared again, pretty much never to be seen or heard from again. I will say though that I've had some pretty rockin' food here in the past. Their sandwiches are good, especially the curried chicken. Would I hit up Nine Fine again? Probably, but during daylight hours and I'd insist on having an actual server. ",0,0,1,0,0

 One of the reasons that I love Vegas so much is, as the saying goes ""What goes on in Vegas...."" things you may do there you may not be able to do at home or in your home town. Case in point, assume I drive down to Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo. I head over to the food court and slide over to the juice bar for a smoothie and get comfortable. I then sit down and pull out a churchill sized Arturo Fuente God of Fire, and begin to light it. Before the tip of the cigar even begins its glowy red path, I am immediately pummeled with various food products and verbal epitaphs, especially from a rather surly group of girl scouts and gray-haired retirees. This is not the scenario at Casa Fuente at the Forum Shops in Caesars Palace, oh quite the contrary. At Casa Fuente the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. And while the selection is limited to actual Fuente family produced cigars Montesino, Ashton, etc, the entire Fuente line is available. Including the above mentioned God of Fire, Double X, all the Hemingways, and the exclusive Casa Fuentes sold only at the store. The best is after purchasing your Arturo, you venture out of store sit at the bar or at the caf \ u00e9 tables order up a round of mojitos or cuba libres, pull out your cigar and light up....ahhhhh sit and watch all the people go buy. Draw deep on the Dominican beauty in one hand and exhale, and then take a sip of your adult beverage in the other. Life is pretty good at this point. Not to mention the reactions of those who may double take, then realize ""Oh yeah we're in Vegas, it's okay"". Pricey perhaps, but it's about the total experience. ",0,0,0,1,0

 [This is part of a set of reviews covering establishments my family and I encountered while taking a road trip to Cincinnati.] I'm finally getting to the final few reviews from my trip more than two months ago. I guess I could have scrapped these last few, but that's not what Yelpers do. Is it!? This was your typical Courtyard by Marriot. Clean, well-run, friendly staff. They have a good-sized pool and a big, comfortable lobby. There were quite a few people checking in at the same time I was (the young lady at the front desk seemed a bit frazzled, but still very professional) and I was surprised how much room there was given the limited space they had cordoned off for registration. I would complain about the fact that there were only two elevators at either end of the hotel, but for this size hotel it didn't make sense to add more. It gave the feeling that we were waiting a long time because we had only one option, but that was probably just skewed because of my impatience of wanting to get to where I was going that night. I did take the stairs a few times when I didn't want to wait and going up and down to the third floor was surprisingly un-strenuous. They had enough room that the staircase was very shallow. Actually, a very unusual setup. I was a little disappointed in the morning when we were trying to get breakfast. Like the first Marriot we stayed on the outbound part of our trip, there were waffle makers, but these weren't self-serve. There was an area for a ""chef"" to make you eggs/omelette, but there was no one manning the station. Granted, it was early. But still. If you're going to have a station like that, shouldn't there be *someone* there? Even with that, we had a nice stay. Comfortable and restful before the drive home. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We came to Firefly to celebrate my fiance's birthday while on a one-night trip to Vegas. It was my first time at this type of restaurant. We started off with the sparking sangria, and proceeded to order half of the menu to share among 4 people. The food was great, but service was a bit slow. The server didn't offer any recommendations, which seemed odd since the menu is long, and it's a popular place. Unfortunately, 50% of our party came down with salmonella poisoning a day later. My fiance was very ill for 10 days and lost over 14 pounds. I was lucky, and didn't get sick. We aren't sure why, but I didn't have any of the seafood dishes, so perhaps it was something there.

 This place is awesome. It's a nice chill spot after getting off work late and hanging out with friends. I love most of their warm milk teas, especially the almond milk tea. Actually, I pretty much like all of their milks teas, cold and warm. The staff pretty much leaves you alone except when you first get there (which is understandable). Their tactics for getting you to order instantly is a little intimidating I will admit. They just stand behind you until you're ready to order -_- I like how they place all of the teas on the shelves for everyone to see. It adds color and ambience to the place. I am already a regular and will continue to be one. Side note: I was iffy about coming here the first time because one of my close friends told me that she came here and hated it. She ordered regular boba drinks (not totally sure which ones) and almost all of her friends puked. My experience was nothing like this. ",0,0,0,1,0

 So glad we stumbled upon this place. It was our last night ""out"" in Scottsdale for a brief vaca and I wasn't in the mood to go crazy. Its dark and cozy with casual live music and a fantastic wine list (almost too big as we couldn't sort our way through fast enough). I'm kicking myself because I can't remember our server's name but he was superb as well. We inquired about some birthday shots being taken at the adjacent table. He informed us it was their house shot and gave us a couple to try on the house. It was delish so if you're in a shot-taking-kinda-mood, inquire and you shall receive. The other thing to know is that this joint is considered a speakeasy. The door way is not facing the street but is in a breezeway behind the building and the windows are painted so those passing by can not see in. I love this concept but wish it was like some more authentic places I've been to where you need to be on a list or have a password to get in. Not a big deal and they obviously don't do that so more people can join and bring in $$ but I just think it would make it even more cool. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Staff just seem burnt out. The customer service is really lacking. They really have no concern in their customer loyalty or keeping customers coming back. The facility is sometimes clean, and sometimes not. The water last week looked disgusting, it looked ""thick"", I can't describe it any other way. The play area toys are grimy, more often than not. But I decided to write a review after this experience: They were using our instructor during our 30minute private lesson to train new staff. He spent most of the time talking to this new staff about how to instruct. When we said something to the staff after about 10 minutes, 1/3 of this lesson, was already wasted. Then, it took a few minutes to sort it out. Now we'd wasted 15 minutes of a 30 minute lesson. This was the first lesson since we have been back where my son was back to being comfortable and attentive in the water and it was wasted on training their own staff. He was off jumping around on the platform and playing. He basically got a 10 minute lesson because they usually play with water toys the last 5min, as a reward for listening. The playing is fine. But I am not okay with spending $42 on a 10 minute lesson. I would also have preferred that they informed me of the training in advance, as I would have known there would be wasted time and then would have rescheduled my lesson....sneaky sneaky bad customer service. The worst part? When the staff started scrambling around after we informed them about the lack of attention during our private lesson...we asked that he stop training during our lesson...the person I am assuming is a manager or owner came out of the office and once she heard what was going on, she hid in the back offices and did not say anything to us. I mean, a manager should have AT LEAST apologized on behalf of the business and the RIGHT thing to would have been to reschedule us for a new lesson. Nope, nothing. Our instructor is good, Adam, which is why we return. And we have now signed up for a bunch of lessons coming up so we will see that through. We are looking for a new school after that. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Wow. Just awful. Easily the worst meal during a weekend in Montreal, where the food is, on average, really great. Onion soup was incredibly bland. Watery and tasteless. Three people in my party got it and none of us finished even a quarter of it. For the entree, I ordered a pizza. Oh man. All of the ingredients came straight from a can and were clumped in weird bunches across the surface of the pie. The olives were barely drained and the crust was overly doughy. The waitress seemed to mean well but she didn't seem to understand how bad the food was there. And so she seemed annoyed at our lack of enthusiasm for the place. The management is responsible for the poor quality of this place, not the poor waitress who served us. The only thing it has going it is the location as it is in the middle of a popular part of town. We should have learned our lesson as soon as we walked in as it wasn't very crowded. ",1,0,0,0,0

 nothing really wrong with the food, nothing really good either. my biggest complaint is the price: $12.99 for dinner. included in the dinner price is your choice of soup; I chose the hot and sour. weirdest hot and sour I've ever had. it isn't that it tasted bad, but seemed like it was made by someone who had no idea what hot and sour soup was. it was mostly thin strips of carrots in a light broth. not a bad flavor, but not hot and not sour, that's for sure. the dinner was also supposed to include a greater selection of ingredients. I don't know if it did since I've never eaten there for lunch, but I saw shrimp and scallops listed on the website, and the only seafood present was some suspicious looking kind of whitefish. you also get to choose from pork, beef, sausages, everything frozen and hard as a rock. then, a small choice of noodles (3, I think) a good choice of veggies and a lot of sauces. now, here's my real problem with this place: it's basically a buffet, except nothing is cooked until you order it, and your only choices are noodle dishes. you get a fairly small bowl, put a few pieces of meat in it, then some noodles, then you've got room for a few veggies. then, choose your sauce and wait in line to hand it over to the cooks. avoid this place like the plague if they are even remotely busy. on a Saturday evening I had to stand in line waiting to fix up my bowl, as people just shuffle through line like zombies, then stand and wait to hand your bowl over to the cooks, then stand and wait until it is cooked. sit down and spend a few minutes eating, get back up and repeat the process. I spent more time standing in line than I did eating. and again, the food wasn't bad, but I think $7.99 is a fair price for what you get, $12.99 is criminal. a lot of good Chinese buffets charge around $10 for the dinner buffet, and many also include a Mongolian grill. it's not this big, but for less money they also include egg rolls, much better soup, salads, rice, chicken dishes, beef dishes, pork dishes, sushi....you get the point. here, you get noodle bowls, that's it.

Its not a fast food counter ladies grow a personality. I order a whiskey neat and get ice. Okay take a bartending class too. Finally, don't play SEC football west of the Mississippi.

 Perhaps it was my point of reference from a recent trip to the East Coast, but Brit & Chips did not live up to the reviews. I was disappointed by the sole with the sour cream and onion batter. The quality of the ingredients from Brit & Chips were questionable. I was overwhelmed by the grease and underwhelmed by the lack of freshness of the fish. The sole was also overcooked. The chips were slightly soft and not as crispy as fries could be. On a more positive note, the waitress was very hospitable. Both of the wait staff were very friendly and patient with our indecisiveness. ",0,1,0,0,0

 so obviously im a man and i am not a metro so my review is limited but i enjoyed going to polished. my fiance basically kept begging that i went there with her so i finally did and got my first man pedicure. as soon as we walked in it the staff treated us like we were regulars and have treated us the same way since. i find this very rare in today's society and i wish more companies were like that. they had lots of massage chairs, there was no wait and they kept bringing me beer and wine so for $25 it was well worth it and very relaxing. we have since gone once a month...obviously making my fiance very happy.

 This place honestly doesn't understand the concept of service.

 This was my first time at First Friday. A friend of mine came to visit and I took her there along with a few friends. We parked at the El Cortez and took the free shuttle across the street of the main entrance to the event. There were a lot of people of all ages kids as well wasn't expecting them to be out late. There were art galleries ofcourse, vendors, food trucks of all sorts and one of them had funnel cakes. There were 2 or 3 stages playing music. One of the stage was set up on top of a truck.. An area with rap music where a girl was rapping. Lots of neat art stuffs. We took the open top Big Bus back to El Cortez and sat on the top level of the bus which was so cool.

 Honestly I really wanted to love this place. It's very kitschy and super bright inside!! The menu was on the small side but it seemed to have all the tex mex options represented. I would really love to get ONE good tex mex restaurant in the area but this one is not it. First of all they don't have a hot salsa option, not really. Their salsa was okay pretty standard fair, my roommate makes better at home. I ordered a chicken burrito and I'm going to be honest their was like no chicken in my burrito it was mostly filler (beans). The pricing is pretty cheap considering where the restaurant is located so I guess you get what you pay for. I hear they have some kind of nacho buffet and some other things so I may give this place another shot once they've had a chance to be in business a little longer. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was seeking a new Dentist because my current one stopped offering nitrus. I haven't had any dentist/hygenist work on my mouth without nitrus for over 30 years! When I arrived at Pinnacle Peak Dentistry, I was warmly welcomed and thanked for selecting their practice. I was introduced to my hygenist, Jackie and I immediately felt comfortable. She said she could use nitrus but explained that, for years, she used a topical ointment that would eliminate any discomfort and assured me she was thorough but gentle. I am not saying I wasn't nervous but I felt absolutely no pain or discomfort. When Dr. Clayton came in, he have my mouth a thorough examination and explained areas where I should be more diligent - again, he was warm and welcoming. I can't say enough about Dr. Clayton and his team. While I never look forward to visiting the Dentist, I won't be as hesitant when I return for my next visit in April. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I give 3.5 to 4 stars for food. But for service, it is probably a 2-star or less for me. SERVICE: Being Chinese, I know service is never the forte of an authentic Chinese restaurant. But I was still surprised at the lack of service and the total carelessness and cluelessness there. First, they don't seem to care which table orders what so the orders frequently got mixed up when I was there; the server would carry the food and wander around from table to table, asking if anyone ordered this. So I had to watch the plates whenever the server carried them out from the kitchen and stopped her to give mine to me, because the server was walking AWAY from me with my food on her tray. Second, they started making dumplings 40 minutes after I ordered them. After the dumplings were finally ready, because they forgot who ordered it or simply did not care to check, they let it sit on the side table behind the cashier for another 15 minutes. Our dumplings were finally uncovered when the owner saw the dumplings sitting in the cashier area and started talking loudly in Chinese, ""Whose dumplings are these?"" I had to raise my hand to claim them. So we got our dumplings after we finished our meal and were about to pay the bill. Third, it was difficult to get hold of a server/owner to ask if the dish was coming out anytime soon. They rushed by your table and never made any eye contact. They don't come by your table and fill your water diligently, or check on your order. The owner was especially warm and hospitable to her acquainted clientele when I was there, but was quite indifferent to others (I guess I shouldn't be surprised how they selectively treat people... in the Chinese way). FOOD: In terms of food, I don't have major complaints. The food was good, quite authentic, and fairly priced. But if you ask me to compare Chou's Kitchen to the street food I had growing up in China, Chou's does not come close in taste and quality. We ordered (1) Spicy Braised Beef Combination (in Chinese, ""sliced lung by the married couple,"" a dish in chili oil, toasted peanuts, and cilantro with a mixture of beef slices and various beef parts, including stomach--it sounds gross but I dare you to try it). The best dish we got that night. To me, it was not spicy enough because it is traditionally a very hot dish from Sichuan Province. But the flavor was there and I was thrilled to see a dish Chinese restaurants in the U.S. don't normally serve, even though this is a STANDARD appetizer in almost any restaurant in China. (2) Lamb skewer. Pretty disappointed. It has the similar cumin rub as the ones I would buy from the Xinjiang Uyghur vendors on a street cart in China. But the quality of the lamb was so bad and almost inedible: it was predominantly fat and connective tissues, and the very small amount of lean meat was tough and overcooked. (3) Fried beef buns (in Chinese, ""water-fried beef buns""). So-so. Too much dough for my liking and too little filling. Also, not juicy enough. (4) Soybean Paste Noodle (a soupless ""mix-it-yourself"" cold noodle with cubed ham, sliced cucumber, and a soybean meat sauce). It was extremely basic. The noodle was an alkaline noodle, so it was yellower and more elastic than the average soup noodles. It was a filling dish, but nothing special, and quite bland. (5) Dumplings with Pork and Napa Cabbage. Yes these are the dumplings that came grossly late so we had to box all of them. For 5 bucks they were great, much better than the ones from the frozen section at a Chinese grocery store. But they were NOT worth the 1.5+ hour wait. I would recommend this dish to people who like homemade Chinese dumplings because they are delicious, not because they are the watery relatives of potstickers. But if they don't come at the end of your meal, you should probably cancel the order. All in all, it was a decent Chinese eatery with some management/service issues. I saw some items on the menu that I don't usually see elsewhere and they are quite good. But still, these are basic, entry-level Chinese food items that are quick to prepare and hard to mess up. I would probably come back and hope to see an improvement in the structureless service. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The decor was lovely...drinks were fab. Wasn't particularly crazy about the menu. Had been hearing such wonderful things, but was slightly disappointed. I love fancy food, but just didn't find anything small that sounded appetizing and didn't have pork or an expensive price tag that I felt was worth it. I did try the lobster mac and cheese, which was quite tasty! The service was great though. Nice spot for friends to hang out or a date. But I would stick to drinks only.

 The only plus was the oyster bar which tasted amazing and I will be writing a separate review for. The rooms were definitely cheap looking and the fridge was leaking and unplugged when I got there. Maybe it was defrosting? Hah, not sure. But we didn't end up using it. The shower water temp is flippant I expect due to toilet flushing from other rooms etc. It would go hot to cold to warm and never hot again. Internet wifi not free. There's no elevators. Everything in the courtyard rooms will need to be brought up the stairs. The rooms are some distance from the entrance. Walking through the casino to the rooms, it was passed the bingo hall and looked like we were walking into the mirrors at the end. Very trippy. Being on the north end, it's still far from strip, even to the stratosphere and riviera. I would have paid the extra bucks to stay on the strip since taking the taxi cost just as much. They do offer shuttles to fashion show mall and airport but I never figured out where the drop off/pick up station was since I was told it was off in the corner outside. And Vegas in the winter time doesn't offer you time to kindly round the corners to find the right one. Nahhhhh. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Solid pizza joint in the Miracle Mile shops (near Planet Hollywood and Hilton Elara). I've eaten there 3 separate times when in Vegas. Friendly employees. The pizza is a thin pizza, not a thick pan pizza. The strombolis are great. You can get free refills on your soda but you have to ask because it's behind the counter. The prices are steep, but that's to be expected for the location. $37 for a large pizza to go. ",0,0,1,0,0

 hmmm...fun! sporadic!! energetic!? none of the above. BUT - lovely quiet property. really good food altho the orgasmatron went off only for the tiramisu. GENIUS. I'm a total tiramisu snot ball so if it stinks I don't want it. The lovely Lauren, our waitress recommended it and said if I didn't like it it was on her and I could have the blueberry marscarpone cheesecake instead. Either way I was winning...didn't have to trade off. It was the right amount in a delightful not-too-sweet- chocolate cup. Yummmmm. Oh so you want to know about dinner? I started with the Dungeness crab salad. Nice, light, interesting mix of flavors which I liked very much but left me feeling like something was missing. For dinner I had the seared ahi appetizer - I know, done everywhere but I really just felt like a small portion of nice fish. It was that. Again, good but no wow factor. Perfect for what I wanted but I wished it had more umph. Service was great - it was a slow Monday. Wine list is a budget killer and a bit more manageable by the glass. We weren't rushed and overall a very nice experience and meal. I'd most certainly go back. yeah, go. ",0,0,0,1,0

 They need to take out about 4-5 of the tables they have packed in this place - Way to crowded. Not to mention there was a guy singing and playing an accordion on the night we went for dinner. Would have been fine except for the fact that there are 10 people too many in the place to begin with and then he wanders around the dining floor going table to table. Wanted to pay the guy to stop for 30 min while I ate! Pasta dishes are way overpriced and honestly not that great. $20 for noodles and meat sauce... Dinner specials/entrees are your best bet and were very good. but also way over prices. Didn't have desert but multiple people in my dinner party raved about one of the cakes they had. Simply put - this place does not execute the level of food their price points represent. I'm all for paying for a good meal but when it falls short.... and this place does!

 We kind of got jacked around from the start - there were four of us, and we reserved a room with two queen beds. When we got to our room, our suitcases were waiting for us in a room that had one king-sized bed and one couch. Calling down to the front desk immediately, the conversation went kind of like this - Us: we were not given the room we reserved. We would like you to remedy the situation. Them: we gave you a complimentary upgrade. [Translation: Either there are not any rooms with two queen beds available or we are too lazy to find any]. You're welcome for upgrading your room. Us: I'm sorry, this is not going to work. Let me talk to someone who understands words. After being passed to three people, we found someone who understood the situation and we finally were given the correct room. But without a fridge - I couldn't believe it! And one remote for two TVs. Hmm. I never actually slept in the bed all weekend, but it looked comfortable. The two showers were nice, and there was a massive sink area, another plus. The hotel itself was larger than some small towns. It was immense. By the end of the weekend though, I could easily maneuver it. Bonus - the casino didn't smell over-perfumey or smell like smoke, which was nice since I walked through it frequently (but didn't gamble). There were lots of bathrooms everywhere, another plus since you're drinking lots (of water) since it's so dry in Vegas. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I stumbled on this place because it was close to my hotel while I was on business. I couldn't believe my luck! Everything I ordered was delicious. I ordered the citrus spare ribs, which were so good that I ate the leftovers at the airport the next morning (that's saying something, for a business traveler!), and the lemongrass noodle soup, which was so generously portioned (and packed perfectly for takeout so the noodles didn't get mushy) and amazingly flavorful! The broth was to die for and I'm usually a little underwhelmed by pho broth. I also went a little crazy and ordered the autumn rolls, which were fresh and tasty.

 Baja Miguel's has been a local favorite of our family for about 7 years and we've been steady customers. We've always enjoyed the food for the value and we've referred countless friends to the restaurant. We ate there tonight for an early Father's Day celebration. We were shocked to learn that when we requested more chips and salsa, we'd be charged $7.95 for the next round. Huh? Then my mom requested a little extra lettuce with her taco and she was informed that would cost $1.75. At that we asked for the manager. We have never incurred such charges before and the manager, who was not the regular manager we're accustomed to dealing with, told us they have been charging for those items for a long time. Wrong! We have never once been charged for extra chips and salsa or for a little extra lettuce. Although we enjoyed our meals, to the tune of $80 with tip for 4, I don't think we'll be coming back here any time soon. I understand times are tough, but come on! We're not the type of folks who complain about paying money for decent food and we tip well. But when a restaurant starts being so tight about every little item, it takes the fun out of going there. Too bad. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This place is a MUST-GO while you're in Vegas. It's located inside Planet Hollywood and across from Rockbar, Fat Tuesday, and a Batman arcade game area. Sometimes the line looks long, but don't let that be deceiving. They are very efficient and it will be worth the wait, trust me. I've had the Earl's Club, Italian, and Full Montagu. I hear their cobb wraps are just as good. Their sandwiches are about $6, which is the best cheapest thing you can get in Vegas for an amazing hot sandwich. I make a stop here at least twice on every Vegas trip I've made. Earl's is too irresistible. At one point, Earl's was my breakfast/lunch/dinner/post-club food @ 6AM.

 0 stars. Whatever you do, avoid this shuttle service at all cost!!! This was the first and only shuttle that I found coming out of the United terminal, and it seemed reasonable at only $6 each way. I decided to prepay for the return trip. I have to say that the trip from the airport was uneventful. I was able to get right on a waiting shuttle that was pretty much already full, so we left right away and arrived at the Vdara after only a couple of other stops. The return trip, however, was another story... All of the shuttle services require that you call the day before departure to schedule a pickup time. We had an 11:30 am departure, so when I called they scheduled our pickup for 9:00 am. We got up a bit late having stayed up until 3:00 am and rushed through our breakfast so that we would not miss our pickup. We waited. At 9:10, still no shuttle. I call them and am told that the driver had a couple more pickups and would likely arrive in 7 to 10 minutes. 9:20, still no shuttle. During this time, mind you, we see several shuttles arrive / depart from other services. 9:30 still no shuttle. Another person waiting right beside us asks if we are waiting for Executive Las Vegas. Apparently he is too and has placed a couple of calls and was told the same thing...the shuttle should be arriving in 5 minutes. I call again at 9:40, am placed on hold, and then get disconnected. At 9:50, an Executive Las Vegas towncar arrives, apparently to pickup the person that was sitting next to us. We tell the driver that we have been waiting for 50 minutes as well, and he says that he was only told to pickup one person. We practically have to force our way into the towncar as well, otherwise who knows how long we would have ended up waiting. As several other reviewers have stated, do yourself a favor and avoid the lousy service at Executive. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The sweet ladies at Linh's saved my wedding day! I got fitted for my wedding dress in Huntington Beach 1 month before the wedding day. I lost 5 lbs by the time I picked it up 2 days before I was suppose to leave for Vegas. The bodice was too loose...and made me look bigger/wider then i really am. Mind you, it cost me over $200 to shorten the dress and add a bushel at Davids Bridal...There was no way I was going to spend more money on alterations there (although the seamstress at DB did a great job). I couldn't justify spending any more monry on my dress. I did an online search for same-day alterations in Vegas and found Linhs. I was worried because some people said it wasn't as cheap as the tailors in OC... and I was quoted $120 to tighten the bodice of (another) dress at a dingey tailor in Little Saigon. I called Linhs 4 days before my wedding. The lady asked me to call back in 5 mins because she was with a costumer. I ended up getting second thoughts about altering the dress and did not call back. But I guess they had my # on caller ID and they called me back anyway! I am SO glad they did!!!! I brought my dress in at 10am the day before my wedding. The shop was bright and clean with several employees. To take in the bodice they quoted me $30!!!! I was SHOCKED! For same day service! DB charged $40 just to RUSH an alteration. After further inspection they saw my dress had 3 layers and told me it would be $40 (not $30). It was still such an amazeballs deal. I was grinning from ear to ear. They told me it would be ready by 5 and if it still didn't fit, they would fix it before they close at 6. They ended up being ready at 2! Thank you so much!!!! My wedding was perfect and my dress looked BEAUTIFUL! Thank God for the ladies at Linh's! Ill upload photos of the finished product. ",0,0,0,0,1

They didn't take our order, they were short with us and the SECOND I cashed out, they through down the ""reserved for gamers"" sign on my machine. I'm sure they won't even care about this review. Why would they? The staff is getting tipped from all of the old gamers... Who are we? The location in the Four Queens is closer anyway. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I just recently went in to replace a broken iPhone. I worked with Robert and Christina and they couldn't have been more helpful. On my first visit, Robert asked questions to determine my needs and than made a recommendation that would suite me and my needs best. He went above and beyond to help me and got me on my way quick. I ended up with an issue with the device a few days later and called to speak with Robert. I appreciated that the call was quickly routed without having to press a lot of options. I spoke with Christina who was professional and willing to help. I stopped in later and Both Robert and Christina took care of me and made the process easy and painless. I appreciate their help and the service they provided. Best customer service I've received in along time!!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Vegas ... how do you choose a restaurant? I think most of them are really pretty average for the outrageous prices (and I don't mind spending money on food - as long as it's good). My husband was immediately put off by the 10 minute wait for the waiter to get our wine order. I'm okay with a slow dinner, but if you're not, pay attention. The wine list was decent, nothing special. The wine my husband chose (even though I am usually the wine-chooser) was gone, so the waiter did a substitute for us that was okay. We had some oysters - they were $3 in the menu, but he informed us that they had just jumped to $4 because they were bigger (I'd hate to see what they were before, these were not large by any means). He had the tomato soup, which came with mini grilled cheese, he loved it. I had a filet mignon, cooked just fine, but wasn't that tender. He had the Tomahawk rib-eye, which was decently flavored. The sides were nothing special at all. Overcooked asparagus, mashed potatoes that need the sauce they served the steak with (first clue: steak needs no sauce if it is truly stellar). He had the mac 'n cheese, I am anti-cheese, but he liked it. The service was merely okay. If I am paying this much, I want a server with some charisma, though. This one lacked it. We didn't bother with dessert, it was just too ordinary of a restaurant for a $280 bill for 2. Go elsewhere for your money. ",0,1,0,0,0

 J Crew is the proverbial mixed bag. Maybe I'm spoilt. When I lived in the Philadelphia area, the King of Prussia team was exceptional. They knew the true art of selling, which is establishing a connection and offering a variety of choices. Perhaps the Scottsdale store is simply understaffed or the people aren't invested in their jobs. I am not certain what it is. Every time I have visited--and I like to give a store several times to wow me--the employees are rushing around or chatting amongst themselves, just at two extremes. No one seems very happy to be there. At the end of both extreme is faulty customer service. There is no sense of urgency or even of building. Grab a shirt and you might wander around with it for a long time before someone wants to put it on the fitting room door. The only time you do draw attention is when you scoop up a bunch of items, and then, the associates seem to be wanting to fight for the sale. I love me some J. Crew, no doubt. They are classic and yet current. I would love shopping here more if the Scottsdale store could shore up their level of service with what the KOP location is doing. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is my husband and I's favorite restaurant. We go to this Kona almost every week. We've only experienced nothing but good things. There was only one time when one of my sushi rolls came out pretty pathetic but our server was right on it and sent it back to have it remade. The manager comped our drinks for us. We returned again the other night and the same manager gave us a complimentary dessert.

 So I wouldn't normally drive all the way to Cave Creek for anything but we had the week off, I had to go to Desert Ridge, and I saw this place in the Phoenix Magazine. Needless to say, save the gas. The place is cute on the inside and really had a lot of promise. The sides all sounded good and I couldn't decide between the pulled pork or the brisket so I got both. Added a side of potato salad and a side of beans. Where to begin? The pork wasn't bad but it wasn't bbq. I mean, it didn't taste smokey or sweet. It tasted boiled...and that's nasty. It was fatty and generally just lacking flavor. The bbq sauce they put on the thing was decent but they didn't have any of it out for me to get more. What they did have were ""regular"" and ""spicy"" bbq sauces. Both were thin, both were a bit spicy, and neither was up to the task of fixing this pork. The brisket was really a disaster. It was cut like ham slices. Really thick with a big hunk of fat around the outside that I had to remove from each slice. This whittled my beef down to medallion sized bits. The taste was fine but the thick texture, lack of bbq sauce, and fatty presentation was all disappointing. The beans were okay but I expected sweeter. BBQ baked beans, in my mind, should be sweet and savory. These, like everything else here, were just bland and dull. I tried mixing some of the runny bbq sauce available but it really didn't help. The saving grace was the potato salad. This was some of the best stuff I've ever had. I would totally buy a pound of that to bring to a dinner party. They should package it and sell it in the stores. Really it was creamy and sweet without overpowering the potato flavor. Good stuff and well executed. Will not be going back here. Too bad too because it had a lot of promise. Oh well. There is no shortage of bbq in the valley. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The only place I had a shawarma was in Kuwait so I don't have much to compare it to. I will say, the shawarma I had here was a lot different but not in a bad way. It was actually really good, just different. The order came with 2 sides and I chose rice for both. Sides were small. I ended up with more meat than rice. I had to get take out because of my daughter but the environment itself looked like something I can enjoy with my wife. It was $13! Ouch. Over priced in my opinion and that is the reason for the - 1 star. Hope to find other shawarma places that can compete. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I Love Yogurt is a very reasonably priced yogurt place with tons of 80s themed chachkis. In addition to flavors and taste that rival most of the other mainstream yogurt places, you get to check out a genuine MR. T cereal box and a Ghostbusters proton pack!

 For under $8 (in South Park, that's nothing), I was served two eggs, two potato pancakes, three pancakes and three turkey sausage links. I went for lunch on election day 2010 and though the place was packed, our party of two was seated immediately. The eggs were decent; nothing special. The potato pancakes were pretty good, but not the best I've had. The turkey sausage and pancakes, on the other hand, were the best I've had in Charlotte. In my experience, turkey sausage is just something that restaurants keep on hand to please their selective customers (again, this is South Park we're talking about), but I actually feel like the Original Pancake House cared about the quality of even their more obscure ingredients. As for the pancakes, they were simply the best I've had, which says a lot considering I'm not a huge fan of pancakes in general. This filling lunch was well worth my $8. The best breakfast restaurant I've been to around the Quail Commons area where I work. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Another yummy meal at Bouchon. I've been to the original in Yountville years ago and to this one as well about 2 years ago. They did it again, although I must say that my previous visit had a bit of an edge on this one. Maybe it was because last time I was part of a party of 10, therefore able to sample a wide variety of foods. Also, last time I had the lovely foie gras terrine which was CREAMY, RICHNESS, CLOG YOUR ARTERIES DELICIOUSNESS! I couldn't order it this time since there were only 2 of us and both of us would have had instant heart attacks if I had! So back to this visit: Started off with a half dozen of my favorite creamy oysters from the Northwest, is there a better way to begin a meal? I had the duck breast which was the perfect ratio of fat to juicy meat and I, unlike some of you yelpers, enjoyed the orange sauce that accompanied it! It is duck a la orange after all...The special peeky-toe crab salad was excellent, even if it was on the miniscule side. And the classic chicken was simply cooked to perfection. Yes, the bread here is near perfection and we ate every last bite of it! Finished with the three bites of brownies with tin dollops of mint, chocolate, and carmel ice cream-the perfect ending. Only complaint here was that the restaurant was not that busy, so it took away from the usual energy of the place. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Well I LOVE this hotel (Cosmopolitan) so I researched restaurants to pick one for lunch. All I needed to see was ""Bamboozled shakes"" with alcohol and my decision was easy!!! Went with the ""Drunkin monkey"" because it had my FAV frangelico!! I'm sure it has about 1000 calories, but hey... You know what they say, ""what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas""... So let's hope that includes calories too!!! I also had the ""machete"" burger. Chili peppers, garlic sauce, YUM!! Then all the usual choices for side items like onion rings, sweet potatoe fries or regular fries. It was all amazing so now I need to go back to try one of everything else on the menu! I especially liked that they had so many other options other than burgers! Turkey, chicken, salmon and lamb!! Something for everyone!! ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is the best group of doctors I have ever gone to. Our doctor is Michael Levin but we have also seen Dr. Marcy Kulic and Dr. Susan Lee. They are very thorough and always take their time. Their priority is definitely their patients. They are open 7 days a week for well and sick visits. One time when my daughter was sick, Dr.Levin personally called me on a Saturday to make sure she was doing ok. Another time, we thought my son had strep throat and Dr.Kulic called me at 6:30 p.m. on Sunday night to let us know that the test results from that afternoon came back positive and called in a prescription for the medication. They always remember the small details and provide excellent care. I would recommend them to anyone. ",0,0,0,0,1

 The guys here at DCG have some serious passion for the Coney Dog and the action they have going on is pretty cool as well. Inside is full of fun items to make you feel like you're back in the Detroit area and then some. Take your time and check out the walls. I've never been to Michigan but do love THE DOG. Been here a couple times and usually order a couple of their famous Coney Combos. Even broke down and had to test out some of the Chili Cheese Fries. Nice! Really like the way the Dog pops in your mouth as you bite into them. The Hand Cut Fries are made fresh to order and you can definitely tell the difference. They also have Burgers, Pitas, Salads and boneless Chicken Wings as well. The food is pretty good and most people seem to rate this place rather high. I'm inclined to go with an A-OK since the Chili or Coney sauce just did not have much of a thrill factor or flavor profile for me and the hotdogs are little on the pricey side. Give them a try and see what you think. This is one of those regional flavors that you are going to enjoy more if you are from that area. I tend to lean toward the Windy City when hankering for a special treat. BEEP BEEP! 3.5 STARS ",0,0,1,0,0

 Hidden gems of creamy snowy ice!! The ribbons on delicious snow are so much better than regular shave ice from Japan or Hawaii. The best part is that when it melts you aren't left with a bunch of melting ice, but instead a creamy ice cream like goodness! You also get complimentary strawberry or regular condensed milk or chocolate/caramel syrups as a topping. They offer a punch card as well. The guy there was so nice and was very friendly.

 Located in the Fremont hotel and casino, this place is tucked behind the Tony Roma's. The entrance is so plain and small, you could easily walk past it. There are about 20 tables inside and it's darkly lit. We had the stuffed pork chops, the T-Bone Steak and Salmon Florentine with Gorgonzola. The pork chop was presented well, but over cooked.

 Whenever I get to Phoenix, I always stop by for some bread. I went there at 10:20 am to pick up some fresh bread. The young girl behind the counter told me they weren't open until 11. I told her I just wanted some bread, it was siting right there. She again told me no. I asked for the manager. A young female manager came out and basically told me that she couldn't sell me the bread. I asked her if was against the law or something and then she said the ""drawer"" wasn't out yet. I explained again that I just wanted some bread, not a sandwich or anything else. She again told me no. Obviously this woman manager and the counter girl should not be employed in a retail/sales environment. And, since they obviously don't need or want my money I won't be back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I came to Charlotte from for business matters and stayed at this hotel. Walking distance access to stores near the hotel were nonexistent. The hotel lobby decor had a red, black, and white color theme. There was also a pool table that people waiting there can get a quick game going. Upon my arrival here, the front desk was not really busy as I thought. So check in here was fairly quick. I took the elevator to my room and proceeded to walk down the hallway. The lighting in the hallways seemed dimmed and visibility was not that great. When I walked into my room, it was nicely decorated with the hotel's theme. Downside, the room lacked lighting. The view from my room was just the back of the hotel, which was not much. Well I can't complain for the price that I paid for the room. It was an OK hotel. I was always out and about anyways. The hotel staff was fairly accommodating. A negative that happend was getting hung up on by a staff member calling the front desk.

 2.5 Stars I share the sentiment with my fellow Yelpers on The Golden Spoon on its decline of quality. I first found The Golden Spoon in Carlsbad, CA about 8 years ago. They then infiltrated the valley with many many stores which made me happy with our favorite place for Froyo at that time. After having a pretty good presence in the valley stores started to close for good. My six mile trek became traveling across town to get this awesome Froyo. The Golden Spoon to me is like one of those family members you look past their flaws because you're so fawn of them. Well my eyes are now open to the fact that their frozen yogurt no longer has the same great taste I remembered and this store is always dirty. As much as it pains me, I am not sure I will drive 26 miles one way to come here any longer. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This was the most badass Apple Store in the universe back when Apple stock wasn't worth $300 a share and a bevy of retail consultants hadn't convinced them to turn it into an Abercrombie-esque store-cum-gay-dance-club. (Latin cum, not slang cum.) A&F can get away with it because they sell two pieces of cloth sewn together. The Apple Store sells computers. And more importantly, the Apple Store repairs computers. When you can't talk to an employee about your repair/purchase without shouting over the music, your computer retail location has failed to meet its purpose. Couple that with the usual crowds that come with being Chandler Fashion Center and it's a disaster. Right at open's fine, right before close is fine; in between, abandon hope all ye he who enter here. It seriously took me an hour to buy a computer last time, even after giving up and waving my AmEx in the air like I just don't care.

 If you want to feel thin and beautiful, come stand in line and look at the people waiting here. Just kidding. Seriously though, this place attracts some people who should consider laying off the deep fried delicacies. This place was the first time in my life that I've had a fried Twinkie. Yet, somehow I feel like the people that I saw here regularly indulge. I don't think the hot dogs looked all that great. In fact, I would suggest skipping the savory items altogether, and going straight towards the dessert options. I give this shop props for scratching deep fried Twinkies off my bucket list. 99 cents for the Twinkie was a bargain. This sub-500 calorie treat was DELICIOUS. It was perfection: crunchy on the outside, melting and warm on the inside, and gloriously sweet with the generous pour of powdered sugar over it. The ecstasy lasted a few bites. Then, I started to feel the effects of my arteries clogging, which happened concurrently with my blood sugar spike. By the time I finished it, I regretted eating the whole thing. I would recommend sharing, lest you similarly experience glutton's remorse. At the end of the day, this little shack has: zero ambiance, Midwestern-esque clientele, mediocre savory items, but completely indulgent dessert options. What's not to love? ",0,0,0,1,0

 Sadly, I much prefer the Chompies in Chandler, AZ over the Scottsdale location. Having been to Scottsdale one three times and all three I have been let down but none more than today. Breakfast on Saturday at 10:30 AM. and surprisingly, or maybe not, we got a table for two immediately. Ray was our server and he immediately appeared with water and a very cheerful attitude. The menu here has A LOT to look at so we stated our drinks and he said he would return soon. After 15 minutes, he did return to take our order. Now maybe because my husband was looking at the menu the whole time but not to pick anything only to kill time. Ray walked past us several times in this 15 minutes (OK, I exaggerate, it was only 12 minutes) and never once looked at us to see if we were ready. Only when I asked for some help, did Ray return. I ordered the Fiesta Omelet. Bad choice. This was a pile of messy scrambled eggs with some black beans. I specifically ordered no onions or sour cream and got the no sour cream part but it was slathered in onions. Also, the menu states it comes topped with ranchero sauce and cheese and avocado - none of these items were found on the plate. I did ask for avocado and Ray stated, ""Oh, does it come with avocado?"" The meal was tasteless and after my annoyance of no cheese, hard to enjoy. We were ready to check out and again, I had to go get Ray and ask for our check. Usually, or it has been in the last several visits to Chompies, a manager stops by to see if all is OK. This time - nope. Not one because I would have stated the problem. Oh well... I'll just stick to the Chandler location now and won't order that omelet again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 There are too many good places to eat within the same price range for me to give this place a second shot. The staff was friendly and smiley, all the things you expect your hostess and waiter to be when you walk into a restaurant. The decor is nice. There is a beautiful red sculpture in the middle of the dinning room that I really liked. The booths are comfortable with good spacing. You're not sitting on top of the people next to you. They also have a patio that looked nice and an outdoor fireplace. I would sit outside on my next visit except I won't be going back. The food was less than awesome. The soup of the day was a really good cream of mushroom. Good consistency, great flavor. The salad was iceberg lettuce with a few cucumber slices and tomato wedges. Pretty standard house salad, decent vinaigrette. From there we split a lobster hoagie with arugula and paprika remoulade and the pan seared Pacific salmon with wild mushroom risotto. I substituted asparagus for the french fries that come standard with all the burgers/sandwiches. When the plate arrived in front of me, there were only 3 short, fat stalks on my plate which is a shame because I really love veggies.The risotto was the only other item worth mentioning or maybe it's just that I really like mushrooms. Anyway, the risotto was good, but not good enough to make up for everything that the other food lacked. The restrooms here are ridiculously small. The door to the stall opens inward so you literally have to step back between the toilet and the wall to pull the door back toward you. Seriously? I was wearing a skirt and the last thing I wanted was to accidentally touch my bare skin to the toilet bowl.

 Customer service/friendliness: 5 stars Efficiency/Time of Service: 3 stars Did they fix the problem?: 1-2 stars (??) The Gist: On a Saturday, the brakes on my 2009 Hyundai Genesis lost pressure about 2 blocks from The Brake Shop (TBS). Yelp tells me they're good and close by, so I go. Very nice guys in the front office and they get me right into service. Diagnosis: I'm told that my master brake cylinder needs to be replaced along with several brake pads and rotors. My oil change guys already told me I'd need to replace my brake pads soon, so that made sense. TBS tells me I need my power steering flushed too. I agree to it all. Questionable actions: TBS tells me that the master cylinder will need to be ordered. I decide to wait the extra two days for delivery (they are closed Sunday). On the day of completion, I'm called and told that everything is about 95% complete. Supposedly, my pedal and another system needs to be tuned by the dealership. However, the car is ""still driveable and safe."" I pick up the car and do notice increased pressure but still difficult to drive normally. I call them back to ask what to tell the dealership and TBS tells me that they COULD fix my car completely, but thought I wanted it out early. (huh?) Total amount spent at TBS: $1100.00 Dealership follow-up: My dealership tells me that my entire anti-lock brake system needs to be replaced. Luckily, it's under warranty, but still puts me at an additional weekend using a rental car. I eventually get my car back and my brakes are back to 100% normal. Total amount spent at dealership: $120 (including fully insured car rental for 4 days) Bottom Line: What started off as a seemingly easy repair job became a potential waste of time and money. I don't think I'll ever know if the repair by TBS was really necessary. The guys there were extremely nice and professional and made it look like I was getting a good deal. When I gave my CC over the phone, they stapled that note they took to show they weren't keeping my info. Real integrity or ignorant facade? ",0,1,0,0,0

 I feel I'm always the last person to try these new local spots. I can't believe how close this is and I'm just now getting around to trying it. I was back twice in one week, that says a lot. I was heading over to Julie T's place to see the new baby, and I needed to bring something, I was trying to be sneaky and surprise her (and then I saw she already wrote a review) so my plan was foiled. I originally had planned to get an entire coconut chiffon cake, but then decided to buy one of everything so that way we could all try a sample of each. Wow, when we opened the box of treasures, it was like opening a present. We all passed around the desserts, and all you could here was ""mmmmm"" and ""OMG"" we couldn't help ourselves. I really couldn't tell you what my favorite was, as they all were so good. I still thinking about the Mille-Crepe and the Yuzu Panna Cotta as well as the Mont Blanc. Surprisingly, the Green Tea Cake was my least favorite, just didn't get me like the rest of them did. Definitely coming back for the Kobocha pie and I need to try the crepes if I can get passed the other pastries first! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Have also tried Craft in New York and was very impressed. I had the NY Strip which was good, but the Rib Eye was unbelievable. We had a table of eight and were seated very promptly at the reservation time. Basic appetizers - arugla salad, caesar salad and oysters were all top notch. The sides were solid - hen of the woods mushrooms, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, etc. Overall a great steak experience. Craft is more of a modern and experimental experience, but Craftsteak is one of the best pure steak experiences I've had. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This is a great bar to drink at, and all that. But, unfortunately customer service matters. 10 days ago the ATM stole $100 from me. It debited my account twice for the $100 but never dispensed my money. 1 transaction was automatically reversed, the second wasn't. The next day I called the number on the front of the ATM and was informed they no longer process the transactions. FOR 10 days I have been leaving messages (5 total) for the manager Scott, with not one call back. Twice in person and 3 times on the phone, I have explained that I am just trying to find out who owns the machine and I can take it up with them. After 10 days with no phone call back, it is obvious this establishment does not care about its customers, only the bottom line at the end of the night. I will be taking my business to the other fantastic bars in the neighborhood from now on, including Soul, Jackalope Jacks, and Whiskey Warehouse. Customer beware, pay with cash and don't use the ATM.

 I've been getting lost and p.o.ed in this hotel since 1998. Even stayed here once out of desparation, much to my chagrin. All other properties in Vegas, including MGM properties, have signs clearly directing you to all the restaurants by name. A restaurant changes, they change the sign. But apparently Excalibur cannot be bothered. There's just a general sign at the escalator that says ""Restaurants"" implying that all the restaurants are upstairs. But they are not. Once you get upstairs, you'll find a couple of banners above the escalators that try to explain with oddly placed arrows where specific restaurants, registration, etc. are located. But the banners make no sense. It's so annoying. Also, this hotel was rundown in 1998 and is doubly so today. It smells funny. The smoke over the years has inflitrated every nook and cranny, making the whole place smell like a giant, nasty ashtray. Since it is part of the weird, circuitious path that allows you to traverse the Strip in mostly air conditioned comfort, sometimes it becomes a necessity to come here. Or if someone's band is playing here. Over the years, I've seen more live acts here for free than anywhere on the Strip. But otherwise I try to avoid it if at all possible. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I really liked my Thai iced tea and the donuts looked good (although the display case needed some TLC) but the girl who worked there had zero knowledge of product ingredients. I asked if the donuts had high fructose corn syrup because that ingredient always leaves a funky taste in my mouth and gives me a stomach ache. She didn't bother asking someone who knows and didn't go and check the ingredients. She did check the some of the drink ingredients to find they did indeed contain high fructose corn syrup. Thankfully they had the Thai Iced tea that was corn syrup free! I would suggest they have an ingredient list available for their customers who care about what they consume. Just because I desire a sweet treat doesn't mean I want to eat barely digestible ingredients! If I want a donut, I want it the good old fashioned way- made with SUGAR, same for my sweet beverages. A lot of business cut corners by using high fructose corn syrup assuming its the same as sugar when in fact it is very hard to digest and causes fatty liver and other awful health issues when regularly consumed, not to mention the taste is inferior to that of sugar. Also most corn syrup is genetically modified due to the GMO corn used to make it. I love a good Boba tea but I prefer patronizing a place that is ingredient conscious and has friendly, helpful and knowledgeable customer service. The girl working there seemed to be annoyed I even came in :( So much for donuts tonight, maybe next time.. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Beer is big in Charlotte. Heist Brewery might just be the biggest beer thing going (for now). Heist has taken the craft-brewery tasting room concept and blown it out into a full-scale restaurant and bar. The beer is decent (nothing special), but the food is the star here. Lots of unique dishes and healthy options--it's hard to decide what to eat. We came for an early dinner over Labor Day weekend and sat out on the deck (dog-friendly!) where a live band was playing. We were in a slightly hungover state so lots of fried stuff for us and it was all very tasty and in satisfying portions. Overall a great experience at Heist and looking forward to returning.

 I give one star because the only thing I ate that was good was the omelette. I mean you can't mess up a bacon and spinach omelette...can you? Everything else was disgusting, tasteless, bland, flavorless and just down right gross. I only tried this place because it was part of the runner perks for the Rock and Roll marathons, so it wasn't a first choice for buffet. Now I know where to NOT go. The ""waiters"" are not even waiters, they are just busboys. You have to grab your own drink, they don't even bring it for you, including sodas, teas, beer and drinks at the bar, you get yourself. All they do is pick up your plates. So basically its not too much service on their end. It's sad because there alot of food here, but they are all horrible. Pick another place!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Decided to give Planet Hollywood a try based on a recommendation from a friend. I'd have to say, apart from the Miracle Mile and Koi Japanese Steakhouse, this hotel really didn't wow me. I had a lot of hope for this hotel but it fell short of meeting my expectations. I thought the room was going to be modern, sleek and decked out with cool movie memorablia. Our movie items consisted of a shirt and a poster from the Murder in the First movie. The bathroom is outdated and the fixtures need replacement. Had to run the shower water for 5 minutes prior to getting in or the water was freezing. Plus side, the tub is huge and jetted. The bed is comfortable and my room overlooked the pool. Shops, restaurants, pools and shows right at your fingertips. Right across the street and adjacent to hotel are many options for shopping, gambling, shows and food. Great location but the room is not up to other Las Vegas 4-star hotel standards. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Gotham Bagels did finally get back to me, after we wrote a long letter with our complaints.

 This place wasn't gross, but it wasn't good. I honestly just got a ton of salad and ice cream. I'd be pissed if I spent the full price on it but my friend checked in on Foursquare so we got a buy-one-get-one voucher so it was like $30 for the two of us for dinner. I guess it was fun to try a buffet in Vegas but maybe my expectations were a little too high? I'd rather have spent twice that and had a real meal at a good restaurant.

 We gave this place a try b/c, well, Teakwoods has really been going downhill. What this place really lacks is an identity. We couldn't figure the place out. I had the Scorpion burger, which was really good. Fresh jalapenos, cooked perfectly, excellent bun. The chicken wings are good but aren't 'Buffalo' flavored -- more southwest flavored. Small beer selection, but they make up for that with the locals: Four Peaks and San Tan. Overall, not bad, more 'meh,' but didn't do enough (likely) to get us back there. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place has an awesome lunch deal: six wings and a slice of pizza for around $8. I've been here a few times and very satisfied every time.

 My boyfriend and I stayed at the Rio this past weekend. We chose to stay here in order to save a few bucks. Typically we like to stay at the Wynn or the Trump Towers. Anyway we checked into a non-smoking room that had a king size bed. The good news:The view was decent. It wasn't a strip view but we could see the Palms casino from where we were. The room was very spacious. It had a desk area and a living room area with a couch & coffee table. There was a mini-fridge, the windows were nice and large ( wall to wall), the tv had a swivel pull out shelf, there's 2 sinks in the bathroom area. One sink is in the vanity area and the other in the actual bathroom. The bad news: The walls are paper thin! I could hear every conversation happening in either of the neighboring rooms. The carpet had some fruit punch looking stains. The drapes didn't completely cover the windows so in the morning when the sun started to come up a sliver of light would shine through, but it was bright enough to wake us up. The vanity area was nice a spacious, but the tub is TINY! The door could practically hit the toilette it was so small in there. It was also out dated. The bed was also the most uncomfortable bed we've ever slept on. The springs practically came shooting out of the matress and left marks on our backs. The pillows were also very uncomfortable. The check in lines were insanely long. There were about 4 out of 8 stations with employees checking people in. We also tried the famous ""world buffet"" that they have there. There is a wide selection, but the quality is so-so and you're lucky if the servers remember you exist! It was almost impossible to get a refill on our drinks. Next time we will not skimp or try to save a few bucks. It's not worth it. ",0,1,0,0,0

As on par with any club/nightlife experience in Vegas, you'll be shelling out the big bucks. Again, I urge you to check FB/Twitter to find a promoter to guestlist you. If you are confirmed for guestlist. Get there early I mean EARLY, 9:30 PM early. This is the new kid in town. This club really needs to work on it's organization. Guest lists are everywhere.

 I have worked in a customer service job for four years and this was an absolute terrible customer service experience. First off, don't come here within the last 40 minutes of them being opened. Everything felt rushed. The lady at the register told myself and other customers ""they were out of meat and it would take at least 20 minutes to cook"" in a persuasive way to try and get everyone out. When I ordered a combo, she asked if I still wanted the egg rolls (that come with the combo) as that would delay my food even longer if I still wanted them. All the nozzles were off the soda machines so getting a drink was an even more difficult process. They also decided to lock up and turn off their open sign 25 minutes prior to close to keep other customers out. The only reason I give this location two stars is because the food is still better than eating at McDonald's. Terrible customer service. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Terrible experience! Do not go to this restaurant unless you have time and and money to waste! We were giving this place another chance after the first time when we were totally ignored at the door. We ordered wings which were very good. So we were feeling good about this second experience. ....ordered one of the specials...a chimichanga and I ordered something called chicken montrechet. After waiting for 45 minutes, our food finally came. Husband took one bite of chimichanga and literally had to spit it out. The tortilla was so over deep fried that it was dark brown and hard. The ground beef inside was black and inedible. My chicken was okay but had to scrape the sauce off asit had broken and looked congealed and tasted awful. We tried to get the waitresses attention so that we could send the chimichanga back but we could not get her attention for another twenty minutes. So my husband sat there with no food while I ate my dry chicken breast and baked potato. When she did show up, she apologized and my husband he just wanted their sky high sandwich to go ($8.00). We left and when we got home, my husband was starving and wanted to eat his $8 sky high sandwich! He opened it and took a bite only to discover that there was still the paper that comes between slices of cheese on the sandwich. Not only that but the sky high had two pieces of turkey and two pieces of swiss cheese (with paper) and a soggy smashed bun. It was disgusting and so my husband did not eat that night! Tried to call to speak to owner but neither owner turned up there that night. Other than one other table that night, there was no one else in the restaurant other than all the senior citizens at the bar to watch the Cardinals game. This place calls itself a bar and grill but I now know why it was almost empty on a game night. The food is awful, the service is sketchy and wait time is incredibly slow. We will not go back and will warn everyone not to patronize this place. A couple had walked in while we were waitingfor our food and after waiting for about 15 minutes, they walked out. They don't know how lucky they were. The owner of this place owns a place in Sun City called Royal Cafe, a breakfast and lunch place. Maybe they need to stick to that! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Since my wife and I moved to Las Vegas (this year), we have been looking for Chinese delivery as good as what we were used to getting in Los Angeles. Joyful House the best we have found yet. It is not delivery, but the takeout service was quick and attentive. Appetizers - the Crab Rangoon and Potstickers were good. The Crispy Fried Prawns were a bit thick on the breading, but the prawns themselves were flavorful. Main dishes - The Beef Tenderloin Mignon With Onion really was filet mignon, so far as I could tell. Very tender and flavorful, and they didn't skimp on the beef. The Sweet and Sour Pork was also flavorful, with only a hint of toughness; and the sauce did not drown out the flavor of the pork. The soft Pan Fried Noodles With Chicken was also well-prepared, with small but tender chunks of chicken breast. The prices were a little more than what we are used to, which is odd because coming from Los Angeles almost everything is much cheaper in Las Vegas. While we have not quite given up on trying some other places, we would be entirely satisfied to stick with Joyful House as our ""go to"" Chinese food in Las Vegas. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've been meaning to come back to this place for a while now after discovering it through a Yelp Elite event some time ago. I finally had the time, so I jetted down to the restaurant and I had a really good time. The service here was great. I was greeted and seated immediately, and decided that lunch was the way to go for me. I like the fact that they serve breakfast here until 2PM, because sometimes I DO want breakfast at noon! They also have happy hour daily from 3-7 which is awesome as well. No need to rush after work. Just do happy hour on a Saturday! Anyways, I went with the burger, and surprisingly, they have a variety of sides to choose from. I ""like"" french fries, but am always looking for something more at times. Sometimes I want a salad instead, or soup, and BLD gives you that choice. Instead of fries, they have 4 or 5 choices to go with. I went with hummus. It was delicious! Nice change of pace from fries.

 VIBE The decor at Le Cartet is awesome. Cool castor-esque light bulbs hang down from the ceilings. Cool cut outs of maps are on the wall and big pots of poinsettas are in the back. I can see it's a buzzy type of place for brunch/lunch. I came for lunch but where Le Cartet really misses out is on its service. I was not greeted. I was not asked normal things like: would you like something to drink? I had to ask for the specials. I ATE I had the salmon sandwich. It was a decent sandwich but I assumed I'd have slices of salmon as opposed to it being a creamy mishmash of a tuna melt. It was solid food but way overpriced with a measley green salad for $15. OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK Le meh. That said, I would come back if I'm directly in the area for ambiance or to buy something in the market. Otherwise, it's a bit on the edge of Old Montreal and out of the way for something that is ho-hum. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I took a friend that grew up in Miami there last weekend. She loved it, said it reminded her of home. She said the Cuban bread was just French bread and not the real thing. The beans and rice were delicious as were the maduros but they were a little too greasy for my liking. I soaked off the grease with my napkin. The atmosphere was lacking, it did feel like I was in someone's house and intruding at times. The TV was so loud it was ridiculous. Is this a restaurant or what? The server was horrible. She was eating while we were eating and never came up to ask us if we needed anything. I felt myself staring her down to try and get her attention to order a beverage and more napkins. It felt a little dirty in there too, I understand it's older and outdated but it can still use a good cleaning. The food was mediocre, I'd probably go again because there aren't many Cuban restaruants but I'll probably order to-go and I'll know what to expect, for the price, it's good. Oh by the way....you can't charge the tip...they only take cash! She was lucky I had cash on me or she wasn't going to get a tip, not that she deserved one anyway. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Today's lunch adventure: Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles at the Phoenix location. I had to let my food settle before I began writing. I am still in a food coma. I can compare this food coma to being Ryan Lochte for maybe 30 mins, because I feel slow and DUMB- Jeah! When driving to this place, you better look for it or you will miss it, but it is kind of hard to miss with people surrounding the door waiting to get in. We found a parking spot, walked in, gave our name and waited a total of 10 mins. We actually stood outside of the door for a minute or two before we went inside to see if your name was called. I have been wanting to come to this restaurant for along time now so I am glad I went with my friend Tamirra. She told me to pace myself because if not I will get sick. I seriously thought by the end of this lunch date I would be sweating grease and my pores would ooze of grease. I order the #9 lil amadi. I order it with 2 thighs and one waffle. It came out in 10 mins and all I can say is Oh my WORD! It was amazeballs. The chicken skin was crispy and juicy and the waffle could have been in the waffle iron for a tad longer but it wasn't mushy by any means. For the drink, I just ordered a water. There were two girls sitting next to me asking what the kool aid menu was, have you ever imagined asking a server what the koolaid menu was for the day? The server gave the colors and the respective flavors. She named them off: red, blue and purple and then went into the actual flavors tropical punch, blue raspberry and grape. Classy! :) Overall the meal was really good, the service was good as well. The server came probably a handful of times, to give us our drinks, take our order, give us boxes and the check. The only complaint that I have, which isn't even my problem but apparently they do not allow outside drinks inside of the restaurant. There was a gentleman drinking a starbucks coffee and a server actually stood there and waited for him to take a ""last sip"" before he had to hand it over.

I mean this isn't a high end steak place, rather it is a very casual Mediterranean restaurant serving normal cuts of meat. The portions are large but I still felt sticker shocked. The spice used is very good and the waiter did take time to explain some items to us, even trying to discourage our teenagers from trying the flavored milk type drink whose name eludes me now.

I could not find my Chase bank in Pittsburgh , so I decided to choose Citizens. I had some money in my previous bank Account and I want to transfer it to my citizen account. The person who works in citizens bank lied And cheated me. Since I am in USA for college and do not know most of rules , the employee told me you can transfer all your Money and your previous bank would not charge you and we also would not charge you. unfortunately , 2 days later my Chase bank charged me 3% present of that transaction , few days later , I closed my bank account at citizen . Now I am with PNC bank and I am very happy . Honest is important Shame on you citizen bank ",1,0,0,0,0

 If you're new to Charlotte and want to see what Southern food consists of, K & W is the sm \ u00f6rg \ u00e5sbord! Beyond the sterotypical fried chicken and collard greens, you'll get the idea of how our grandmas cooked. The heat lamps and excessive seasoning puts a slight damper on taste, but it's better choice than Golden Corral or Shoneys. *Shudder* If I'm jonesing for some comfort food and sweet Southern hospitality, this place is it. I'm a creature of habit, so I'll list some of my favs in no particular order: -Roast beef (sliced when ordered) with au jus -Mac n Cheese, homemade, baked, using slightly sharp cheese -Garlic Texas Toast -Chocolate Pie loaded with fresh-tasting whipped cream -Glazed carrots (is there any other way?) The line moves pretty fast, even at busy times. You can expect the after-church crowd on Sundays, but its otherwise steady flow of traffic. Hint: If you abhor the idea of cafeterias, this is NOT your restaurant. But if you can stand a dozen sweet grannies asking ""What can I get you, hon?"" (which is about as intolerant as Sunday afternoon naps in my opinion), you're gonna love it! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Great little spot. Bison sliders were a hit and it was definitely enough food to keep a hungry guy happy for at least a few hours. The waitress was cool as hell, and hot to boot. Had the suicide girls thing going on with tats and all. We were a party of 7 and our high roller decided to go with the $60 burger. He said it was good but wouldn't get it again. Another of our party lit up a cigarette and one of the bus boys came over and pretty rudely told her to put it out. I see where the guy was coming from but the attitude was unnecessary. Shakes with alcohol were very appealing. Someone at my table got one and said it was delicious so that's something on my list next time I head to vegas. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I found this place on yelp and I'm always up for trying new breweries but ended up being disappointed. For entrees I ordered the green chili Mac and cheese and added machata to it. Which is a shredded typed of beef. It was a bit spicy but good. My boyfriend ordered the carne asada tacos and these were extremely disappointing for $11. The two tacos were only a little bigger than mini tacos. It came with rice and beans that came in those sauce cups that you use to put your salsa in. That's it? For beer I ordered their Christmas ale. It tasted really good in the beginning but I'm a slow drinker. After a while it got really flat and tasted really bitter. I was disappointed that they had such a small selection of beers for a brewery. The only plus for me was our waiter was very friendly and knowledgable of their beers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 10 minutes after we checked into the room, we wanted to check out, as the room musty and poorly ventilated. And they were doing housecleaning down the hall, using chemicals to clean the rug.

 I went here last night to use my new living social deal. The decor is really great down to an awesome place setting, copper cup and copper silverware. I called ahead and made a resey for a Tuesday night and when we arrived there was a reserved sign on the front table. Really nice touch - we got the best table in the house. The food was really good. We ordered the vegdy appetizer platter, veggy meatball dish (skip this), garlic nan, and butter chicken. Everything was delicious and not at all spicy. I think the usual Indian buffets make things really spicy so you eat less, here I couldn't eat anymore b/c I was stuffed. I would be remiss if I didn't give a special kudo to the man who brought out our food and filled our drinks. Best Guy Ever. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This review is strictly on the Botox injections I received at Voci Spa. I know nothing else about their services like massages and facials so those may be great. My Botox experience has not been pleasant at all. I got in at the last minute with their most ""seasoned"" Botox injector. She spent plenty of time w me discussing her credentials and how she does things. I was very clear in my expectations about wanting my crows-feet taken care of. She suggested we do something like 10 units on each side including below the eyelid, right on top of my cheek where I have some fine lines as well. I told her I was hesitant bc I had heard it shouldn't be placed there due to lower eyelid swelling which can cause bags and even weaken your cheek a bit which could cause a slight sagging. I've been told this by other injectors. She assured me that would not be the case and encouraged me to do it. She said they charge by the unit which is what I was told when I initially called. This is not exactly precise. They charge by the Botox syringe or vial. Basically she said I would need 8-10 on each side so I had to purchase two syringes/vials meaning I'd have left over product. She said she'd ""find somewhere else to place the extra"" so I wouldn't waste it but I declined. I told her I wanted to go conservative this first time and maybe later I could come back for more vs using it just to use it. It was a turn off bc I was actually paying per area and not really per unit as I had been told. Anyway, she injected around my eyes including underneath. I bruised badly underneath my right eye (which has never happened before) and both lower lids immediately swelled which produced bags & extra lines. My concerns had been valid and I should've listened to my gut. I respect her many years in the business but that does not mean she is a good injector. A good injector takes into account the potential compensatory muscle movement and or swelling too in this case that can just give you a new problem whilst getting rid of another. The bruise goes away quickly but the bags don't and trust me Botox can cause bags underneath the eyes for sure- especially when too much product is used. Don't let anybody tell you differently. The bags may improve as the Botox where's off but while the fluid is there it's just stretching out that delicate skin and I can do nothing about it. The risk of placing it under the eye is just not warranted. Now I just wait for months to see if the bags improve. So frustrating. Listen to your gut people! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Holy cow, this place is extremely expensive!!! I spent over $14 on a small bag of candy. Yes, they do have a big selection of different candies but I don't think it's worth the price. I tried the watermelon sours, watermelon gummy bears and watermelon sour slices. Yes, I love watermelon but I don't love watermelon enough to spend $14 on a bag of sugary candy when I can buy a real watermelon for $5.

 Located smack bang in the middle of town, so handy for catch ups and a cuppa before having to run for the train or bus.

Again, this is a coffee place so it seems their tea is a bit less of a central thing. It was a standard tea bag in a pot. Just, you know, fine. Would come back due to location, as so central.

 I have lived in the area of Page's Dairy Mart for about 40 yrs. I have always enjoyed the ice cream until"" this"" day. I ordered an artic swirl (chocolate ice cream with chocolate chip cookie dough) I have ordered this same item over and over again. When I took first taste, no chocolate chip cookie dough pieces, second taste, same thing, third taste, same thing and so on for approximately 5 or 6 tastes. I took the cup with remaining up to counter and asked them to remake, I was denied told it would waste ""their"" money, nothing about mine, what I had ordered was more expensive than plain chocolate ice cream. They dumped what was in the medium cup into a small and handed back to me. Well it wasn't even a medium desert, since it fit into a small cup. I even tipped the girl $2 when I first received my desert. I will never return, to make any other purchases. I will however return to express my disdain to the owner when I can find him there.

 Have you ever hyped up a place so large that it couldn't do anything else but be a let down? Many of these reviews would receive ""don't trust"" or some sort of ""block"" tag if Yelp offered one. Have you ever heard the saying that you could fry a ______, and it would taste good? BBQ isn't much different. As long as your sauce isn't horrible and you don't turn your Q into jerky, it's probably decent. Don't get me wrong, I'm not about to tell you that Mac's has bad Q, but it's...just...Q. It's smokey...it's tender...and the sauce is decent. If you came here because you like Q, it means you've obviously had Q that was done properly to like it...right? The ribs are definately the star IMO, the pulled pork and brisket make me say, ""yep, that's barbecue"" They know how to make their Q and it tastes decent, but I'm not walking out of here doing the OMG dance. The sides are decent as well, nothing eye popping or mind blowing, but decent. The beer selection and atmosphere are what kicks Mac's up a notch for me. I love to pick beers to go along with what I'm eating...and Mac's has that category nailed down. The atmosphere is boisterous, friendly and thriving, while managing to keep a relaxed atmosphere throughout the dark and smoky establishment. Mac's is definately worth the trip. Come hungry and leave full. Try: The St. Louis ribs...just what the doctor ordered Avoid: The domestic beers (C'mon, you can do better than that) ",0,0,0,1,0

 ""Meh. I've experienced better,"" fully captures how I felt about CAC. I found them here on Yelp, visited their website, and sent an email requesting membership info. I'm new to town and used to a certain quality of gym and have some requirements: Precor ellipticals, zumba and body pump classes that actually fit my schedule, and a convenient location. I don't even mind a hefty price tag because fitness is a priority for me. But I was distinctly underwhelmed by this gym. Sure, you walk in and it seems ultra swanky and exclusive- even the guy at the front desk is wearing a jacket, for crying out loud. But as I took myself on a tour of the facilities, I couldn't help but notice a few things that turned me off: the women's locker room has a ton of lockers, several bathroom stalls, and a bunch of showers.. but a tiny area to change in, with only one bench. It appears there's a push for members to pay the extra $50 for access to the private locker room. Okay, duly noted. The downstairs cardio area has the machines I like, but I was a little bummed that the models present did not have the individual screens. Rather, there were two screens for the entire cardio area, and set at a bit of a distance away. No big, I can bring in my iPad and watch Netflix while I churn out my miles right? Nope, no wifi. For $50/month, you'd think that would be a given. Upstairs wasn't much better- tons of equipment, and only a few people present, most of whom were working one on one with trainers or just sitting around. In fact, that's what bugged me most: maybe I was just there during an off-peak time, but everyone present seemed more focused on being in such a swanky environment. I don't think I saw anyone there genuinely working up a sweat. Ultimately I didn't feel very comfortable here but still wanted to give the place a try. Met up again with Juan, my tour guide who stayed at the front desk, and received what passed for the ""sales pitch""- a laminated card of their pricing, and a vague, ""So, wanna sign up?"" I had mixed feelings about that- I really didn't feel sold to or pressured, which was a plus. But I also didn't feel like any attempt at all was made to MAKE me want to join this gym. I genuinely wanted to give them a try, but the fact that I wasn't even able to get a pass for a day or two to try it out and see if I liked it was discouraging. To end on a positive note though, for the month of January their promotion is that the initiation fee is half off: to join it's usually $120 + your monthly fee based on your membership ($50 on up to like $150 to get access to kickboxing/CrossFit); but in January it's just $60.

 I was here a few days ago to buy a book I could not remember the title of. The customer service desk was empty for a long, long time, and when someone finally did come, he didn't look at me and just said ""What do you need?"" instead of any friendly exchange. While I tried to remember the name of the book, he was literally tapping his foot. He couldn't find it and seemed supremely irritated with me that I had the gall to come to a bookstore and ask for help finding a book. When I left and said, ""Don't worry about it,"" he didn't acknowledge me and continued doing what he was doing before.

 Don't really eat Mexican food out much. Usually prefer the homemade stuff. In Vegas though I don't get much of that either so I decided to venture and try this place based on the great reviews. We tried the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, mini-molletes, and a quesadilla arabe. I got the chipotle sauce from the quesadilla on the side, just in case. It wasn't too spicy but had delicious smoky flavor. If you're a bit shy with spicy food, ask them to try the sauce before you order, they're happy to comply.

 What a quaint little bistro this is! We made reservations to dine with some friends for dinner. There was a nice ambiance in the dining area with a guitarist and singer that played light music during our visit. The restaurant was very welcoming and cozy. We started off with the Dungeness Crab Cake. They were good! Not over the top but still good. This was served with mixed greens, At the same time a bread basket was brought out for the table. It was just ok. It was kind of mushed and dry. For my entree I chose the Pan seared white fish in which the waiter was raving about. I can see why... Delicious and tasty! The garlic white wine sauce smothered the fish. The pesto mashed potatoes that accompanied were ok. I wish there was more of a pesto flavor. The service here is impeccable. Our waiter was very attentive. The other staff which helped with refills were very polite and accommodating. Our entire group enjoyed the food and service. I would recommend trying them out!

 I visit Las Vegas on business for a nonprofit and have stayed here 3 times to keep our costs down. I paid $26 earlier this week. However, had I checked I could have paid $30 at Stratosphere a few blocks away for better room and ambiance. Similar rates were available in nearby downtown (Fremont Hotel, etc). As a result I think I will pay a few dollars more for a better experience next time. Room was small. It was pretty clean although some dirt in bath was missed. Toilet ran intermittently all night. Linens and towels are clean but very worn. No hair dryer or clock in the room, altho they will loan you these if they have them. TV worked OK. Neighborhood is the biggest drawback. There are some empty stores and defunct wedding chapels, plus occasional homeless people and addicts on the sidewalk. These folks are trying, and for some of the lowest rates in Nevada you can't expect too much. I just think the experience is marginal enough that I will look for something more reliable next time.

 This TJ Maxx was recently renovated about 2 years ago, so everything is actually very well organized and clean for a discounted department store. The dressing rooms are brand new! When it comes to buying clothes, I prefer Marshall's over TJ Maxx. However, they do have a good selection of home goods here. They also have a pretty good jewelry section here which is NOT available at Marshalls, so this is a plus. When I say jewelry I mean sterling silver and chain necklaces and charms and pendants, not just fashion jewelry. They also have a good selection of purses here and beauty and hair products. Overall no complaint about this store! I have been frequenting this store for the past 5 years.

 The hamachi (yellowtail) we had here was a very generous portion and absolutely perfect. The sushi chef and kitchen staff know what they are doing here. The ambiance/interior design is kind of dated and it's a little weird to have a spot in a bank, but we liked the food (lunch) a lot. The only sort of unpleasant thing was that one of the staff (bartender?) was hanging around before her shift (I'm guessing) and was very unprofessionally spreading her crap out on the bar as she ate her meal, and then was going back and forth behind the counter, while she complained loudly about something personal. It was intrusive. I worked in restaurants throughout my 20s, so I'm not being prissy about this. It's just bad form. Other than that, it was a pretty good experience and I would eat here again.

 I'll be quick about this restaurant. When you dine there, you have the choice of dining at the casual, less expensive section in the front or the formal back area, which was much more expensive. Money wasn't a factor for me and my friends, so we went to the formal dining area, which we were told is that they're known for. I had the 6 course Chef's Extravaganza menu, which had (1) a starter that consisted of three types of seafood in some type of broth: scallop, tuna, and salmon; (2) lobster on top of tube like pasta (I can't remember the Italian name), but I found the lobster to be yummy and the pasta to be too salty for my taste; (3) the main course was seared ostrich in some yummy sauce. I wasn't a fan of ostrich, but my friend who helped me finished half of my ostrich loved the dish. Personally, I thought it was not as healthy of a meal as I would like. (4) I also had artisan cheese and fruit, which was good. Again, being on a diet, I only had a few tiny morsels of the cheese. (5) The dessert was amazing, which was a bavarian dish with carmel ice cream, white chocolate sticks, and some other very sweet goodness. There was a 6th dish, but I don't remember what it was. I also ordered half a dozen Kumamoto oysters, which tasted very fresh and wonderful. That and the dessert were probably my favorite dishes that night. Oh before, I forget, I tasted my friend's USDA filet mignon. That's a nice slab of meat that tasted better than my ostrich. For the price, I wish I had been wowed by every one of my dishes. I'd probably give it a 3.5 to 4 stars. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Made the mistake of not reading the accurate reviews of the shady business practices. I have rented cars literally over a hundred times and this is by far the most fraudulent shady business location I have ever encountered in the world. The first hint that something is shady is that they spent an exorbitant amount of time trying to get you to buy their insurance and come up with all these crazy reasons you need it which other car companies will gladly assist you with. They say you have to pay for an old battery that goes dead, you have to pay for a a damaged tire, etc regardless if it was your fault or not. I have never heard of such nickel and diming. They also heavily emphasize that you have to pay for any repair time. The real problem is when you return the car the person inspecting the car is guaranteed to find something wrong with the car, even tiny things like a tiny chip in the window or paint chipped off or small dents, etc. They will find something and they will make you pay dearly. I am sure they get a bonus for writing down any possible damage on the car. I am sure after they collect the additional money from you they spend absolutely none of it to fix the car so they can blame the next person for the damages and so on and so on so everybody pays for the damages from the customer from 50 rentals previous. This is how they make their money. Whatever enjoyment you got from your trip to Vegas will be completely obliterated when you have to deal with Budget when you return the car. This is beyond a classless business. You have been warned. Read all of the reviews both recommended and not recommended. The Reviews not recommended will support all of the recommended reviews. Avis, Alamo in my opinion are the best, never once was I nickel and dimed and fraudulently schemed like at Budget. Enterprise and Hertz are ok but their cars aren't the greatest and sometimes they are damaged but they will not try to make sure you are to blame from a previous renter's damage like this Budget place will do. Although other Budget places may not have such shady practices, Las Vegas Budget is by far the seediest. I don't know if this is their business model as the best and easiest way to make money off of their customers, but I will never rent from them again. Shame on me for getting scammed this time. I would be a total foolish moronic idiot to ever rent from here again. Negative stars would be a more accurate portrayal. This place just makes my blood boil. Disclaimer: I am actually being nice in this review. I would rather say a whole bunch of expletives on how awful this experience was. Whoever defends this place obviously works for them or is related to somebody who is a manager here. I wouldn't be surprised if all of the positive reviews come from employees and managers here. I do not see how anybody could have a pleasant experience here. They probably will treat you a little better if you bought all of their expensive extra insurance and were paying full price with no discount. You are warned. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The first time we visited a Crazy Mocha, they put ice cream in the coffee. Now THAT'S crazy! But they don't do that anymore. How dare they call themselves crazy?! They have absolutely NOTHING crazy to offer. Now that they got rid of this unique add-on (""it was such a hassle"" the barista explained), it's really just a run-of-the-mill boring coffee shop. I do like the convenience of the computers available inside...we frequently use these to check the movie times before heading to the theater. The roll-up doors are also a cool feature. But coffee-wise, it's basically a big ""eh"" from me. The service is okay at best...a recent Craigslist job posting from them reveals that they only pay their baristas minimum wage, so they do the minimum amount of work in return. At one location the barista kept going outside to smoke and chat with her buddy in between serving customers. I don't know...I love to support local businesses, but it helps if they have something unique or memorable to offer in return. ",0,1,0,0,0

Well, if they booked amazing bands and I didn't know a bartender at Wasted Space (the chain store version of the Double Down) at Hard Rock who liquored me for free... ",0,0,0,1,0

 The food was OK, but not for the amount we paid. Their drinks are spectacular, however the entire menu is very overpriced. I had a mixed cauliflower and veggie plate which cost $ 13.00. (Winter Ingredient Salad) $ 13 dollars for veggies? Come on. I was starviing when I left. If you want a pricy meal over at The Quarter, skip this place and visit Tanzy up by the i pic theater. More bang for your buck. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Small, dark, themeless, nice drinks, lots of pretentious attitude, comfy booths, everyone stares and sizes up whomever walks in the front door and engages their coolness meter, fun patio, pool table, decent jukebox. Fun! Or... Bunch of tryhard scenesters covered in tattoos and piercings, trying to out-weird each other while swilling their PBR or whatever. OK, do I need to pick one? It's a fun place to go for a drink. This is not a Scottsdale bar. The crowd is mid 20's through mid 40's. Expect to see some goths, hipsters, rockabilly types, 80's industrial leftovers, lesbians on dates, perhaps a knife fight, people on their way home from work who stopped in to get plowed, and who knows what. I only started going here recently, but each time I've gone I've run into people whom I know from other places, which is kind of neat. I am getting the feeling that it's the kind of place I can show up and not necessarily have to bring my own company, but maybe that's just me. Other yelpers seem to think it's unfriendly. Whatevs! Maybe it's you. I brought two different first dates here recently. Later, neither turned out to be a great match for me, and neither of them really liked Shady's. There might be a correlation. I love using the word ""correlation"" in a dive bar review. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Wtf!? Who puts disgusting, processed American cheese on a sub sandwich!? Every time I go back to this place, it gets worse. For...the...love...of...God... This is why I'm scared to go out for lunch in Phoenix. Nobody seems to have a clue about what you should and shouldn't do. Also, the bread. Why choose a bread that has millions of tiny sesame seeds? Hmm? No bueno. Hey, Hero Factory, the 80s called. They love your cheese. The rest of us, not so much. I paid about $11.00 for this awesome sub and a small bag of chips. If you appreciate it when people flaunt their right to wear a gun in public, then this is the place for you. However, if you want some decent food, I would avoid the Hero Factory. They get 2-stars for quick service and good jalapeno potato chips. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was not impressed with this convention center at all. I was there for a 10,000 or so person convention. There is no where near enough food to feed the people that fit in this building. The lines for the over priced bland food were so long! I do not want to spend my convention time standing in line for food. The layout to get to the different rooms is weird. There are two seperate areas for the convention which includes lots of walking to get from one to another. Its nice that it connects to the hotel, but its way at the end of the strip for people staying in other hotels. Would not recommend. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We checked out Industry yesterday for the first time for lunch. For a Sat lunch they were packed, possibly due to the Pens game that was on. We did not order any drinks, so while they do seem to have an impressively large drink menu (especially beers and whiskeys) I can not comment on that, but only the food. The special of the day was one pound of wings for half price, so my husband, got a pound of wings with the dry rub. My husband normally prefers buffalo wings (which they do have) but did say they have a good dry rub. I got the Lucy sandwich, a roasted veggie sandwich with cheese and a vinaigrette on it. The sandwich was good, but messy as the vinaigrette sauce was runny and just seemed to get everywhere. Instead of the fries that come with the sandwich, I got a side of mac and cheese instead. The mac and cheese was great. Very cheesy. Almost wished I had gotten an entree size serving of mac and cheese. We also got the loaded fries to split. The loaded fries come with bacon and cheddar cheese on them. I would have liked more cheese on them, but the fries were good. The service was lacking. Granted, I know they were busy, but my husband had to wait 5-10 minutes for his soda, and we had to even remind our server about it. When we finally paid the check we again had to wait 5-10 min for the waiter to even come back around to pick it up so we could leave. Overall I think the place has a nice concept, just needs better service. ",0,0,1,0,0

 So here's the deal on JITB. In the 5 years we have lived in Buckeye we have only gone through the drive thru at this location. We have only gotten the oreo shakes. (Little tip if you bring them home and put them in the freezer for a couple of hours they are simply awesome you eat them with a spoon) So yesterday my wife and I decided to stop in here and get some of the food. The service was very friendly as it always has been. The dinning room was cleanish, but for whatever reason the men's bathroom was closed. The food honestly was not good. A couple of cheeseburgers, an order of curly fries, a couple of tacos that I have heard people rave about, and a drink. The meat on the burgers is obviously a frozen patty that was overcooked and dry. The fries were ok, but the tacos were not that good, and I cannot figure out why people would rave about them. Really aside from the occasional oreo shake I will not be returning to this place for anything else. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This store is ok but it's customer service is comparable to Walmart! Crappy! I wanted to gets this Doc Mc Stuffins play doctors coat. This one happened to be marked down two dollars less making it $10 because It was missing a badge. It was also dirty and the stethoscope was broken so I asked if it could be marked down a little more. The cashier called the manager over to ask her if this could be done and instead of coming over and speaking to me she just shook her head ""no"" and walked away.

 About 15 years ago, the owner would sell pocket sandwiches to people sitting in traffic along 2nd ave. I tried one of these and it was excellent: a good combination of fresh baked bread, meat, spices, etc. I've stopped by a few times since, but you never really know what will be served, or if the place is even open. This is truly a one man operation, and definitely an experience in dining. So yes, make your reservation, bring a bottle of Hungarian Bull's Blood wine, and enjoy authentic Hungarian cooking and a social experience. ",0,0,0,1,0

 If you're in the mood for a great italian meal and maybe a glass of wine or two, you cannot go wrong with Oregano's. Be prepared to wait for a table (it's a great restaurant!) but once you're inside, you'll be pleasantly surprised. I've been to this location several times. Small and with limited parking (in the back), it can be a little crowded. But the atmosphere is wonderful! Fairly quiet but with a great energy, the vibe here is unlike any other. The food is absolutely on point. I most recently ordered a pizza and we were not able to finish it between two people. If you're in downtown Scottsdale and need to grab a bite to eat, don't pass up Oregano's. A bit on the upscale side, it's well worth a visit! ",0,0,0,1,0

 My friends and I used to visit District fairly often for happy hour but ever since they changed their bar menu, we all agreed we won't be coming back any time soon. Last time we went, we all ordered the mac and cheese, the pretzel bites, and Kobe beef sliders. The mac and cheese and pretzel were items we had enjoyed munching on in the past while having some beers, so we were sorely disappointed with what eventually came out. The mac and cheese had a familiar taste and it didn't take long for us to figure it out: Hamburger helper with cheese puffs. Listen, I'm not hating on hamburger helper but it's not exactly what I want when I go to an ""upscale"" bar for happy hour. The pretzel bites which were once warm, soft, and chewy chunks of pretzels were replaced by thinly sliced, toasted pieces of pretzel. Think brushcetta only with pretzels. Neither soft nor crunchy, it just lacked any textural identity, which made it all the more disappointing. Oh and the sliders...they looked like two average sliders for $10. Honestly it felt like the chef decided to get a little cutesy with the menu. I'm not against presentation but when it's paired with mediocre food and shrinking portions, it looks all the more ridiculous. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place gave my friend and I (after asking if it was our first time eating there) EIGHT samples to try!! They explained the food is named after children-which I didn't really understand, but who cares it was SUPER SUPER TASTY! I really like their asada, and I think its called chicken jade or something like that..but you can have ANY of the items made into a burrito, a rice bowl, or a quesadilla. It's pretty amazing. I ordered #5 garlic chicken with onions and tomatoes the tomatoes were not really stewed more like they were baked with the chicken, nothing really overpowered anything it was a great balance between all the flavors, and on top of plain rice it was perfect! Atmosphere is fastfood dining, and they have outdoor seating for smokers like me. My friend ordered the Carnitas on top of their version of fried rice, which has meat in it -giving the rice a delicious flavor - just engulfed the plate in a matter of minutes, it was THAT good! Highly recommend this place, the items on the menu are extremely well thought out, the prices are amazing for the food you get -5.00 for a large plate!! AND you get your choice of cookie for desert..the chocolate one melts in your mouth, its gooey on the inside in some parts of it and sprinkled with powdered sugar. They brought our order TO us outside, which they didnt have to..As far as customer service goes, they are on it. I would say it's on a gourmet level in a fast food wrapper. GO! *right now there is construction that obstructs the front of the place, but doesn't affect parking, which there is plenty of* ",0,0,0,0,1

 I had a feeling before stepping foot (how about that for a quick pun!) into this store that the prices were going to drive me away. I was also expecting a lot more footwear options. I was correct on the price, wrong on the selection. The wall of shoes is very lacking. I have a big and wide foot with a fairly shitty flat arch so I constantly have trouble finding a shoe that: A) fits, and B) looks decent. This store had a handful of shoes that were in the 4E width I need, but not many in a style/color scheme that didn't look like it was designed by a hardcore raver in the peak of his acid trip. The man running the store was very friendly at first, but quickly pissed me off because without even looking at my foot he said the foot size I told him I had wasn't true. Guy, I've had my foot for a long time, I'm pretty sure I know my size. But whatever...he measures it and surprise surprise, my foot is the size I said it is. So he starts showing me the few models in stock that will fit, none of which really float my boat. He then proceeds to tell me I need to wear a size smaller so my toes smash and strain against the toe of the shoe. Yea, no. I'm going to be doing a lot of running and working out in these shoes and I don't need any sort of discomfort. I'd rather buy slightly bigger than slightly smaller. I was never explained the reasoning, but he tried polishing it as a Mr. Wizard statement, thou I took it as an answer from Dr. Stupid (I really miss Ren & Stimpy). I try on the shoes...and look, I haven't worked many retail jobs in my life, but I know better than to talk about religion or politics with a potential customer. This guy didn't get that memo. While I'm walking around he starts talking about Obama and Gingrich and that other guy with the million dollar haircut. Another thing I hate is forced sales practices. The shoes felt good in the width and arch, not in the length since he's cramming my foot into this too small shoe. I ask him about a larger size but he says no. OK. Then he proceeds to say ""So do you want to wear them out? And will it be cash or charge?"" Slow your role guy, who said shit about me buying these...you won't even bring out the size I requested or need. Just out of curiosity I ask how much there are. Without batting an eye he quotes $139. $139?!?! It's a mid-tier New Balance running shoe, what are you high, I'm not paying that! I pull out my phone and look them up online and I find the same model shoe, in a better color actually, on Amazon and Zappos for $76. That's almost half the price. So I pry the shoes off and hand them back to him and tell him thanks for his time. He still forces the sale, I tell him no thanks, he gets pissy and says fine, the shoes you have will destroy your feet. You'd think for as much as he overprices these shoes he'd be able to afford the non-sour grapes. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Sunshine Baskets & Gifts is a wonderful surprise for a any person looking for some help with gift wrapping during the holiday season. One would think there would countless wrapping services available in Las Vegas during the holiday season. Well, there's not. Unless you buy your gifts at a specific location that offers wrapping during the holidays OR you want a Girl Scout's weary mother handling your precious gifts, you will be wrapping the gifts yourself. And outside of the Christmas holiday there are only two business that I know of who offer a wrapping service: Alligator Soup and Papyrus. They were the only businesses offering this service during the ""off season"" in the whole town. So you can imagine my joy at discovering Sunshine Baskets & Gifts---they not only did a lovely job with my gift wrapping, but the owner and her husband were kind and provided excellent service. I know purists want the joy of wrapping each and every gift themselves. I have no such desires. Days before Christmas I needed MANY gifts wrapped and I had little to no time to do it. I contacted Sunshine Baskets & Gifts and the owner, Kathleen, arranged her schedule so that I could bring over 20+ packages to be wrapped. I took some paper, my credit card, and my pre-labeled gifts. Kathleen promised to use some of her own paper if mine ran out. What really impressed me about Sunshine Baskets & Gifts was their willingness to go above and beyond to make my life a little easier. I told her I was planning to ship a few of the packages and she offered to box and ship them for me. It took some trust to leave a number of gifts with a stranger (not associated with the Post Office, UPS, Fedex, or any other such entity). But I took the risk. And I'm glad I did. The gifts arrived on time and according to my family, they were all beautifully wrapped. And I was very pleased with the rest of the gifts that I picked up the next day. In all, I spent about $100 for the entire service. With paper, decorations, labor, shipping, and boxing during the craziness of the Christmas season, I felt like I was very fairly charged. This is not a huge operation. This is two considerate people who care about providing good service. I was happy with the workmanship and I intend to use their services in the future. ",0,0,0,1,0

 WELCOME BACK BONEFISH! We missed you but you don't get 5 stars until you bring Grouper back. Tito's Texas Martini may be the best in town and such a deal as well. We really enjoyed the Paco & Lola Albarino but it's $10 less a bottle at King's Fishhouse. We loved the Bang Bang shrimp and Seared Ahi appetizers. However, the dinners were the real stars: Dorado with mango salsa on the side was incredibly fresh with a nice taste of the grill. Ditto for the Redfish special with Romesco sauce, on the side of course. Overall the food quality may be better than my memories of the old store in Henderson. A couple of suggestions: I don't think open bus/service areas will ever be as popular as open kitchens were, so build a wall and add a door. It's ugly and distracting to have that area open to the lovely dining room. About those window shades, they're going the wrongway! Something is needed to block the lower part of the windows, to obscure the view of the parking lot and keep headlights from shining into the dining room. A few minor issues that should be addressed but great food and drinks at reasonable prices. Hope they stick around for a long time. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My friend and I made appointments together for mani-pedis for first thing when the salon opened at 9 a.m. on a Thursday. The salon is spacious and clean, and has two pedicure areas...one that is a row, and one that is circular. When putting us ""next"" to each other in the circular area, we were at 30 degree angles to each other's backs. A bit difficult to carry on a conversation. No one asked us how we wanted our appointments handled, just rushed at us both with one person on the feet and one person on the hands all at once. We were looking forward to a relaxing pedicure, then a leisurely manicure before a nice lunch. One out of three happened. We had a nice lunch. Both of us have regular salons we go to, but this was half way between our residences, and that is why we chose it. You would have thought there was going to be a stampede of customers the way they rushed us through our grooming. Once finished, we each paid by credit card. No tips are allowed to be added to charges, but they will happily direct you to the ATM they have right inside the salon. I gave the man who did my pedicure a $20.00 bill and told him that was for both my friend and myself for our gratuities. He said, ""all FOUR?"" I told him...yeeees, for the two of us, for all four people who helped us. Again, he repeated, ""All FOUR?"" And it became quite clear he was not happy with that amount of a tip. Two manicures, two pedicures, approximately $120.00, and we were given the bum's rush. I thought it was quite generous all things considered. There was no thank you, no hope to see you again. Five days later, my friend told me that her cuts were healing. The man cut her in four places on her heel. And her French manicures on her toes and fingers were already cracking and chipping. Nice. Not to worry. We shall not darken your door again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was looking for something Japanese around me but had no luck until I came across this place, the prices are fair. I don't understand why people are complaining about the price, it's coming from japan! Of course it will be more than the American junk candy.

They are willing to help you out and they give you a nice verity of food and items for a little shop they are.

 I went here with the family for some ""amazing"" nachos as advertised. The ambiance is that of a bar, with additional tables for families. TVs everywhere and the place is LOUD. We ordered the cheeseburger nachos and the BBQ pulled pork nachos. Our waitress was nice and attentive, and we did not have to wait for drinks or refills. When the food came out I was a little surprised. A large pile of nachos covered in about everything you can think of. The cheeseburger nachos were really quite good, even my picky 7 year old liked them. The plating is something to be desired, on an oval skillet-type platter that is too small for the amount of food, and many a nacho ended up in the laps of my kids. The BBQ pulled pork nachos were not that great, but only because it was WAY too much. You need a gallon of water to swallow five bites, and the BBQ sauce and cheese are overwhelming to the palate. Overall, not bad, but not spectacular. I would go again if I absolutely had to. ",0,0,1,0,0

 So, it seems Fleur changed their menu quite a bit. Some items I liked are no longer on the menu: In the Shower Mac n Cheese, Croque Monsieur and Almond Panna Cotta. That's ok though, they have similar items. Hubert Keller always serves perfection on a plate! Roasted Bone Marrow: Onion jam, marrow butter, bacon and pain rustic. You just can't go wrong with bone marrow...add bacon to that. Oh c'mon! Worth clogging your arteries for. 5/5 Fried Truffle Mac n Cheese: Truffle bechamel, ham and peas. There's only a few places in town that has good fried mac n cheese - Fleur is one of them. 5/5 Fleur Burger: Wagyu beef, brioche comes with pomme frites. Add Foie Gras and Black Truffles. It's the same as Hubert Keller's (other restaurant) Burger Bar's Rossini burger. Best burger you'll ever eat! Glad they didn't take this off the menu. 5/5 Pot de Creme: Mocha or chocolate.

 Park Place really falls under the heading of ""your home restaurant"" the same way as you have a home church or bar. If you're driving by 51 and 485, stuck at CMC Pineville, or just need a good place to eat, this is the place. If there is anything unusual about the menu, it's the depth. No matter your tastes, you'll find something you like; and it'll be good. I have yet to be disappointed there. Eggs in the morning, a sandwich for lunch, and a filling dinner. On those days when I'm out and hungry, there's no better place to go. When I tire of burgers and chicken fried steak, there's the Greek salad or giro. I like their chicken livers -- they're always good. Breakfast is breakfast. I order the way I want it, they cook it like I tell them and I eat it. That's worth a star all by itself.

 First the good: Great service and a cool room. I like how the restaurant is on a different level from the casino floor. Now the bad, the food is terrible. I had the Sea bass, it was over cooked and too salty, and send it back. My wife had the NY strip, I ordered one to replace my fish. They were not cooked evenly, and were a little dry. I know steak houses use a laser to check temperature. If your job is working the grill in a steakhouse, you should be able to cook a perfect steak be sight and touch. Come on, in a restaurant in Aria charging $50/ entree, I shouldn't be complaining about the preparation of our meal. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I visited during the soft opening and opted for pre-theatre, which at only \ u00a316.50 for two courses or \ u00a319.50 for 3 - including steak - is a good deal. The chips were particularly good, and I enjoyed the steak too (sirloin with pre-theatre, although your server does show you a platter of all the cuts before you order which is a nice touch). Service was good, a little ropey but the restaurant had only opened the day before and they were very friendly, rectifying the mistake with our bill straight away. The decor's trendy and smart too.

 I stopped by here on the way to a club crawl and I have for to say I loved the quality of pizza they put out. In particular this mushroom based Forager pizza was amazing. The only draw back was the line was a little long and moved a little slow but the young lady at the counter made up for the wait with good customer service. Overall it's worth it just for the flavor profile of the wood fired pizza alone. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Well, there were some good points and some not so good. I gave it a 2 because the whole description is what it felt like-Meh. I had heard some good things about Match. Reviews from actual food critics. (whom I am not sure I trust so much right now). So I might have had kinda high expectations going in. It was a Tues. night, 9pm and we were the only diners. Not the best sign. We started with cocktails. I ordered a Suspicious Minds-a ginger version of the cosmopolitan and it was drinkable although a bit dry. My husband ordered the Aloha (something) which was made with pineapple flavored vodka. Think artificial pineapple candy flavored with rubbing alcohol. Not very good. He could barely finish it and went for the Kiwi Caipiroska..due to actual muddled fruit, it was sour but better than his previous drink. I wouldn't even suggest a cocktail menu any more if you aren't going to use real fruit, real juice, and infused rather than flavored alcohols. I like that each food item has the country of origin printed next to it. Kind of makes you feel like you are eating around the world. They are open until 2am and that is a great idea for our side of town too. I guess when you are drunk the blandness of the food would be a good thing. The prices are very reasonable (not like SOME places in town) so we felt comfortable to get quite a variety of small plates. We started with the Sashimi Salad, Salt and Pepper Calamari, Belgium Frites, Dragon Balls, Tuna Poke and usually we would order more. Well, here's why we didn't. The Sashimi Salad had a decent amount of little pieces of sashimi and for the price I think it was justifiable. There was way too much vinegar-ey dressing on way too little greens. And the greens weren't really green but that horrible industrial iceberg lettuce mix a Walmart shopper adores. Greens are so inexpensive they could at least have given us a large portion to absorb all that vinegar. The Salt & Pepper Calamari was missing the salt and pepper. We actually really tried to find the pepper..maybe it was white pepper? But couldn't see any or taste it either. I have had this dish many times and usually you can actually taste the Salt and Pepper. The panko style breading was a good crispyness, the calamari a bit too chewy (it kept snapping back at me!) but it had about NO flavor. The Belgium Frites could have been Ore Ida. I had these in San Francisco and I wouldn't be surprised if these were frozen from the bag and barely fried. No salt to distract me here either. The sauce Andolouse (?) was supposed to be spicy and was about as flavorful as your basic mayo. Then the Dragon Balls. We have had these types of creations at some sushi bars so we KNOW that you CAN deep fry sushi and still have it be moist inside. These were not. They were fried so much on the outside they should be called Dragon Cannon Balls..and the spicy tuna inside was cooked so much that it didn't have any more flavor. Last but not least we tried the Tuna Poke..I guess it can be considered authentic because there was Tuna and sesame oil..but since tuna is so light in flavor, that much sesame oil can be over powering. I love sesame oil but really, a dish of it isn't that appealing. Being the food adventurers we are we were going to try dessert anyway. And here comes the best part of the meal. We ordered the Hawaiian dessert which was like a biscuit dough deep fried and rolled in sugar. The doughy balls had a lovely browned crispy outside with a tender light biscuit consistency inside. Served warm, the sugar covering the dough was moist and perfect. We also ordered the Frozen Coconut. This is a great coconut sorbet, not too sweet with a creamy (not like ice cream) texture. Served inside a halved coconut shell it was the perfect ending to a less than perfect meal. ",0,1,0,0,0

 AMT Coffee should kick-ass. An English business run by three brothers, they started off with one shop in Oxford and have slowly expanded across the UK with a string of distinctive bronze kiosks. They were the first company to sell Fairtrade coffee and all their drinks are made with organic milk . At \ u00a31.45, \ u00a31.95 and \ u00a32.00 for espressos, cappuccinos and lattes, their prices are also significantly cheaper than you know who. The problem is, the coffee.

 Wow. Probably one of the worst experiences I have ever had with local retail. For those of you just looking for a quick review, the owner was condescending and deliberately tried to mislead me. I brought in 3 pipes to be reamed and sterilized. and when I got them back the insides were still flithy. When I confronted him, he tried to convince me that you can't clean the insides. It ended with me telling him he lost a customer. For the full story read below. I'm new to pipe smoking and have been frequenting several of Phoenix's local tobacco shops looking for a new pipe and place I can call my own. When I first went to Ye olde pipe things were pleasant enough, it was just before closing and a young cigar smoking kid approached my wife and I with a big smile and offered to let us see any of the pipes we wanted. I was ready to impulse buy and he suggested I take my time and come in later and talk to a regular customer of theirs who knew everything there was to know about pipes. I was pretty excited about how cool the store seemed and that they were really invested in developing regular customers. I found a few estate pipes at an antique store and went back to ye olde pipe to buy some cleaning supplies. The kid was there with another man and they suggested I just have the shop clean them for me and that it would be about $5 a pipe. I came in the next day and the owner was at the counter. I showed him my pipes and he said it would be $10 a pipe. More than what I was quoted, but 10 bucks seemed reasonable. I asked what the cleaning entailed and he said they reamed the bowl, cleaned and sterilized the shank and polished the outside. I gave him my pipes and came back a few days later. The shanks looked a lot better and the bowls seemed a bit cleaner, but when I separated the shank from the bowl, the insides were still full of gunk. I showed it to him and he grumbled something about it just being cleaning supply residue and he put a pipe cleaner through it and said it was fine. I double checked to make sure the whole thing was sterilized as I had no idea where the pipe was before. He said yes, I bought some tobacco and a pouch and dropped him 50 bucks when I checked out. When I got home and examined the pipes under light I realized the shanks were just as filthy as when I brought them in. When I ran a pipe cleaner with a bit of alcohol on it though the pipe it came out brown with a single pass. I took the pipes back and asked him if they passed as clean to him? He shrugged me aside and said yes, they looked fine, what was my problem? Since he refused to acknowledge the visible gunk in the shaft I gave him a pipe cleaner with alcohol to pass through it. When it came out brown he began to defend himself by saying you can never get everything out. As he put more cleaners through it and they came out browner and browner he began to concede a little that maybe it could use another pass, but that I only paid $10 bucks a pipe so what did I expect? A full restoration would cost $40-50. All of this was explained to me with a condescending air as if I was too young and stupid to know anything about a clean pipe.I told him I expected a clean and sterile pipe and that he never mentioned that I would need to spend $40.00 to have it actually cleaned. I then asked if he really believed the pipes were clean to his standards, he said yes. I then told him that he could give me my pipe back (which he was still pulling brown pipe cleaners out of) and that I didn't appreciate his condescending attitude. I then told him he lost a customer. He responded with 'get out, and don't ever come back.' I don't intend to. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I think their delivery service is pretty good, it was quick and the delivery guy was friendly. And the lady I ordered my pizza through was VERY friendly and upbeat. I've heard a lot of bad things about their workers? But I always go around noon so maybe those people are just going at the wrong time. Who knows! Now onto the food. Their pizza isn't the best pizza you'll ever have, but for the price it's good. It's a little greasy sometimes, I'll admit. But honestly I get the craving for them sometime! They have great cheese to put on their pizzas, and they usually put a good amount on. And I love their breadsticks! Yum! Like I said though, there is better. But if you're looking for cheap, quick, decent pizza I'd go here. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Had dinner here and the food was good but the service needed to be improved. We ordered the Peking duck and it was delicious. The complimentary soup was good and the vegetables were tasty. However the biggest negative was the service. The waiters seemed like they didn't want the be there and looked like zombies. We had a 10% off coupon and when we showed it to our waiter, she told us to cut it out of the newspaper before they can take it. When they delivered the food to us, they didn't smile or seemed to acknowledge us. They just dropped off the food and left. I would not recommend this restaurant based on the service we received. The food was good, but forgettable. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Not sure why everyone is raving about this place. My husband and I just moved into the area and we were looking for a good place to enjoy good breakfast burritos that had a drive thru. We read the reviews about this place and assume we couldn't go wrong. Boy was that a mistake. I got the potato, egg and cheese and it was so dry the only thing that made it edible was my homemade salsa. My husbands chorizo burrito was so overcooked that it was inedible. Why was shocking because I have never seen him put food aside no matter how bad. We couldn't believe that they would put out food that was such poor quality. He works in the food industry and commented that if one of his employees ever served food that bad he would fire them. Instead of going back and giving the manager an earful we decided we would never go back. We just realized that we read all the great reviews and were burned so we decided to write an honest one in case there are any people with standards looking forward to a great meal, so they aren't greatly disappointed. That is the least we can do for fellow foodies. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Okay so I came here in Feb and they took my review down!!! So I am putting it back up. You can't take down people's reviews because you don't like what we think of your restaurant. FEB 2010 After reading numerous great reviews for this sushi bar, my fiance and I came here, ready to stuff ourselves with sushi. Worst decision EVER!!! The sushi was ok and the rolls were disgusting. The spicy tuna roll tasted like it had been pre-made and sitting in the fridge all day. The few rolls we tried that could pass as just average sushi hardly had any fish. They were mostly rice and vegetables. We kept trying different rolls hoping that it would be amazing like all the reviews had stated but we were so, so wrong. We left with a $100 bill and still hungry. Whoever wrote that this place was a top restaurant obviously does not know what good food tastes like. We love Sushi Fever, but like others have written it is a little over-priced which is why we chose Naked Fish. We were shocked that we spent more money than we've ever spent at Sushi Fever for gross, grocery store quality sushi. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We go to PF Changs at least once every couple of months. I have never been disappointed by their food. Their orange peel shrimp is the bomb. We like it extra spicy. You can ask for white and brown rice. The black pepper prawns served with the mustard sauce are amazing but are best eaten fresh right over there. They get all soggy if you do takeout. Have you ever eaten their desserts? Try the Great Wall of Chocolate. It is huge. One order is good for like 6 people. Or if you are a chocolate lover like me...maybe good for just one. Giggles... The service is sometimes not up to par but eventually it all works out. Lately it hasn't been that busy when we go, even on weekends but it is always good to call about half an hour before you get there on weekend nights because you never know how long the wait is going to be.

 They have a good selection of Fuente related cigars here....opus, fuentes, ashtons etc. The prices are of course high but if you are here already you might as well spring for something fancy. They are cool with you bringing your own cigars too as long as you buy drinks. I'm 50/50 on bringing my own cigar or buying something there. Most of the drinks on the menu are pretty good (i think i've tried all their mixed drinks by now :).... but their mojitos are the best. Realistically this place isn't anything fancy. There is a small bar inside, and i think maybe 2 tables inside? I only sat inside once. Outside they have a small indoor patio type area with a few tables. Tip: They have one hot waitress that works there, I believe her name is Alicia? I'm usually at Casa Fuente on a Saturday and she's always there. I've on occasion been there on a Friday and she wasn't working. Just a FYI :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 I occasionally lead tour groups of young, fun foreigners to Las Vegas, and getting them all (especially the dudes) into a club is always a hassle. I've worked with countless promoters in Vegas with some seriously mixed results. Then a coworker discovered Chris Hornak, and our company's troubles with Vegas have vanished. He always knows the spots worth going to no matter what night of the week we arrive, and I'm amazed that with a handshake at the rope he can get a group of 50 people into a club. Not only inside, but VIP line access for no charge! If he's that good with a huge group, than I can only imagine what he can do for small parties.

 My wife & I stopped by for a drink after eating at the other Hash House. We accidentally went to the wrong place. The other place was good too, but we really want to try this place's food. It was extremely busy here. People were waiting outside to get seated. Once we went inside, we noticed what the hype was all about. All the food portions are huge. Everything looked really good. Too bad we couldn't try the food since we were full. We ended up going to the bar to grab a drink which took for ever. The waitress was really busy trying to keep up with all the orders. She at least acknowledge that we were waiting to be helped. We decided to have a Hash House Bloody Mary. They have a good selection of drinks. The Bloody Mary tasted really good.

Actually the only time I have seen them take someone from the line to help is when told to do so by the manager.

 Going to keep it simple. Pro's Atmosphere- very good job. TV's everywhere. Service-friendly-pretty ladies Beer is definitely cold! Menu is limited. We ordered a variety of stuff that came out ok(bar food).Portions, price ok . We had sandwiches which were fine and a Cobb Salad. Con's For lasting power in an area with lots of bars and competition they need to cater to the locals- - No Happy Hour - limited menu - No advertised food or drink specials -Not open 24hrs - Pricey for drinks -UFC $10 per person- but they carry it. -limited wine menu-really not much at all and horrible selection. -No pitchers of beer or bottles of wine for purchase. -Football season will be interesting because all other places offer specials during the games.

 I tried out this restaurant last Saturday night for the 1st time and I was very impressed. Our table had the loaded tater tots and blue cheese chips as appetizers and they were both very tasty! They had jambalaya on the menu as a special for the night and it was DELICIOUS! My friends were very pleased with their choices, as well. The atmosphere was great. I don't think there was one direction you could look without seeing a TV, which made it great to watch the football game. As far as service goes, it was excellent! It was our server's first day working at DB's Tavern. Our table had a number of questions about menu items. She knew the answer to most of them, but if she didn't then she quickly found out and reported back to us and she had nothing but a smile on her face the entire night! She was on top of everything throughout our dining experience. Our glasses never got empty before she asked if we needed more. It may sound strange, but that is an important factor to me when I am dining somewhere. I don't like having an empty glass. Nikki took very good care of us.

 If you are at all serious about rare books, don't bother with this place. Although it's fun to browse, I collect antiquarian texts and have been to many stores like this as well as the annual trade shows. I'll never come back. My issues: 1) PRICE - I specialize in 19th and 20th century texts, so I can't comment on the pricing of older items. But from what I can tell, the mark-ups here are insane. (Anywhere from 40% to 100% over the prices you'll find if you run a quick Google search.) If you actually want to buy anything, you would do much better going through eBay or any independent (but ABAA-licensed!) dealer. 2) TOUCHING THE BOOKS - Maybe I just had bad luck, but the man working here would not let me touch any of the items in the glass cases. Allowing potential customers to touch the items that interest them is standard in this industry. While I understand that this store probably gets more foot traffic than any antiquarian bookstore in the country, they clearly had the supplies on hand (gloves, foam supports) so that customers could touch the books if the staff deemed them worthy. I suspect that the man who worked here did not take me seriously because I am in my twenties. Although I was dressed business-casual (was on my way to dinner), you'd think I was Julia Roberts at the beginning of Pretty Woman. Big mistake. Big. Huge! I have to go shopping now. 3) STAFF - On a related note, the guy working here was incredibly patronizing, again (I suspect) because of my age. He didn't seem to know much about the David Foster Wallace book I was interested in (fair enough, everyone has their specialties). But instead of answering my question or admitting he didn't know the answer, he launched into a spiel about why we put mylar covers on dust jackets. Compelling. When I asked about the provenance of a book, he told me that it came from a ""private individual"" and that he couldn't give me any more information than that because of privacy concerns. Fine. But then he added that it's ""typical"" for antiquarian booksellers not to give customers any information about where they got the books--which is objectively not true. I have worked with a number of rare booksellers and ""typically"", they bend over backwards to give me information about what I'm looking at (all while respecting the privacy of the person they got the book from, obviously). And even if they don't have that info, they would never make me feel bad for asking. The impression I came away with was that Bauman does not care at all about their customers--not enough to charge them fair prices, and not enough to treat them with respect when they visit the store. Such a shame. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is a great place to go during your lunch break or after a busy day when you feel like getting lost within many, many books! (Indeed, many lecturers from Edinburgh University have been spotted in here after a busy day in the lecture theatres). There is just something about browsing in an independent small book store which separates the experience from looking at a Waterstones or Blackwells. Located close by to George Square, this book shop is full of useful books for students of social and political science. As a political student myself, I found this shop to stock many specialist books which are not available at the main book stores. Books covering Scottish politics and left wing politics (This is a key feature in this shop as Jonny and Lynsey have already highlighted!) are well supplied in Word Power Books. The prices do not compete with discount rates on Amazon, but I really don't mind paying that when it is in an independent book shop! Keep the independent book shop alive, and dive into the literature on offer in Word Power Books! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Mmmm Cafe Vettro... You're a 3.74 in my book, but I still can't round you up. As many others have said, the service here (albeit friendly) is slow. I can't imagine what it would be like when the place is packed. Food wise, my meal was really good! I got the grilled vegetable burrito, available under the speciality sandwich section - haha. Three words: more Oaxaca cheese. This is what makes the burrito people. Ask for extra, trust. At $14, it's a wallet thinner. Since you are already spending an arm, you might as well spend a leg on their juice. The watermelon juice was very good. I would come back just for the juice. This is was the first time I bothered to read their menu/info tablet and this place is open 24 hours. Good to know at 4 am when everything else in Aria seems to be closed. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I always order the same thing at Baidu, so take that into account with this review. But my usual order is delicious, and just as importantly for a Chinese restaurant, consistent. Their scallion pancake is a stellar appetizer, a Szechwan specialty that can be challenging to find in Vegas. Thin pastry layers have green onion flattened in between them. It's maybe more of a frybread texture than a flapjack. It's served with a soy ginger dipping sauce that's best used sparingly. Pork fried rice is my favorite Chinese dish. I know that's not very adventurous, but I don't care. Good pork fried rice is one of life's simple pleasures. Baidu's is, for starters, served in portions that strain the sides and top of the to-go cartons. The pork is mostly lean and a rich red color from the BBQ treatment. The vegetables are cooked to tenderness, like in a pilaf. The rice is just the right mix of fried and moist, with enough seasoning that you don't need to add soy, I find it well complemented by the searing hot mustard available on request. My new go-to for Chinese. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place is great. Classy, chill, centrally located and open late. The service was terrific, the pizza margherita was wonderful and the drinks were stiff without being obnoxious. I had the pomegranate julep and the $5 gin martini, both great. If you're by yourself, you will feel comfortable here. This is so not a meat market. It's not a cafe, but it's also not a skeezy bar. I did dock one star for the guy who ""greeted"" me when I walked in. I was by myself, not looking terribly put together, with a backpack and casual clothes. He didn't seem too hyped to seat me and that left a bad taste in my mouth, until the very sweet server (Jeanett, I think) took over. Then it was all good from there.

 Yeah, not impressed. We ordered the fried zucchini to start. It's great that it's freshly hand battered, but they seem to have forgotten something -- the FLAVOR. This stuff had no seasoning on it at all, so we have to pour on a generous helping of salt to get it to taste like anything. And for $8 that's disappointing. We each ordered burgers. At $10 a pop I was expecting a nice juicy burger. What I got was dry and totally tasteless. The whole burger just tasted like nothing. Perhaps their salt shaker fell on the floor and rolled under the fridge or something tonight. It was accompanied by some typical frozen steak fries. Again NO SALT OR SEASONING. For a $40 night out I really shouldn't have to dump salt all over everything I order. The service...meh. Our server was so meek I could barely hear her. Serving takes a bit of personality, no? When we asked what the happy hour specials were, she said ""Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....it depends on the drink."" What? What does that mean? Basically it means you get a random discount on whatever you order, maybe, perhaps. There is no list, no standard ""$5.00 well drinks"" or anything normal like that. It's basically ""order something and hope it's on our happy hour specials."" Rather disappointed. They need to either lower their prices or kick it up a notch on the food and service. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Once a month we are in this area for the past 6 years, and we have never ventured to Hayashi. I was tired of eating Chick-fil-a and needed a change. Well today was the day... This is a really neat setting with the food preparation in from of you, this is only for dinner. For lunch we were directed to the bar area. I am not a sushi person and its seems that they specialize in that. I do however like California Rolls. Unfortunately, the Rolls were not served chilled like I am assuming they should be. They were made fresh, but the items inside were not chilled. Room temp at most. I ordered Shrimp Tempura and they were ok. Everything on my plate was fried. It said I get veggies with my shrimp tempura and I got Veggies in a batter fried. Kinda grease overload. Our service on the other hand was great. He was attentive and took time to explain and questions I had. This is what was stopping the decline to 1 star. I would like to try the Family style dinner with the chef sometime and maybe that will swing my review some. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The Bellagio Pool Cafe is delicious but expensive... under a nice covered area, you can enjoy a wide variety of lunch options in your swimsuit and towel. By the time we sat down around 2:30 pm, I was starving so I ended up sampling everyone else's food in addition to my own. I had the teriyaki chicken lettuce wraps ($12.50) that came with cold noodles, pickled, veggies, and hoisen sauce. They were really yummy and a good amount of food. My uncle enjoyed the Cobb salad (about $14) that included fresh tomatoes (red and yellow), delicious avocado, etc. My brother and dad shared a tuna sandwich and a turkey sandwich with fries and cole slaw. Everyone appreciated their lunch selections and left the Cafe satisfied and happy. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Came here today for a late lunch to check off another burger place off my list. Now I'll start off with having a really nice server and a really nice, if blue, atmosphere. I had decided to ride my bike there today, to work off the burger pounds I'm probably putting on, and they let me take it inside. The place was mostly empty, but still a really nice gesture so I didn't have to leave my really expensive bike outside. They filled up my water really fast as well and were very attentive. Strange thing was that I seemed to get served by 2 people, so they both asked me the same things one after another. I ordered the blu burger ($12) and can say that it could be a lot better for the price. The toppings of onion, bacon and Gorgonzola cheese were really tasty and savory. Mine didn't come with an onion bun that I could tell but still was a really nice bun to eat. I think that bun might be the best one I've had so far during my burger adventures. Unfortunately, the meat patty was extremely underwhelming. I don't know why they bothered asking me how I want my patty done (medium) because the thin ~1/4"" patty was well done yet still lukewarm. There wasn't much texture to it either. These things are really expensive too! Usually this price will get you a burger and fries at least, but it costs something like $5 for fries. That's the price of a burger and fries at some other places. I'd be curious to try their kobe patty to see if it was any better, but probably not anytime soon. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I would have given Northpoint negative stars if it was possible. I wished have reviewed Anne H. posting before signing up with Northpoint. What she experienced was a tip-of-an-iceberg compare to us. We have similar experiences as Anne and more. Our company resides outside Arizona and have many homes Phoenix metropolitan area. We hired Northpoint based on their website claims and telephone interviews, which they made many promises. Good sales, but worst execution. - Extremely unorganized. Every properties we have ended up with tenant problems, extensive repairs, un-reconcilable charges, unjustified charges, and/or falsified issues. Yes, they falsified claims, invoices, and correspondences. - They lied to us constantly. We only found out after months of probing their claims. - They falsified repairs with duplicate invoices of SAME NUMBERS and SAME PROPERTIES (plural intended) and charge us month-over-month. Only after we questioned them, they removed some of the charges. - They failed to disclose that they were using their own employees to conduct repairs. Hence, constant repairs and claims were experienced by us. Of course they over-charged us as well. Worst yet, they would falsify claims, repairs, and created invoices, and charge us. We caught them do it. - In the aftermath, we found many repairs that Northpoint claimed were created to keep their repair crew busy. - Due to these falsified repairs and claims, they were having hard time producing proper records that we need for our bookkeeping. Months have passed since we terminated them. They still were unable to produce records for our bookkeeping. There were so many illegal and/or unethical practices by them, we finally gave up using them. We lost thousands of dollars using them. We would have filed a claim against them if the lost (time and money) justifies it. Just like Anne, we also have many rental properties in Phoenix and other states. We had some bad experiences with some property managers, but this is beyond words. We have never experienced this type of negligent and crooked practices.

 I have been waiting to try this place for months now. Purchased a Local Dines coupon and went the other day for lunch. First impression was a little strange as there is no table service. You are pleasantly greeted by a nice hard working elderly lady who instructs you to order at the window and then take a seat while your food is prepared. Once the food is ready she beckons to you from across the room so that you can come pick up your food in the window. Not sure if this is just a lunch thing and if dinner service has a different system but once I understood how the system worked it was fine. As for the food... We ordered the famed bolognese ragu over linguine, chicken parm., and fettuccine alfredo. My wife had the bolognese and said it was just okay. The pasta overwhelmed the dish with very little bolognese mixed in so it was a little dry and flavorless, somewhat disappointing. The chicken parm. was actually pretty tasty in my opinion and worthy of ordering again. The fettuccine alfredo was not good at all. Very basic pasta with cream. There was no real taste at all and was a total disappointment. Overall I think that this place rides on the coattails of the triple D review from Guy Fieri. I do not understand the long lines and rave reviews to be honest. Oh, one last thing... As previously mentioned we used a Local Dines $15 for $30 worth of food coupon. When I got the bill at the end the nice older lady added up the food, deducted the coupon amount,then proceeded to add 18% gratuity to the bill based on the total amount without even asking. I have no issue with a tip, but presuming 18% when there is no real table service, just a woman beckoning to you from a window, well I thought that a bit much. Yes, she did come out from behind the window and was very nice, but it was not her position to add 18% tip to a four top table. At the end of the day this place is 35 minutes from my home and in no way justifying of the drive and a follow up visit. Sorry Giuseppe's on 28th, I wish I had found a true hole in the wall to call home, but to the contrary was disappointed with your food. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Well we all know KFC is known for ""Finger Licking Good"" but we may not always have known them for quality service. This location is in the Spectrum Mall Parking Lot that offers dine in, carry out and drive thru. I frequently visit this location to pick up lunch for the office. I have only used the drive thru once which was a quick nice experience the other times I did carry out. The interior is nice and the location is well kept with cleanliness but I have been disappointed in getting wrong orders or there not being enough chicken. The staff is very friendly and acknowledge/greet everyone who walks through the door. They great about honoring coupons and ringing in orders. Matter of fact they repeat the orders so it throws me off when my orders are wrong. My very last experience was during lunch right at 11:15am. I ordered grilled only Chicken for the office and there was not enough which was strange since I was only ordering 10 pieces. The friendly cashier told me the wait would be 20 mins so I decided to wait. He offered me a drink for my wait. Well I declined his offer even though that was a kind gesture. After playing the waiting game it took 40 mins for my chicken to be ready. Not sure why or how this would have taken so long but it did. The food was good which kept the office happy though they really need to get the service part down when it comes to the food. Once they take care of this I see more stars added to their ratings.

 We had family in town and made reservations for dinner at the Heritage Tavern. I was very excited to try this place, but came away sorely, sorely disappointed. That's not to say that there weren't some highlights, but the lowlights and moments of sheer mediocrity dominated. ATMOSPHERE: The space was very nice and the seating was comfortable. Our party of six had a great table that seemed to be both centrally located and somehow shielded from the hustle and bustle on a busy Saturday night. However, we all found it to be uncomfortably hot in the restaurant, and our wine had to be kept at least 10 feet from the table, which was odd. SERVICE: The service was somehow both warm and pretentious at the same time. The waiter promptly announced that, ""I don't have any additions to the menu tonight... I won't even use the 's-word' [specials] that other restaurants use to try to feed you repackaged leftovers."" That was the first 'are you kidding me?' moment. The second was when another waitress came to the table with a, ""dish compliments of the kitchen."" Was this some sort of innovative amuse bouche? No. It was bread. Don't get me wrong-- I'm all for serving a basket of bread, but don't act like your bestowing some amazing gift on me. It's bread. Oh, wait... it's not just bread, because for some reason the plate had to be explained to us. See that butter? It's honey butter! See that little cup with a few pickled veggies on it? That's a little cup with a few pickled veggies! And did you notice the random little pile of salt? That's ""course sea salt, to cut the sweetness of the honey butter."" (I'm not sure how you're supposed to do this-- is every member of the party supposed to lick their thumb and grab some? Somehow I managed to deal with the sweetness of the butter without doing that.) All that being said, I actually didn't mind the service. The waiter was friendly and classy, and he handled our one major issue (see below) gracefully and appropriately. APPETIZERS: I had crispy head cheese with escargot. The head cheese was fried into two little croquettes. They were light and not too dense or heavy. I wouldn't have known I was eating head cheese. The escargot, however, was completely lost in the dish. I scraped a bit off one of the croquettes and it was very good on its own, but I would have had no clue that it was even there if I had eaten everything together. Several members of the party had a beet salad. Everyone liked it. No one raved about it. In general, I thought that the appetizers were fairly successful, if not amazing. ENTREES: And here's where the wheels came off the cart. My mother ordered the Wagyu burger. It was tiny and served on the edge of an enormous plate with absolutely no garnish or accompaniment. My sister had the salmon. She said that it was, ""very fishy."" Her fiance had a sirloin. He didn't say anything about it. He's very polite. I had the bouillabaisse. It was pathetic. This is a simple dish, and it needs top quality ingredients to work. This wasn't top quality seafood. It was absolutely indistinguishable in size, taste, and texture from the stuff I can buy frozen at Woodman's. There was hardly any broth at all, and it somehow didn't taste like seafood at all. It was just vaguely salty. This dish should have never made it out of the kitchen. That wasn't the worst dish on the table, though. My wife ordered a pork chop. That was apparently sold out, but the waiter said that they could make the same dish with a pork shank. What came out was a large bone with a little sliver of meat and an ENORMOUS amount of fat. I honestly have no clue how this pig even walked on a shank link that. It was disgusting and inedible. Had they not taken it off the bill, it would have plunged this to a one star review. The only person who was happy was my father, who wasn't all that hungry and ordered the tomato soup and grilled cheese. That was one of the cheapest items on the menu. In sum, they sent out three mediocre entrees and two completely unacceptable entrees. Was the food bad? Not really. Was it anywhere close to what I would have expected for the very high prices? Not in a million years. I haven't had such a disappointing meal in some time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 After taking my two rescue dogs here for about 1year my opinions have changed. They all have been very nice and good to my animals. My dogs get yearly exams, shots, and one teeth cleaning. They have always taken their time with me and answered my questions during the exam. Nice. The two questions two of the vets couldn't answer were not followed up on like they said they would. Not the end of the world. However, this summer I was informed by the office manager and Dr. Varela that he would not be taking either of my dogs into the back without giving the the optional Bordatella shot. Their 'new office policy', sent down from above. They gave a handful of reasons and Varela got uppity and scowly with me so I quickly debated. Went ahead with it because I wanted to get the inexpensive procedure done on one of the dogs that day, and pick up the free coupon RX diet food for the other. Fine. The procedure done on one, two trips into the back room for weights & measuring for the other to get her free food and I was out the door. Do you think I had to pay for a Bordatella for the other dog who went back twice? THEY DIDN'T EVEN ASK! How ""mandatory"" could an optional/voluntary Bordatella shot be if they don't even follow their own regulations? Shouldn't the pet owner be able to decide this? I think all pets should have their legally required shots and surgeries! The rest is at my discretion, as I see the need for. Especially when Bordatella is designed to prevent kennel cough when dogs are boarded. Boarding my dogs? Never! Bordatella shots are currently $10.00 and last 6 months. Each dog X 2 shots yearly per each pet owner = you do the math and watch your pocket book! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I wouldn't even give the Bell Road Mazda Service Dep't ONE star, except thats the only choice I have. I thought I was in good hands, because my mom had been working with Pete since he was at Hyundai when she owned a vehicle with them, and now serviced her Mazda at this dealership where he worked. Well, I took the vehicle in for the oil change in September, to be told the motor mount is cracked BUT covered under warranty. They did not have the part in at that time, but Pete assured me it was covered under warranty and to let him know when I have the time to bring the car back in. No big deal, until I drive away and realize the tech BROKE the Left/Right toggle switch to adjust the side mirrors, and shoved the driver side vent adjuster clean into the dash somehow. I called Pete right away and came back. He peeked his head inside the car and I showed him the issues, and he felt the mirror switch was broken, then manually adjusted the passenger mirror for me so I could drive safely. I did not have another hour & 1/2 to wait for them to fix this, so Pete assured me they would take care of it at my next visit. Here it is December, I have a little time to bring it in, and Pete no longer works there. I explained in detail to John Friedman what happened, thinking the issue would be easily resolved as Pete said. John reached out to Pete, who remembers my mom, remembers me, my last visit with the car, but conveniently DOES NOT remember the switch being broken, the vent adjuster, OR manually adjusting my mirror for me, and did NOT note my account regarding the part # of the cracked motor mount OR TAT IT WAS CRACKED! So basically, I am being called a liar about their tech breaking the switch, AND the motor mount can't be called in until they have the car there, to see which part it is. So there's a good chance I will have to sit there only to be told they don't have the part. And now, I will have to pay for the part their tech broke and who knows about the warranty covering the motor mount since the mileage is drastically different by thousands. THUMBS DOWN. Do NOT expect to be taken care of if they do something wrong. As adults, most of us learn to take responsibility for what we do wrong, and to do a good job at whatever we do-like noting someone's account properly... but not The Chapman Mazda Service Dep't. Now I will be taking my vehicle to the Camelback location from now until I sell the Mazda and wash my hands with the company. Wish me luck...

 I really had high hopes for this place and plan on giving it a second try after they have worked out the kinks. The space is great, the bartender was super friendly (dirty martini was delicious), the menu looks enticing and everyone's food around me seemed to be tasty but my calamari a la plancha was slimy and rubbery, my scallops were overcooked (but the broth they were in was amazing - wish there was more) and the salad was overdressed. The service was...awkward - the hostess sat us in a corner of the chef's bar and explained that we couldn't sit in the other open seats where you can see them preparing the food because it's first come first serve (??). But, given that, they're a new restaurant and maybe a newer cook prepared my food. Will give it another shot in a few months and probably go there just for drinks in the meantime. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I love going to get my hair done at Boujis! It is so welcoming. While the salon is current with all the latest styles and trends, you don't feel put off by attitude. Dona, the owner, always greets you with a smile and knows you by name. One of my favorite things about Boujis is that they do not let clients walk back on a whim to talk to the stylists and interrupt them while they work. My time is my time! Okay, call me selfish, but I like having the undivided attention of Ainslie when she is working her magic on my hair! The other thing I love about Boujis is that the salon is light and bright, so when Ainslie colors my hair, we're looking at it with natural light, not the artificial light mimiced in many salons these days. Speaking of Ainslie, I give her an A+. I am a pretty easy client, and I like to change up my look, but when my hair doesn't need color, and I insist that I want it, she does not give in! She truly cares not only about the look she creates, but also the health of your hair. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We went to this restaurant after learning of it from Diners Drive Ins and Dives TV show. The food was FANTASTIC! Love the little place and the atmosphere. However, the menu is a bit pricey as it was $70 dollars for two persons (including desert and appetizer). In all, a very pleasant experience and the good was very good! ",0,0,0,1,0

 When I walked in I was greeted promply and asked how I heard about the restaurant. I told her my car was a few doors down getting some maintenance done and I just happened to walk by. The owner told me this place just opened a week ago (04/08/11) The place is well decorated and has a huge TV hanging on one wall, the music is traditional mexican which complements the bright colors and Mexican decor. This is a great place for lunch, late breakfast or dinner, reasonably priced, good food and service with a smile. The hours: Open Monday through Saturday 9am to 9pm Location: North East corner of Hardy and Broadway Menu: Burritos $5.49 with choice of tortillas: flour, wheat, tomato basil and choice of Carne Asada (Grilled Steak), Pollo Asado (Grilled Chicken), Barbacoa (Shredded Beef), Adobada (Pulled Pork) and Carnitas (Pork) They have rice, black or brown beans, jack cheese, sour cream, roasted chile corn salsa, romain lettuce and different salsas from mild to spicy. They also offer Tacos with the same meat options for $1.25 each, Taco Salad for $5.99, Quesadillas (open face) for $4.49 with meat for $1 more and Nachos for $5.99 ",0,0,0,1,0

 Great service and good food. The atmosphere left something to be desired, as well as the late 90's pop music, but nothing that would keep us from coming back. We will definitely be back next time we are in town. The 'hot' definitely took a bite out of my mother-in-law who likes spicy food. They also have a 'thai hot' that should really get you. We found the food rich and flavorful unlike some places where the flavors are watered down. We enjoyed the spring rolls, tom kha soup (chicken), curry noodles (chicken), garlic saute (chicken), and thai iced tea. All were excellent. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Now, my poor rating could possibly be from what i ordered, but that wasn't the full story. I ordered the sliders which came with 3 small different burgers. None of them impressed me much, they were cooked medium which is the only choice for sliders but it was only medium in the very center, the rest was a little too cooked (probably due to the small size). The Hostess seemed extremely unhappy when I arrived with my friends and when i left i said bye, she bid me farewell with the same sad state of emotion... kinda killed it. As i was saying, the burgers lacked any ""interesting"" flavors despite the delicious description in the menu. The sliders were quite small and overall just didn't impress me as far as taste. Even though each burgers used different beef, they all tasted much the same. Presentation was pretty and the fat fries were pretty good but that just didn't cut it for a $20+ bill... i was gonna go for the ballin 60 dollar burger with truffles etc but opted not to at the last moment. Now im curious how that would have been. hahaha ",0,0,1,0,0

 Finally had a chance to make it over to the new location--pretty awesome! For what it's worth, I think they are, without a doubt, the best brewery in the entire state. Cool digs, free pool and great beer. They had a one-off on tap when I went--a very drinkable session beer which (I think) was classified as a Belgian pale ale. It was nice, had subtle hints of coriander and orange, and was totally delicious. Ballistic was the standout--you know, because IPAs are where they shine. I will absolutely go back for food. Until then--Ale Asylum's brews will continue to remain in my fridge. ",0,0,0,1,0

 So I have to eat healthy says my doctor & my high blood pressure. So I was told thru the great vine that BFG cooks up good chicken. God I hate rumors and this is a perfect example as to why I cant stand a bunch of she said he said they said we said. Looks can be deceiving this is a very true statement. Anyway once in side the BFG it was packed so I felt good that this was a good decision to come here. I'm thinking its so packed in here this is going to be so good. Boy was I wrong. So we order food yes the husband was with me. Chicken mac & cheese ( Please see my pictures) along with other items. I have to tell you guys this was nothing but a mind game. I am still asking myself how can the line be outside if the food does not taste like anything. Its flavor less. It taste like it came from a common school cafeteria ewww! It took me back to elementary, middle school & high school. I looked at my husband and said I should have packed my own lunch. lol On my way out I saw a sticker from YELP by the front door I wondered if I was being punked and I also wondered if Ashton Kutcher would jump out from behind a car with a camera crew. Some one fooled YELP this food gets a big fat zero I wish I could take the one star back. They get a negative zero. I'm still at a lost for words on how they got the yelp sticker on the door.

 Food is good although they are always trying to rush me through and keep trying to wrap up my burrito before I'm done adding stuff. It's like they don't want me to see everything I can add to my burrito. Also last time I put lettuce in my burrito so they would not give me any on the side ... Wtf ? I would strongly advise them on getting a salsa bar, that would be a deal breaker for me. I will not be returning unless it's heavily discounted or they add a salsa bar. Over all food is decent although every time I go there somehow they piss me off which is rare for a restaurant to do. ",0,1,0,0,0

 4.5 stars I've noticed some of the reviews stated the service wasn't all that great. I can tell you from our dining experience, it was fantastic. From start to finish the staff were great... no issues... and very informative. The food... If you haven't been to Spago, they have two menus. One is for fine dining, the other is for casual dining. We went the fine dining route. I had the beef tar tare (a first for me) and it was delicious. My wife tried it and loved it as well. She had the white asparagus special. Another winner of a dish. Main course... I had the American Wagyu steak, it was served on a bed of spinach and mushrooms. The side dish was a semolina fondue with black truffle. The steak... it was sous vide @135 degrees for 72 hours. It's hard to describe how amazing the steak was. It melted in your mouth like pork belly but with a great steak flavor. I was able to cut it with my fork. The texture and how it melts in your mouth is nothing short of amazing. I highly recommend you order this steak. Best steak I've had to date. My wife had the roasted chicken with goat cheese which was on mashed potatoes and brown gravy. Comfort food galore! I tried it... loved it... she loved the meal as well. Deserts... I had chocolate bread pudding which also had passion fruit. This is where 1/2 a star was deducted. I thought the desert was tiny and the passion fruit didn't go well with the rest of the dish. My wife had a peanut butter souffle. Another great dish... well worth ordering. All in all we had a fantastic dinner with great food and great service. I would highly recommend you give this place a try. Do order the steak I mentioned... it's simply fantastic. A couple of drinks, a few bottles of water, appetizers, main course, desert = $240+$40 tip $280 total. (ouch) but tasty. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have been going to this salon since September of 2012 and there is a reason I keep going back. I get my nails done every four weeks with the gel polish. they do my nails so well and are quick about it. they put creative designs on my nails and the price is just right. They also, shape my nails, and file them down, not just rush me through as fast as they can so they can get more customers. Since Christmas the same woman has been doing my nails and she always does a GREAT job! My only complaint is that they don't have the largest selection of gel polish colors, but I'm sure they are always getting more. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My favorite Target store in town for many reasons... The store is always clean. They have a huge selection. The grocery store has EVERYTHING. The prepared foods/deli section can save me from cooking for days. I love the huge selection of household storage. The checkout is painless. They always have a good number of lanes open so I never have to wait in long lines. I'm even impressed with the short wait I had to return something during holiday season. I wish they could improve the parking situation. The lot is huge, but the store is at a narrow end where there is less parking. That means there are plenty of spots to park, but they are all far from the door. Good thing rain is rare. It would make the walk to the car pretty bad. Five stars for the store, 2 stars for the parking... ",0,0,0,1,0

 Was on a birthday weekend trip with some friends. I have rented from RTR online previously with good experiences, and had walked by the storefront on a previous trip. Unfortunately, I was unimpressed. The selection is minimal, and some of the dresses show significant wear. For example, there was a dress hanging up that had significant pilling on it; so much that it looked like something from Goodwill instead of a runway caliber dress. Another was missing a bunch of sequins. I was also unhappy with the fact that only some of the dresses display rental pricing, and that the pricing is (at least for all the dresses we picked out) was the same as on the website. Not terrible, until you remember that the website rents for 5 days, versus 1 night in store. In the future, I'll stick to renting online simply because I know I'll find something. If you're planning a trip to the store, make sure you have brought a back up dress in case you can't find anything. I still gave 3 stars because everyone was very helpful and friendly. I found a dress I loved, but nothing ended up being right for a Vegas night out, so I didn't get anything. Furthermore, none of the sales people were pushy when I finally gave up, and they didn't try to force a rental on me. ",0,0,1,0,0

 If you're looking for a place to eat fish on the west side, I'd definitely recommend McGrath's. I've eaten here several times, most recently last week. My biggest pet peeve about most fish served in restaurants is that it's overcooked, but McGraths's fish is always moist and fresh tasting. I'm counting calories, and they offered the veggies and potatoes ""naked"", without any sauce, but still very good. The wine selection isn't very extensive, but I'd say that was my only complaint. Just remember this is the desert, and keep the expectations realistic. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Decent enough movie theater if you decide to go during the day, but forget about it if you go at night and to see the new release of a popular movie. My wife and I went to see Paranormal Activity 3 last night. Unfortunately, we only got to hear about 1/3 of the movie for the constant running commentary and unnecessary screaming. When I complained to the management that they needed to get the audience under control, the response I received from a Charlotte police officer was ""what do you want me to do, there's 250 of them in there"". When I spoke to the manager, her response was, ""what do you expect on opening night of a horror movie; there's nothing I can do to stop it"". Furthermore, the officer then stated, ""This is why we recommend that normal adults who actually want to see the movie don't come out on opening weekend."" When another member of the audience asked for a refund for the same reason, the theater manager stated, ""We don't give refunds. If the audience was being disruptive, you could have come and told us."" This was AFTER she said there was nothing they could, or would, do about it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Wow, how the LA counterpart allows this place to keep using the Pink's name is beyond me. The first time I went when it opened I was like meh. The second time I went last month I was like wth!!! I don't see this place lasting with it never having people there it seems. The chili is pretty spot on to being the same as well as the dogs but man everything else is just horrible. I mean I got a crusted tortilla wrapper that was litterarly cracking and breaking as if it was a cracker. It's almost like they left the tortilla sitting on the counter all night and decided to use it anyways. I mean if you are going to bring a prized LA landmark like this to LA then do it right. I mean In-N-Out and Tommy's do it right. It's just a downright shame for Pink's. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We almost bailed on this place because of the NY reviewers below but realized they had posted on like every possible reviewing site, and were soooo ""angry"" that we decided they had some personal vendetta towards the restaurant to go through the process of posting the same complaint to sooo many sites. Thinking of how many people eat there every evening and theirs being the worst review led us to roll the dice. We had heard about this from the Andrew Zimmern Montreal episode but when I tried making reservations over a month out it kept giving me an option beyond our travel dates. A few days before we left, I tried calling and to my surprise they offered us a late evening reservation. We were excited. On the day of, we actually ended up arriving almost 45 minutes early (figured we would walk around if they wouldn't take us but they quickly led us to our table. The restaurant was busy but not as ""tight"" fitting as some of these reviews had led me to believe. We were greeted by an informative waitress who quickly switched to english to deal with us. Sadly for her, it seemed every table that came in after us in her section was American so I felt bad for her as most tables struggled to read the chalkboard menu and needed extensive help. We were crazy enough to bring our teen daughters along but she was sweet and patient with us as we had her make recommendations. We decided to have the girls try sea whelk which they were hesitant about but ended up loving. Then based on a recommendation went with the rib steak (for 2) to split among the four of us as our main entree. We are SOOOO lucky we only got that because the rib steak was so big that even with all 4 of us having some, we actually ended up leaving two slices of the meat that we couldn't finish. The meat was very flavorful and each of us loved it. It came with a smoked sausage that was wonderful. The only complaint was the main dish came with a side that was a baked celery root and it was sooooo salty we could not eat it. Overall, a great experience! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Milo's was a bit of a letdown. I'd read the reviews on Yelp and was excited to check it out, but the food just did not deliver. I went there on a Saturday night with Arnab M: the place was pretty crowded but emptying as it was getting late, so we got a table right away. The food is American with various influences. I ordered one of the specials that day: duck breast with sauteed vegetables, mashed sweet potatoes and roasted pears (which by the way was almost identical to a dish I had at Escobar's in Champaign, see my review). I thought the duck was a little tough and overcooked, and the sides lacked flavor. Arnab had the Moroccan salmon: again the salmon was okay but the sides were disappointing. For the price (close to $20 per entree), I'm sure I can better dining options in town. Btw, the place is kind of hard to find. It's on NE corner of the Lincoln Square Mall, and it took us a little while to find it. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have been here a couple times now and it's definitely a place to check out. As so many yelpers have already mentioned, the chopped salad is delicious. Definitely something to try at Citizen. Also, the pastrami!!! Oh man, that was so melt in your mouth yummy! Smaller portion, probably not a meal for most but it was so good I would order it again. The lamb burger is a huge meal that comes with perfectly crispy scrumptious fries. The patty isn't cut down with beef or pork so the flavor is very game-y which can be a good thing if you are into that. I wasn't quite so used to it. :) I also tried a bit of my friend's Smart Chicken which was amazingly tender and juicy and perfectly seasoned! Also, really organic and fresh which I love. I tried the Citi-zen mixed drink which was very lemony and a bit on the sour side. I wasn't in love with the flavor. I did however love the rock candy that came with it. lol. The service was awesomeeeeee!!! We came in near closing but they still happily sat us instead of shooing us away. Our waiter was very attentive, answered all our questions about the menu and made some great suggestions. He also took us on a tour of the speak easy style bar upstairs which was super interesting! Apparently you go around the side of the building and there's a posting of ""the rules"". You call the number and if they have room you will be let up to this chic modern bar.

 I went here twice. First, I came on a Monday night to sample their 50 cent wings (I tried the Hawaiian BBQ sauce). It was good enough, but it tasted a little dry and plain. The french fries, however, were delicious. I ordered them plain and they were incredibly tasty. So I gave it another shot. I came back on a Wednesday because they had a full rack of ribs for half off. Once again, it was good, but it tasted a little dry. So be sure to ask for extra sauce of your choice regardless of what you order. With the extra sauce, the ribs were great, and the price can't be beat. One day I'll actually come back to sample their pizza. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I pulled up and the guys who wrote me up was very pleasant and let me know that the $15.99 car wash was on special for $12.99 so I said what the heck. The rest of the staff was also very polite but my problem is with the actual wash. We had gone camping the day before and the interior was a little dusty. My car was only about 10 days old so it was pretty clean save the dust. I gave the guy a tip without really checking the car but when I got home from the front seats back the car still had a layer of dust on it. I got a damp cloth wan wiped it down and now it looks like it should have. If I wanted to clean the interior my self I would have gone to the $3.00 car wash.

 I've found that the mark of a good Italian restaurant is how well they make you a spaghetti bolognese. It seems to be the simplest of Italian dishes that encompasses everything good about Italian food. A well done pasta and a tasty meat sauce that is spiced just right - something basic that mama teaches you.I know - it's a stupid rule but one that has worked for me nonetheless. My bolognese at this joint came in lumpy and absent of taste. The waitstaff take their time to get to you (and it wasn't busy at all) unless they are bringing you the cheque. My wife ordered the veal and it was overdone. We had a third person in our party that ordered a eggplant parm (which is pretty much the only vegetarian thing they had) - and that was done relatively well. I can see the charm in wanting to eat here - but it's just not worth the price in my humble estimation. I've eaten good Italian food in Italy, NYC, Philadelphia and L.A. I am yet to find a place that matches that definition in Las Vegas. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Have to write a quick update because this week I visited FEZ twice with my in-laws since they are in town. After picking them up from the airport, I took them to FEZ for brunch - this was my first time trying the brunch and I can say for certain that I will be back. Loved my breakfast panini and it was just the right amount of food. My in-laws loved the frittata and eggs benedict. After being wowed by brunch, my in-laws insisted on going back for dinner. The $5 martinis on Tuesday night were awesome - my mother in law is determined to figure out the apricot martini so she can make them at home! As always the FEZ burger, the rosemary chicken sandwich, and sweet potato fries were delish. According to my inlaws the lamb kisra was great and heated up well the next day for lunch.

 Our family read about this great event and decided to give it a try - sounded fun! We purchased our tickets the day before which was a good thing because they were sold out. We arrived at 530 pm and there was ample parking. We headed to the gate and entered in the e-ticket line where I had to hear about how frustrating it was to scan the phone (then don't take e-tickets!). The lady at the front gate handing out maps was super friendly and really took time to make our 2 year old feel welcome and even got him a little wrist band like the rest of us had. We entered and people were just standing around. This was the theme for the night - lack of movement. We headed down the trails and it felt like I was a rat in a maze just looking for my way out. The trails were so congested that it was hard to move and to pull the little wagon I had the kiddos in. At first I felt bad about clogging up the narrow trails with my wagon but (1) it was better than letting them run loose and burning down the whole place or burning themselves and (2) the large scooters that were being rented out took up more room than my wagon. This was, in my opinion, not a very kid friendly event. My 4 year old kept asking why we had taken them there and after about 10 minutes I was wondering the same. There was live music but that still wasn't enough to bring up the star rating. The stations to purchase beverages were nice but also blocking access to getting around. I will agree with others that it is a beautiful thing to see -- but I would not go back - ever. The $30 price tag is way too steep for what this is. In New Mexico there is a shuttle tour that takes you through neighborhoods that decorate with luminarias and that is $3. Would I return? No way. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I finally got my wish to stay at Luxor . I was happy to get a room within the pyramid so that I could see the effect of the slanted windows, another one of those dumb little things I get so excited about. Other than a little water damage around the window, the room was pretty nice. There wasn't much to indicate that Luxor opened way back in 1993. The wardrobe was comically Egyptian themed. I'm impressed with how much is stuffed into the Luxor atrium. The entertainment possibilities are endless. I wish I had the time to visit the Titanic Artifact exhibit. It looked interesting. I liked the color scheme on the casino floor. Creamy white, blue and silver are a great combination and such a difference from many of the other casinos. The elevators at Luxor are almost Wonka-like in that they travel in an angle up and down the corners of the pyramid. Luxor actually calls them inclinators. If you're not expecting the semi-sideways movement, you might find yourself performing and impromptu balancing act. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I had a horrible experience at the Marquee Day Club with its small pool and their fantastic ability to stuff people in like sardines. There's nothing better than to come to a spacious pool, good looking people, and best of all: you don't even have to try to look good. Just grab a drink and relax in the pool, pot belly goes under water folks ;), and waddle in the water to good music. If you come with a bad ratio of guys and girls (bad, meaning that having men in your group diminish your chances of getting in for free), I would recommend contacting a promoter about your ratio and then come very early, before noon, to avoid the $50-$60 cover charge for men. But generally, girls get in for $30 if you can't get in for the promotion price. Oh, and if you're worried about fitting your lunch plans prior to pool time, they have a grill there that serves food. Drinks are fairly expensive, as they regularly are in Las Vegas clubs. The only thing to complain: I know the pools are heated, but the water is slightly too warm for the amount of people, which makes me think that the water is warm for other reasons :( But I definitely would do this again on my next trip(s), Summa Summa time! - Will Smith http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtDseXwpJ0U ",0,0,0,1,0

 I'm from LA so I couldn't help but compare with Boiling Point in the 626 when I came here. Pot Tea was good and cheap but I think I like BP better. We arrived a little before 5pm on Saturday (12/27/14) and it was empty! I was scared because I chose this location for my boyfriend's family to try since I love hot pot. They ended up enjoying it so yay! Unlike BP's hour wait, we had no wait here. Perfect. A lot more people arrived after us and the place began to fill up. FOOD: My bf and I had the ($20) Lobster Hot Pot. It was good. The shells were pre-cracked so it was easy to open (I think). He didn't let me open it. We got minced pork rice with it, but I wish all the pots came with noodles already like BP. He can't handle spicy, so they gave me a spicy soup base on the side. Nice! So I adjusted the spiciness in my bowl to my liking. Unless you're really hungry, one pot is good enough to share between two people. They refill your broth if you need it. His parents has the rib-eye hot pot and they seemed to enjoy it. Price is actually a bit cheaper than BP. Popcorn chicken was yummy. Needed a dipping sauce though. SAUCE: The two sauces are a Ponzu sauce and a chili bean paste(?) sauce. They were good but I like BP's side sauces better. TEA: SO GOOD! I'm spoiled by LA's tea shops, but I enjoyed this. I got the lychee black tea and it was delicious. I believe the waitress said their tea were imported from Taiwan(?). BF got mango green tea and it was yummy but I liked my choice better. His dad got a tea latte and it looked really good. Wish I got to try it! SERVICE: Service was wonderful. Since we were first and it was less crowded, service was very attentive and nice. The waiter and waitress were really helpful since it was our first time there. She explained things thoroughly and said we could sub things in our hot pot if we wanted, which is something you can't do at BP! The Filipino waiter said something to me in Tagalog (possibly thank you) because I guess I blended in with my bf's family haha. He was very polite to my bf's parents. Basically, they were great! It was a different experience from LA's Boiling Point; I enjoyed it. Loved the no wait!! Like the other reviewer said, they're both different and they're both good. And don't forget a stamp card if you're a Vegas local! ",0,0,0,1,0

 This was my first Cirque Du Soleil show I've ever been too, and I have to say, ""IT WAS AMAZING!"" The way they incorporate certain angles and transitional scenes make you believe you're actually watching a CGI movie, but it's real life! You can't understand a word the performers are saying, it sounds like SIMS talking back and forth, but you can pretty much understand the story line just by watching which makes this show appropriate for any cultural background. The performers knew what they were doing, and the show was spectacular. They had martial arts, acrobatics, and even a kind of funny circus like quality in a few scenes. The scenes were beautiful : ) I would highly recommend this show especially if you like more Asian cinema then this would be the Cirque Du Soleil for you :D ",0,0,0,1,0

 It is a great location & the place looks nice, but I was extremely underwhelmed. It is a shame. It took time for someone to seat me & serve me. The food was just ok at best.

 Rude and unprofessional!!! Well, I was going to try this establishment. I changed my mind, however! I walked in, and there was no ""wait to be serrated"" or ""seat yourself"" sign,. When I looked around unsure of rather to sit or wait, I was passed by a waitress that thought so highly of herself that she didn't give eye contact, or acknowledge my presence in the slightest. Way to seem inviting to a new customer. I'll take my business elsewhere, and I suggest you do to! ",1,0,0,0,0

 The owner Pauly is rude. I work in an office close by and we received free delivery if over $15.00. I ordered three lunch specials and got grief from him stating they are usually only used for large orders. Well Pauly, don't put max of $15.00 on the delivery and be more specific. He always rubs me the wrong way and comes off very rude. I guess that's the New York type of guy that is RUDE. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the food. I usually get the white stone pizza and salad. The dressing is to die for. Today, my family came by my work to have lunch with me and so I called and preordered it for take out b/c I wasn't sure if we were eating there or not or back at the office. But after I took the order over the phone, my coworkers wanted to order out as well and I was going to pick it up for them. So it ended up being a dine in instead. When we were standing at the front, I looked up at the owner and smiled. He just looked back and didn't crack a smile at all. Just a rude person, I guess. So we got our food and I could hear the owner wasn't happy that I got take out and we ate in. Saying that was a take in NOT a take out. Same day my family dined in, my coworkers had ordered for 11:30 am so I could take it when I leave. Well, the owner asked too, this is for you. I answered yes. When I was walking out the door, I noticed that my coworkers pizza was placed on a paper plate and in a paper bag. Typically, they put the piece in a to go box. I took a pic of it and it's my screen picture. This is ridiculous and RUDE. Pizza and food is good if you can get over the owner that works there. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I came her with some friends to see the band SOJA. this is one of my favorite venues to see a live show anywhere! The inside has multiple levels and there is not a bad place anywhere - standing room only unless you get there early enough to grab one of the few bar tables and stools. The bar is large and can handle many people wanting drinks at one time. You get the feeling that you are on top of the bands when they are playing - a great intimate experience and makes you feel like they are playing at your house. Tip the bartenders well and they remember your drink orders, so by the time I bellied up about the 3rd or 4th time - my drinks were placed in front of me in what seemed like 10 seconds or less! The free self serve water next to the bar is a nice touch too. The bathrooms are large and nicely located. I have been to many shows here - thanks to the Visualite for getting this small place right!

 My friends and I were feeling adventurous so we decided to check out Z Girl Club last Saturday. I was a little nervous upon our arrival because I had been to the club before and if I remembered correctly... it was a dark and scary lesbian bar with ladies leering at you. Wow, to my surprise the place was completely different. I mean, it's still a lesbian bar, but that's about the only similarity. Upon entering the building, I was surprised to see a well lit sitting area with the MLB playoffs on flat screen TVs. The seating area is a waiting area because the bouncers will only let a few people into the dance floor/bar area at a time. So, feeling like fresh meat, we all stood and chatted while we waited to be let into the club. Shots were being served in the waiting area as well as beers, but no mixed drinks...boo. Once we finally were allowed into main area, the music was jumping and so were all the ladies! There were all kinds of women at this club! I was just amazed at the diversity of the crowd and how much fun everyone was having. It wasn't hard to be drawn into the atmosphere. We decided to stay for a drink before heading out to continue our night out. I wouldn't mind coming back to stay a little longer and possibly dance. Z Girl is nothing fancy, but it's not a seedy dive either. Stay for a drink and people watch! You'll be entertained either way! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have always liked the Chart House chain, even though I am not a seafood fan! The Chart House in Las Vegas, at the Golden Nugget is one of my favorites! The 75,000 gallon aquarium is the center piece of this restaurant and there is not a bad seat in the house for viewing it! You can even ask the server for a fish identification chart if you are so inclined to learn what types of fish are swimming around in it. It is absolutely amazing! The food too is great. The shrimp cocktail is firm and fresh, served with a great cocktail sauce. The ""Calamari and Friends"" was delicious! I highly recommend. It was lightly fried and very fresh. The ""friends"" included lightly fried veggies -- carrots, peppers, and sweet potatoes. The Chopped Spinach Salad with warm bacon dressing, chopped egg, bacon, radishes & mushrooms wash beautifully presented and then chopped by our server. The dressing was just enough and not overwhelming like can often be with this type of salad. Since I am not a seafood lover, I got the 12 oz. prime rib and it was melt in your mouth! The baked potato that I ordered as a side was also perfectly done. My partner had the Stuffed Flounder filled with jumbo lump crab drizzled with lemon butter and served with Yukon golden mashed potatoes and asparagus. The stuffing was good but the fish lacked some flavor and was rather bland. The prices are right in line with this type of high end restaurant with main dishes costing between $25 and $40.

 I went in the other day and tried the green tea and plain. Both were rather melty straight out of the machine so it was almost all melted by the time I got in the car. I got a small plain w/ mochi, blueberries and strawberries. At first, I only wanted two toppings, but the worker (presumably the owner) said it costs the same for 3... so, that's kinda annoying to HAVE to pay for 3 toppings ($3.95 I think). Whatever. Some of the toppings (the dry stuff and the browned banana slices) didn't look all that appetizing, but the (other) fresh fruits weren't bad. The mochi was a bit soft for my taste. The worker gave me two cards for a buy one get one free offer so I'll probably be back. I'll give them awhile to (hopefully) improve first though. It's relatively close to my house so I really want them to succeed! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Not too shabby, not sure if worth more stars... 1. Location - Great location in strip mall, easy parking and easy to get to. 2. Ambiance - really nice and relaxing.

Price - Very Reasonable. 5. Food - The hummos had a very nice texture. the babaghanoush was succulant with its wonderful smoke / grilled flavor. All the entrees were okay, and not great and I would have expected more great flavors in all other foods. I ordered the dish with extra steamed vegetables and I got instead an order of frozen type vegetables that was fried or with oil instead of steamed. Check this place out.

 I'm loving this place more and more. After many visits to the bars, countless trips to the buffet, and hard earned money lost; this place simply amazes me.

Stagger your way across casino floor drinking yourself silly from bar to bar. All drinks are $1. Yes, you heard it. ONE FRICKIN' DOLLAR! Too good to pass up.

 I love bebe so I would've thought 2b bebe is pretty similar right? I know it's not the exact same quality since the price ranges between those two stores are night and day. I went in on a WEEKDAY NIGHT. Probably 2 hours prior to store closing. Customer service wasn't very good. I only had one associate greet me the entire time while I was there but I think she only asked if I needed any assistance because I was shopping at the section she was folding clothes at. Their layout of their merchandise isn't all that shopper friendly. Most of their clothes are hung on top bars and bottom bars. I'm a short girl (5ft 1in)....good luck to the other short girls trying to reach for items at the top bars. It just doesn't make a good shopping experience while trying to browse/reach for items up top all while having a bunch of other items on my arms at the same time. I made my way towards the fitting rooms and nobody was there to assist me. Or so I thought. A few moments later, an associate emerged from outta nowhere. Watcha doin hiding in the fitting room girl?!?! I know you had to straighten out the go-backs and such but the go-back racks are located in the front of the fitting room anyways. Accessories rack wasn't very appealing either. Bracelets were just thrown in baskets while earrings and necklaces were hung on racks in a messy way. Necklaces were all tangled. All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way JUST to come to this store. If I'm in the area, fine...I'll stop by. But this is definitely a ""meh. I've experienced better"" kind of store. I was only here because all their tops were 30% off. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Nothing like what you saw on ABDC. Located in the Monte Carlo, the Jabbawockeez theatre has limited seating which is reserved and chosen when you purchase your tickets online or at the box office in the front. For $90/person, I came in with very high expectations. However, for me, there was too much skit and not enough dancing. Actually, the plot didn't make very much sense at all. It seemed like there was a story (which I didn't understand) and some random dancing throughout. Overall, I was highly disappointed and wish they had cooler stunts/choreography like they had on ABDC.

 Let me say up front that my food was great, so the missing two stars have little to do with that. Pacific Ring (did they mean Pacific Rim?) is an attempt to do Japanese and Chinese simultaneously, with some Thai thrown in for good measure. The bad news... Not the worst idea in the world, but as often happens with that strategy, the menu is way way way too long. It worries me when menus are that long at an independently-owned operation like this because the odds that the hundreds of ingredients necessary to cover all the dishes are fresh and at their best every day, are slim to none. As a vegetarian, I'm slightly less concerned since I'm not spending top dollar on what may not be the freshest fish or beef or chicken. But I still care about my carnivorous friends :-) Also, while some of the Japanese salads and noodle dishes seem fine, they're attempting sushi too, which makes little sense. If I want to consume raw fish, I'm going to go somewhere which sole laser-like focus is on the preparation of raw fish. Especially if I'm in an inland city like Pittsburgh. At Pacific Ring, sushi seems completely out of place. Like the menu, the place is just too big. Granted, I ate there on a Tuesday evening during Pittsburgh's worst snowfall in decades. But restaurants are always going to have more slow-going weekday evenings, and it's just not good advertising to be serving diners in a huge, fairly empty restaurant. Better to err on the side of small and pack them in every night, I think. The good news... My ma po tofu was excellent. Without requesting it, my tofu was steamed, not fried. Very little grease in either that or my hot & sour soup. There is likely some MSG here, but I'm sure they'd leave it out if asked. The waitstaff was prompt and friendly. Despite the size of the place, the design is pleasing and the lighting is good. Great location along the Murray strip in Squirrel Hill N. And the prices are, for the most part, very reasonable. I would eat here again, but I'd be weary of meat/seafood items, and I'm not sure that I'd invite anyone but close friends who don't need to be impressed to dine with me. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Hash House is a great restaurant to go to for massive portions and delicious food! We had a group of 6 and couldn't finish all of our food for dinner. It was a shame to see the food wasted. We could have ordered 2 dishes and finished everything. We started off with humongous biscuits. They were the size of my fist! The biscuit was pretty good; it wasn't dry. The honey and butter gave it some better flavor. We also asked if there were any fruit jams available from breakfast. There was strawberry jam in the fridge and it was very fresh tasting. Yum! Everyone practically ordered from the breakfast menu. Who wouldn't want breakfast for dinner? We had the following dishes: + Pacers Hash ($12.95) - The potatoes were crispy and the pork as moist. Fresh corn, green beans, asparagus, scrambled eggs, and fruit also came with the dish. One small gripe was the cheese that covered the dish was a bit too heavy for me. Otherwise, great flavors! + Boston Hash ($14.95) - The crab cake was pretty good, and the horseradish cream was not overpowering. The tomatoes in the hash made the potatoes a little soggy though. Dish came with asparagus, fruit, and scrambled eggs. + Hammered Pork Tenderloin Benedict ($14.95) - Wow! This dish was awesome! The pork was so moist. I couldn't believe the size of the pork. The creamy sauce was yummy too. Also comes with a biscuit at the bottom. + Grilled Portabello Mushroom Sandwich ($12.95) - I didn't get to try the sandwich, but I heard that it wasn't bad. Split charge is $2.50 per person. I would definitely come back again and try breakfast during the morning/lunch time. The food is very fresh since the restaurant doesn't own any freezers. You can also visit the Hash House in San Diego. Our waiter told us that there would be another Hash House on the strip in the near future. Yay!

 I am a huge fan of Vietnamese food, so we decided to look up a place to go on Yelp while we were in Vegas.

I don't understand where all the great reviews came from, but I thought the food here was terrible! The soup was 'warm' at best, the broth was tasteless, the noodles were a mushy lump in the bottom of the bowl, the meat tasted 'off'', and the service was terrible.

 Went here last night with a few people. Even though the place was mostly empty, we had to wait for a booth. When we were seated, it took around 12 minutes for anyone to see us. I know this because I checked in on FourSquare and got a free salsa and chips deal, so I had to keep my phone open to show my server, and I couldn't help but notice the time. When when we could find our servers, which was hard to do, they were polite and helpful even when fixing an ordering problem. The food was OK, nothing special. I did find the idea of corn in the guacamole a little unusual. I had the burger bites which were tasty enough to take home. My companions had ribs and mozzarella sticks. Main complaints? Hard to find the servers, and the floor in the place was DISGUSTING. Napkins and sticky stuff everywhere. Nice things? Free deal on foursquare for salsa and chips, tasty burger sliders. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I appreciate the attention to detail that Osso put into the decorations at the restaurant. It's absolutely beautiful inside. However, the food and service here just didn't do it for me. My friend was visiting from out of town and we stopped here for dinner and drinks. We arrived pretty early and there were plenty of open tables but apparently you need a reservation to get a table...no problem so we just sat at the bar. The drink menu is not extensive but they have a full bar and a decent selection of martinis. I ordered the Bikini Martini. It was good, not great. It's a mix of pineapple, coconut and grenadine...sounds super yummy. But it was not...(that's just my opinion) I finished it but I would not order it again. For the meal, I went with the chicken, spinach and mascarpone ravioli. I ordered the small portion thinking it would be more than enough but I was mistaken. The plate came out with three pieces of ravioli in the parmesan cream sauce sauce. I didn't enjoy it. And I was really underwhelmed with the presentation and after a few bites it was back to Yelp to search for another spot to eat because I was still really hungry. Also the service was lacking. It wasn't that busy but after we ordered there were a few other guest that came in and ordered and got their food before we did...what's up with that?!? As we were wrapping up we felt rushed along...apparently there was an event there later that evening that they were setting up for...So it just seemed like we were in the way. Ugh. All in all, for the price and location I expected better. I'm not sure I'd go back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Excellent! I haven't been to a Red Lobster in literally YEARS!! We had recently ate at a ""high end"" sea food place in town, with an unbalanced product:value ratio. Red Lobster was a refreshing surprise at a fraction of the price. GF had a gift card, so we popped in during Lobster Fest. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING was great!! We were quoted 45 minutes for a table and were seated in 20. Every point of contact was polite, but casual. The biscuits are everything I was promised, the specialty cocktails are delightful, and specials really covered all tastes. I got two, perfectly cocked and wonderfully seasoned lobster tails. GF had the Surf & Turf which she said was great, but wouldn't let me taste, as she was too excited to eat it herself. (j/k, she reads these) If I had to lodge a complaint: The water in the bathroom sink gets hot too fast. We had an very good mean, with great service, for literally 1/3 of what we paid at a fine dining, sea food specific establishment (see next review). ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is just about as good as it gets! I've been going here for a couple years. They have a fantastic variety of pastries, breads & croissants to make you insane and obese all at once. Everything is good... everything! They also serve up big fresh sandwiches that are flat out delicious, yet simple, made on the spot for a very nominal price. Like 5$! I'll often walk by on my way to the park, grab my lunch and watch the weirdos prowl Parc Lafontaine for an hour. Enjoy! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Finally a Paradise Bakery near me! I don't have to drive all the way to Scottsdale for them anymore! No longer will my family be forced to make an adventure across the other side of town to pick up my cookie cake because I hate real cake! Right? Wrong. This Paradise Bakery just plain sucks. I still order my cookie cakes and cookies from here because it's convenient but I would never eat their food. I've tried eating here twice. Once an albacore sandwich that tasted like someone died inside of it (not the fish). The second time was just pasta salad. How do you mess up pasta salad? TELL ME. Another time my cousin ordered tomato soup and she found what we presumed to be part of a plastic spoon inside of it. How does that even happen? Are they intentionally messing with us or did they really just serve us used soup? This location is always packed. I've never come here and not had to wait in line for at least ten minutes. That and the employees (besides ONE old lady who works there) are total jerks. I'm serious. Dude you work at Paradise Bakery for a living. Don't talk down to me when I'm trying to order a cookie. I only come here to get my Mr Pibb fix or to buy my mom cookies. Their cookies are just as good as any other Paradise. I have no idea what happened to their food or who trained their employees.

 Uuuuugggghhhhhh....cheese..and..... eggs............. Eggs and cheese......... Went here on a Friday night because it's talked about a lot by my coworkers, and there is always a line out the door. Got seated quickly somehow --by the time we left, the wait was nearly 45 minutes-- got our water and chips/salsa. Pedestrian chips and salsa and I ate too many as usual waiting. Everything on the menu looked just like a menu at Everyman's Mexican restaurant. I am always drawn to the 'house special' or 'specialties of the house' or 'chef's specials' or 'House specials of the chef'. Somehow I always think of an old Mexican lady in the kitchen fighting back tears of nostalgia from younger days in Olde Meheeko when she sees that someone as brave as me has ordered a family favorite. (No no no Jeffro, it is just not so.) In this case, it was the chile relleno. I'm a big fan of these chiles stuffed with plain cheese then battered and fried. I should have noticed the slight rise in the waitresses eyebrow when I made my choice audible, or the sudden silence as patrons ushered their children close and nefarious men went for their sidearms. Back in the kitchen, the cooks certainly chuckled and shrugged their shoulders in a combination of silky knowing and territorial pissing. This is our Special a la casa, and you will be surprised that you can be liking it!! Soon others will come!!!! What arrived at the table seemed like a mistake. This is not food -it is a sacrifice. A large head-sized, head/brain-looking mound of food. ""What is this?"" I asked the waitress. She told me it is a special way of preparing the chile and that I would find the tasty morsel somewhere near the bottom of the football-sized mound of eggy souffle. I put my fork in expecting a gasping escape of air and a seconds-later reasonable sized dinner. No. If anything, it got larger (that's what she said). I went for it, but like Shackleton at the pole, I was stuck 20 minutes later. With my spouse finishing her enchiladas, I was still less than 1/3 into the meal and forever sworn from chile rellenos. The eggs alone must have skinnied a flock of chickens, the cheese gave Wisconsin a shudder, and the paltry pale anemic chilles resting in the cellar of the mess were no longer in my future as energy and waste product -I had had enough! Giving up and stating so left me feeling free like a recovering alcoholic taking the first step. There is some British research which shows that wild rabbits relax sometimes for the first time in their lives just before death when finally caught by a circling hawk. They no longer live in fear. I no longer live in fear of the TeePee--- I have been caught by the Chile Relleno. Stay hungry my friends, but order a la carte. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I hate to do this because I always try to support small businesses when they are just starting up. But I simply cannot recommend this place. I came in with a friend fairly excited expecting a California burrito with fries and the like, but that wasn't even on the menu. Instead we got bland and not particularly authentic Mexican food. PROS: The beans were the only part of the items I tasted that actually tasted very good to me. The meat all seemed to be very high quality. The shredded chicken was good but a little under-seasoned.The inside was nice enough and the staff was kind. CONS: YELLOW AND WHITE SHREDDED CHEESE MIX that tasted like it was from Walgreens. I'm sorry but for me quality mexican food uses chihuahua cheese, queso fresco, or if they absolutely have to, high quality Monterey jack. The supermarket cheese blend was liberally thrown allover everything in a misguided attempt to plate the food. On the nachos the cheese wasn't even melted. For the flauta, the fillings inside were cold, which was awkward because the tortilla was fried and piping hot. The quesadilla was were the cheese really disappointed me, when I paid nearly $4 for a cheese only quesadilla I expect some good quality melty mexican cheese and lots of it. Instead we received something that would cost a dollar to make in a dorm-room or any place that has a microwave. OK: The guacamole is ok. It's without question very fresh, but I don't think its house-made. The chips were standard. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My friend and I are in Montreal for the weekend and we picked this place because it had good Yelp reviews and we could get a reservation on Opentable. When we arrived, the entire restaurant was completely empty - that should've he been our first clue. Our next clue should've been when the bread arrived...still frozen in the center. We asked our server for new bread, and he abashedly took away the offending bread and brought us a new loaf that was cold, but not frozen. Then, we ordered. I don't eat any pork, so I asked if the guinea fowl dish could be made without any lard, and the server assured me that he could do that. Shortly after, he returned and told me that the guinea fowl is actually baked with lard under the skin, so they couldn't make it totally pork-free. I changed my order to the squash dish - which my friend had also ordered, and added a half-pour of the wine they recommended to accompany the dish. The wine was delicious - and the source of the second star - with the squash dish, and while the squash was tasty, it got boring quickly. The server was not particularly attentive, which was weird since we were literally the only people eating there, and I felt kind of uncomfortable not speaking French. Then, without asking us if we wanted dessert, handed us dessert menus and wandered away for five minutes. I live in a suburb of New York and attend school in Cleveland, so I'm used to New York-quality food at New York prices and Cleveland-quality food at Cleveland-prices, but this was Cleveland-quality food at New York prices.

 The boyfriend and I hit The Greene House on a Friday night and it was a great place for a casual, but not too casual, Friday date. Even though it was Friday we were able to get seated right away. We decided to get a few things to share, that way we could try a couple different items on the menu. We started with the mac and cheese with sausage. It's kind of like an adult version of macaroni and cheese with a hot dog. The mac and cheese is tasty - very thick cheese. The sausage is a link served on the side, cut in half which was perfect since we were sharing. The sausage had a little kick to it but was not super spicy. A nice compliment to the cheese. Next we had the twin Kobe burgers with fries. They put it on two plates so I think we got extra fries which was cool. The burger was delicious. So tender and juicy and had that good burger flavor. They are small like a slider so if we hadn't been getting multiple dishes I could have easily eaten both. The fries were good too, thin and crispy with lighten herbs on them. For desert we had to try the donut. We are both big donut lovers and this one didn't disappoint. It's an oversized sugar donut served with a large donut hole. Definitely big enough to share. On the side is a vanilla and raspberry cream sauce for dipping. It's kind of like a reverse jelly donut. The donut came out warm and soft and was delicious when dipped in the sauce. A great choice for dessert when you want something a little out of the ordinary but nothing too weird. My only complaint about Greene House was the noise. It was very loud in there so it was a little hard to carry on a conversation. The place isn't that big so we were surprised at the noise level. If it hadn't been so hot out we would have sat outside. Oh well, next time. I would love to go back and try some of their other dishes. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Best burger I have ever eaten in my life is the Shogun burger. I think that says a lot for anyone who has eating many burgers in their time living in the USA. This thing was mind blowing. All I have to say is if you have doubts of spending $26 on a burger you will quickly feel like you just got the best deal ever. The Shogun burger consists of Wagyu beef burger topped with foie gras, unagi, poached Asian pears and miso butter. AMAZING! The only negative is we ordered two burgers, the Shogun and the Kiki, and made the mistake and ate the Shogun first. The Kiki was just normal after eating that full flavored Shogun. So if you want to try something else while sharing make sure to try the Shogun last. The pork belly buns and the garlic edamame were also really good. Good eats! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Portofino's is the kind of restaurant I can get behind. A small local chain with great food, equally great staff, and a warm and inviting atmosphere. I've ate there twice and both times were good experiences. Their food is hearty and filling and a notch above anything I could concoct in my kitchen. The chicken portofino has everything Italian food should in my opinion, alot of well seasoned tender meat, rich creamy sauce, and a huge helping with enough for leftovers. The shrimp parmigiana isn't quite as perfect, but I still enjoyed it and like that they use really fresh jumbo shrimp. Kudos for their tomato sauce too, some places have a tendency to make theirs overly sweet, but Portofino's keeps their sauce a little tangy, just as a tomato should taste. I feel that great service can make average food subconsciously taste better, but luckily the quality of their food and service shine through in both areas. Their staff is superbly friendly and they come by frequently to check on things. They clearly want you to have a great meal, and as you can probably tell by my review, I like Portofino's quite alot. Skip the 45 minute waits at Olive Garden and come here, you'll leave with a full belly and a smile on your face. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I experienced the fireworks dinner cruise package on July 26, it was something I booked a couple months in advance for my birthday weekend. I highly recommend any kind of cruise for a special occasion. AML does brunch, dinner, overnights or simple sightseeing cruises and this was a very fun, original idea. The boarding time on my ticket was for 6:45 but I arrived around 5 pm to get a window table since it's first come first serve. Because there was a line forming well before departure, they let us in around 6. AML cruises seem to cater to an older crowd, probably because of the price point, there were mostly middle aged/retired folks on board. We are a couple in our mid twenties and were the youngest people there! The buffet dinner I chose was already ready for us once we got seated, food was as described on the menu, I really liked the sliced beef and veal tortellini- drinks are not included, soda or juice was 3.50$ with no refills and you'd have to tip on top of that. Maybe because we weren't paying for any extras, the service was slow - our server was inattentive to our needs and we constantly had to flag her down for water refills. Our dining room was on the bottom level of the Louis Jolliet ship, loved the huge windows and ambiance lights, everything was decorated nicely. We had some great views and just cruising on the river was a very relaxing/romantic setting. The floor is designed at a slant though so it can be uncomfortable depending on where you are sitting. You are free to leave your table and get some air on the upper decks but there is no guarantee that you will get the same spot when you come back as servers clear the table and re-set it. If you want more action, one of the decks had a dance floor, bar and DJ. I recommend leaving for no more than half hour periods or so and leave an article of clothing or something on the table to signal that it is occupied. Once the fireworks come along, everyone is gathered on the top deck, there are some comfy sofas and seats to lounge on - get there the earlier the better because it does get packed. Tip: when going down the exterior stairs on the ship, best to walk sideways, they are extremely steep and narrow, I ended up scraping the back of my ankles on the gritty sandpaper non-slip strips. Ouch! In all, if you like beautiful settings, a little glitz and glamour of going away on a 4 hour dinner cruise- this is for you. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've been going to Mr Sushi for the past 5 yrs. They are actually open for lunch on Saturdays. They have the best lunch specials and my favorite rolls i order are the Mexican and New York roll. Love their salad dressing and all the different appetizers. The only complaint i have about this place is that sometimes they will have a all you can eat night and of course on those nights the place gets packed. They do not seem to have enough staff to accommodate such a large number of customers on those nights. They need better planning on those nights. We must have waited at least 30 minutes just to order. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Walking into this small restaurant, i could image I was in a nice part of Mexico City. Showing up with my customary crew of three little boys, you can imagine some people would be annoyed, but our hostess greeted us kindly and found us the space to sit down. They didn't mind at all that we had to park the stroller at the small bar. The boys were hungry monsters and we got baskets of chips right away. I found several lovely non spicy salsas for the boys, including a pecan salsa, cilantro salsa, and strawberry salsa. We ordered a mole taco, shark taco, and pibil taco with a side of rice and beans to share among us. It was plenty for two adults, two little ones and a very picky 8 yr old who just ate chips. Each taco was awesome.each was Realy unique in flavors. The beans and rice were both boring and bland. All salsas were delicious. It almost didnt m atter what we ate because it was all so delish. The decor was very appealing, although the walls were pretty dirty. The service was good, the music good and rather loud, which helped to drown out the baby pulverizing chips with his fists. This is not wat I would categorize as a good place to take kids, but even so, they were tolerated, and I am just not going to miss trying a place like this because I have my kids with me. The only drawback for me was that this is a SMALL place, and it was hot and airless inside. I don't know if the air conditioning was broken, but just a room fan would have helped a lot. We were sweating by the end of the meal, and not from the pico de gallo. I hope they get that worked out before summer melts the asphalt. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This review is for their lunch sitting... Wow....that one word sums up this place for lunch. If you would have told me that I would be able to have a sitdown two-course lunch for $12.95 in Uptown, I would have told you you were crazy. This place proved me wrong. Considering my burrito, chips, and drink combo from Qudoba or salsaritas pushes $10, Luce was a real breath of fresh air. A fantastic variety of primi and secondi options, as well as daily specials, and you will be able to return to this same restaurant and never get bored. The great menu options, along with militarily efficient service, makes this the go-to spot for folks who work in the uptown area and have a limited time for lunch. I recommend the authentic ceasar with anchovies and fresh shaved parmesan. They had a tomato and goat cheese soup as a daily special that was out of this world as well. The Mare pasta was amazing....tons of fresh seafood throughout this dish. Most places would serve the pasta itself at $12.95. Instead, I got fresh bread with a white bean and olive oil aperitif, ceasar salad, and seafood pasta for my money. Can't beat it! ",0,0,0,0,1

Always very pleasant people here in great moods because the food is incredible. I don't know what they put in their sauce but there must be some sort of crack in it because it's super addicting.

 Heard many good things about this place and went last night for the first time for a dinner I organized with 6 friends. It will probably be my last time there. The interior is oddly laid out and somewhat cold, and we were seated at a table between the front door and the bathroom, about 5 feet from each. Our waiter took our dinner order without writing any of it down. He immediately repeated the order back to us, getting it wrong. Then he reappeared 10 minutes later to confirm our orders once again. Dude, write them down already! The portions were tasty but very small for the price, and it would have been nice to have more than one tiny piece of dry bread. Perhaps, even the option of butter? But the service was my greatest complaint. Even though the restaurant was only half full, people were wandering around like zombies looking for their waiters who had disappeared completely. Our waiter kept interrupting our table's single conversation without making any effort to be graceful about it....yes, there is a right way to do it without seeming obtrusive. And the men's room desperately needed some cleaning and attention. Wanted to like PastaBAR very much, but probably won't waste any more time on it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 If you're looking for great service and polite waiters, this isn't the place for you. The point of this restaurant is to be rude in a sarcastic way. I personally loved this place because it was a great experience and I've been waiting to go here for a while. Our waiter wasn't as rude as I thought, but he looked intimidating. He was actually a very nice guy when it came to our food and me asking questions. I guess some people just can't keep themselves in character, but that's okay. After all the rudeness, it's nice to see a nice side. Our waiter made my boyfriend up a hat with something written on it that I've forgotten and for me? He blew up a balloon and shaped it into a dick, LOL!! The food here isn't bad. It was decent and I'd definitely come back. The price for my group of four cost $100 bucks. Roughly about $25 per person, but I can't argue, It's Vegas. Minus one star because he mentioned that my tip wasn't even 10%. For your information, tip isn't part of the meal. It's me being generous enough to even leave extra money for YOU. Even though I'm sure the waiter gets paid a decent amount, there was only four of us. Tip is added with a group of six or more people. Maybe he was being rude since he gets paid to do so, or he was being serious. Whatever it was, it made me a little irritated. ",0,0,0,1,0

 For the price, I expected more. The ambiance was not as impressive as I thought a roof top restaurant would be. The hostess was unattentive and the staff did not treat us as valued guests. Not to say the service was bad, but that there was nothing to write home about. After telling the waitress that we were celebrating our anniversary, we never once received as much as a congratulations from her. We had to wait ten plus minutes to even be acknowledged, and then we had to repeatedly ask for our water to be refilled. The food was delicious, we had the chorizo stuffed dates and kimchi rice for appetizers. For our main course, we had the lobster tail with corn, fingerling potato hash, brussel sprouts and bourbon glaze, and vegetable chow main. My girlfriend is a vegan, while we did not expect to be blown away by vast vegan options, there wasn't so much to select from. The waitress was not knowledgable with the menu, and was not able to recommend many options for us. Overall, this was a decent yet far over-priced experience. ",0,0,1,0,0

 My sweetie has wanted to see the show for quite awhile so we made online reservations before our trip to Vegas, The show itself is a little cheesy, but quite a lot of fun.

We asked ahead of time for the fruit plate rather than the apple turnover thing and I am glad that we did! It was delicious. The service was banquet style, so not a lot of interaction.

 ""Hey, Kerstin! Why are you eating a grilled cheese for dinner? Didn't you just eat out?"" ""Yeah, but we ate at Miracle Mile."" 'Nuf said, really, but our experience was such an epic fail, I must elaborate a bit. This was Hubby's suggestion, mind you, and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options. After a lunch of Peter Piper, however, even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him. We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later, since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue. He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish. This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust. What he got was an overly peppered dried out, square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste, crunch, or flake to it. It had that speckled look that old pastry gets. If this is what a knish is supposed to be, then they nailed it. I got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread. What is this? 1950? At least it wasn't Wonder Bread. It was wheat. I had asked for sour dough, when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially. There were. The manager ""saved"" me by correcting his employee about the caraway, only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register. ""Why don't you like caraway?"" she asked. I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied, ""I really don't like the taste."" When she asked me ""Why?"" a second time, you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting this establishment. Anyway, the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the ""sauce"" was totally canned, and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese. It was also not to temp. The mashed potatoes were 75% instant with some red skins thrown in for that ""real"" texture. Foul, foul, foul. Hence, the grilled cheese. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Horrible. I am a strict vegan. I ordered a latte with soy milk at the drive trying thru and drove off. Halfway to work & 6 sips in I realized something tastes off. I opened the cup to discover whipped cream at the top of my cup. I am enraged! Obviously if someone orders soy they are either vegan or lactose intolerant so adding whipped cream defeats the purpose & makes no sense. I called to complain & the manager offered to make me a new drink (too late, I was already at work for my 7am shift) or I could come back later for a free coffee voucher. No thanks, I dont want your mediocre coffee. Do yourself a favor and drive down the street to Sunrise Coffee on Sunset, east of Eastern.

 Not Rustic one bit but sort of Basement Chic. Family owned featuring The Home Cook preparation Style of breakfast, lunch and dinners in a wide assortment of diner priced meals.

I decided on a Spicy Chicken Wrap and got to pick one of 12 sides I picked Grilled Vegetables. Well it wasn't too salty or oily and the chicken seemed fresh and being an overly generous portion that could feed two ladies I think I should give 3 stars but, My Spicy Chicken Wrap was NOT SPICY one bit and when I took a bite out of it a big slice of tomato plopped out and the 1/2 wrap I was holding started squirting out liquid all over the plate like it was peeing.

 After three months back in Charlotte, husband and I finally hit up Ru San's this weekend. We'd heard some good things, mostly from the vegetarian blogs and yelpers, and we weren't disappointed. It was about 8:00 on a Friday night, and the place was hopping - luckily, though, the patio was half empty so we got a table quickly enough. I have to say I was relieved; although the idea of ""diner sushi"" (as my husband called the inside atmosphere) seems cool, the inside was louder and less subdued than I prefer. Sitting outside, at least we could hear ourselves think. Our server was adorable, a young Asian American guy with a super emo haircut and an impish grin. The sushi could have been shit, and I think I would have still enjoyed myself because of him. Happily, however, the sushi was pretty decent, mostly because of the large list of vegetarian maki. We ordered five rolls - the spinach, pickled radish, tempura tofu, sweet tofu, and dried cranberry - and they were all tasty. Husband preferred the tempura tofu, and I thought the sweet tofu was the best. We also ordered an appetizer of their veggie dumplings, which were served with a spicy garlicky dipping sauce that was out of this world. Husband had a beer, and I had wine, and the tab still ran under $40. For a nice night on a patio with some totally edible sushi, I'll take it. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Yummy in my tummy goes the won-ton soup. It is my go to for when anyone is feeling sick and totally hits the spot with all its veggies. Best in the valley, IMHO. The fried rice is also really yummy here. They don't skimp on the veggies which I love. Last visit to eat in was a couple weeks ago and the waitress/owner(?) was super nice to us and our French friends visiting from across the pond. I will definitely make an effort to eat in more often instead of ordering out. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Not bad food and I like the atmosphere of eating in the middle of the Forum Shops. A little expensive for what you get (but I suppose that's an apt description of a lot of Las Vegas restaurants). Our waiter was good, and even pointed out that a dish I initially ordered wasn't their best. It seemed a little odd at the time to have a waiter bad-mouth a dish, but I appreciated the honesty and ordered something else. While there are many other places to go in Vegas that I would recommend this was a good choice since we didn't have reservations anywhere else that night. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We are quilters from outside of the Carolinas, and we decided to try this shop based on the pictures on their web site. While it isn't a huge place, they have a well-organized store, making it easy to find fabrics, rulers, and notions. Given that it wasn't busy, the staff member was willing to cut fat quarters for us if we couldn't find any of the fabric we wanted. She also pointed out that they had pre-cut full repeats of larger patterned fabric. Projects from classes were displayed around the store, making me wish I could come back for one. Best of all, they had a scrap bin: stuff a quart Ziploc bag for $3 (bag must close). Excellent for someone looking for appliqu \ u00e9 items or for small paper-piecing material. If we return to Charlotte, we will definitely return to this store. One more thing: They use an ID code for every fabric, and your receipt will list the numbers. This means if you want to order more of a given fabric, you only need to tell them the ID number. This is very handy! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I ordered the Land of Enchantment plate deciding that the pecan grill might satisfy my cravings for a properly grilled steak. I was very happy with the proteins, the prawns and steak were both cooked very well, and were both seasoned expertly. My only real issue with the meal was that the potatoes were ice cold and that the vegetables seemed very out of place, almost tossed haphazardly on the plate to complete the dish. My plate also felt very cold, so I imagine the timings just weren't right in the kitchen. The service was excellent though, and the atmosphere of the place was great. ",0,0,0,1,0

 On our way home to LA, we stopped by this store at 4:55 p.m. to pick up some foie gras. When we arrived, the store was dark and looked like it had been closed for quite some time despite its posted sign that they don't close until 5:00 p.m. We were so disappointed that the store would close so much earlier than it advertised and caused us to drive there for nothing.

 This guy is no joke! He gets the job done while putting a smile on your face. His videographer counterpart and him made our wedding day stress free and his overall attitude made for a memorable event. His overall professionalism is superb and if I ever need pictures or videos of any kind in the future, he's our guy without a doubt! The pictures he took that day were magical like he really captured picture perfect moments that I truly believe is his special touch that I kept reading about in his reviews. He is the best especially if you are on a budget but want quality results as well. Our wedding went better than I could have ever dreamed and the finish product was masterfully retouched capturing the beauty in every moment caught on film. He was definitely one of the best decisions I made for our wedding! ",0,0,0,0,1

 We visited this place today for lunch. Overall, we were impressed with the quality of the food. My burger was perfectly cooked and the pot roast fries were quite yummy. We had the short ribs appetizer and that was really, really good. My husband had the prime rib sandwich and the truffle gorgonzola fries. He really liked it.

 Had some crepes, berry filled and the banana version. It was just ok. I can understand everyone wanting to give 5 stars because the ambience is great, but those two crepes and two cups of joe was over $30.00, but they won't get 5 stars from me. It is what it is and what it was was a mediocre crepe. I shall try more in December for my end of year trip. To be fair, I only tried a small sample of whats available. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We found a 20% off voucher in our room at the Palazzo so we decided to try this place out. They have outdoor as well as indoor seating. I would have sat outside if the weather permitted, but it was just way too hot. The first thing I noticed was the ratio of employees vs patrons. There were definitely more servers and busboys than people eating so we had very attentive service. I started out with Kumamoto oysters on the half shell and my entr \ u00e9e was Linguini Clam. The oysters were ok... not super fresh, but still good. The clam in my linguini were definitely not fresh though...It was pretty bland too... nothing to write home about. I tried some of the duck rillette. It was flavorful, but I just don't really enjoy items like that... It was very convenient if you are staying at Palazzo, but I doubt I would come back since there are so many other options on the strip in Vegas. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It is very difficult for me to admit that a steakhouse is bad, but this one wins. We stayed for 2 hours and they only served 2 types of meat (90% of the time the same one). First of all GAS grill is an assassin of the ""brazilian barbecue"", that's why all tasted really bad. No papaya cream for desert is another indicator that this is not from Brazil . And to close , no espresso, definitely not from Brazil. You got the second start only because of the potato salad and the farofa which were very good. This is so brazilian as Panda Express is chinese. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Wow, this place has quite a few bad reviews! I've been to this location a few times and I have always been pleased with the outcome. They provide a discount to ASU students, so that's always a plus! Also, I have a truck, but they charge me for a standard size car. The first time I went, I was a little confused about all the packages, but the owner explained each of them to me and suggested which package was best for me based on what I told him I wanted done. I thought this was great customer service. My most recent visit, I purchased one of their frequent wash cards, which provides 10 washes and 2 waxes. It is a really big savings for those who cannot stand to have a dirty car. I have recommended this place to a couple friends, who have also had good experiences. I'd much rather support this Mom & Pop car wash over Danny's! ",0,0,0,1,0

 The Cathedral of Learning is perfect. Maybe I am a little biased because I went to Pitt for my undergraduate degree, am currently enrolled as a graduate student for Pitt as well and have lived in Pittsburgh all of my life... But regardless, I love it. The building is gorgeous and is often referred to as Hogwarts- for Pitt students anyway :). The nationality rooms are awesome and so unique! I love taking a look in them and checking out the art and all of the work in general, that has been put into them! There's a secret attic in the American room and I was lucky enough to explore it when I was taking one of my classes as an undergrad. The Cathedral is perfect to study in. Tons of spaces with quiet areas as well as areas for groups to meet. The view from the top is incredible as well! The Cathedral of Learning is a Pittsburgh landmark and is the heart and soul of The University of Pittsburgh. ",0,0,0,0,1

 District One is amazing! I've been twice and about 2 months between visits. I was greeted with a ""Welcome back!"" He said the whole restaurant remembered me because of all silliness my friends and I were having and the jokes I was making. My friends and I were calling it PhOlympics and Phoci. We're full of punny! This unusually cool weather in late May and crazy allergies, Pho is what the doctor ordered. On this visit we ordered Spring Rolls, the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio, and a bowl of the Beef & Flank Pho. I also ordered a Vietnamese Iced Coffee (which is a poor decision on a Wednesday night at 7 PM, I was so jacked) because when in Rome... First out was the Beef Carpaccio, which was a little too salty for my taste, but it was tasty nonetheless. A huge portion and I had a lot of fun eating it with chopsticks. It was peanut, garlicky, citrusy goodness, just tone down the salt! Next up was the Spring Rolls. These were nothing special and were straight to the point. Tasted fresh and the peanut-fish sauce was delicious and fresh. Next up was the Beef & Flank Pho which was delicious. The broth is perfection, top it with some sprouts, jalape \ u00f1os, a squeeze of lime, and sprig of mint. I also add a bit of Sriracha because I like the hot, hot, heat! Seriously, savor the rich complexity of the broth. At this point we were stuffed and happily fed. We were thanked for dining there and happily on our way. District One has a lot of seating, booths and long tables. There's a bar and TVs everywhere. Service is prompt and friendly. Food is fresh and tasty. They also have a bunch of fresh seafood that's delivered daily as well as a Lobster Pho that will happen at the next PhOlympics. Solid Asian Fusion. Definitely a fan! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Yes, I know Whole Foods is evil and any real, self respecting hippie wouldn't be caught dead shopping here. Luckily, I am only about 3/8 hippie. Back in Portland I wouldn't shop at WF very often because there are better stores. But in Chandler there just isn't anything that compares. I love the selection, the focus on local products, the produce is always beautiful, and the bulk section is pretty decent. They have a huge beer selection, and a pretty good wine selection as well. I even did some price comparisons, and I was surprised to find that WF is actually cheaper than Sprouts on many items. The only thing I won't buy here regularly is meat, because the prices are pretty high. However, if you are looking for a hard to find cut, you might have better luck here than other stores. One way they could greatly improve is if they offered a bulk spice section. You really can't call yourself a natural grocery store and not have bulk spices. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Service: standard japanese place. Portion: small Quality: cheap fish Taste: too fishy I'm surprise that many sushi restaurants are trying to make profit by cutting corner. Making a good sushi is not all that too difficult. every sushi restaurant are using the same ingridients. Rice, fish and condiments. (Including the rice vinegar, soy sauce, mayo, etc) bottom line is, that there is no secret on making good sushi. its not like trying to cooking french food or some bbq with secret recipes. the bad about this place. The Rice is not properly marinated, The seaweed was very chewy and they are not using fresh fish - or at least, get a good ones. I know its the desert but you can still get a good fish. the food from kitchen is actually not bad (tempura, tonkatsu, udon) overall, if you are looking for good sushi, this isn't the place.

 I've been to tasty station serval times. The food is tasty and they have good lunch prices. The one thing I will note is that it takes way too long to get your food!

I do not understand why it takes them so long they are not even busy. One time it took them 30min and we were the only ones in the place? Today we had to leave because they had two other tables and after 45 min they had not even begun cooking our food ( they only had two other table sof 3-5 people)?

 We stopped into Su Vino using a Groupon which was a super deal- tasting flight of 5 wines for two people + 1 appetizer at 15$. The appetizer alone cost about this much. The location is really nice, set back off the main area a bit- they have outdoor seating as well as indoor and bar seats. We sat at the bar and got great service. The two men on staff were very friendly and we had a good chat with them while doing our tasting. The wines tend to be on the sweeter side and they have some selections that are not what I'd choose to purchase myself, but it's fun to try them on the flight. Their Un-Oaked Chardonnay ($6 glass/$16 bottle) is crisp and clean, which I liked. We also tried the Razle Dazzle (sparkling wine $5 glass/$18 bottle) since we heard good things about it. I wouldn't order it at any point during a meal, but I would happily grab a bottle or two to drink with friends poolside- this stuff is sweet (but not sickly) and goes down easily. They have two 'Summer Refreshment Selections' which are very sweet and fruity (as you can perhaps tell by their names; Summer Rain and Blue Breeze). We tried the Summer Rain ($5glass/$11.75 bottle)- nothing wrong with a Riesling..has apple flavors which is nice. By far the best wines were the reds though. Their new release, Super Tuscan ($8.5 glass/$28.99 bottle) is very good, in my opinion. From what I remember it's a blend of Cab and ...ok I don't remember. It's nice though. The Bella Rossa ($8 glass/$24.5 bottle) was my husband's favorite. It has notes of chocolate and cherries. I'm not a big fan of Port, but their Porto Cocoa ($8 glass/$24.99 bottle) was pretty interesting and well worth a try. Usually these things are sickly syrupy sweet, yet this somehow managed to not hit that mark, which is good. It was our anniversary, so they gave us truffles (thank you!) to pair with our Port. Great way to finish the tasting. A note on the food- it is yum, but they do have everything prepackaged ready to go- they are not actually going to be cooking anything, more like assembling it on a plate. For me, this was fine for the Antipasto platter (which was the perfect size for two people). As added bonuses- they have a massive games table- you could buy a bottle and hang out for the afternoon which might be fun. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I went here because we had a coupon for bogo buffet. We paid $20 even for two people. Pretty cheap for Vegas! OK, so we walk in and notice that it is a really pretty buffet. Decorated nicely, classy. But the food itself was really lacking. There was hardly anything vegetarian friendly, and very few options in general. One of the smallest buffets I have ever seen. I had whipped potatoes (generic), sauteed mushrooms (decent), and a piece of pizza (good but not worthy of $10), and a few random dessert cakes, as well as half a bowl of broccoli soup (meh). My boyfriend ate much more than me so it wasn't totally a bust, but for me, I still left with something to be desired. For a buffet they spent so much creating, they could really focus on the food. The two stars comes for the sweet but busy waitress. She gave us 3 refills and apologized for taking so long between refill 2-3. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and I wouldn't go back.

 I had an absolute great time at Furio! I just moved to Phoenix from Michigan and had been working for 4 weeks straight before leaving the 2 streets I know that take me to work. When I found out that my mom and grandma were visiting for a week I wanted to show them more than the usual strip malls I have grown to love. I did some research and found out that on Mondays they have an awesome special: Martinis & a Manicure for only $10!!!!!! I thought this would be a perfect activity for a girls night. Needless to say, I was RIGHT! I made a reservation on line a few days ahead just to be sure that we would have a table. The very next day a girl called to confirm and we were all set for the evening. Finding the place was not a problem and when we got there I was pleasantly surprised that we got a spot right in the front row. The martini menu was cute and ideal for a ladies night. We each tried a different one and sampled each other. Once our martinis were served it was time for the manicure. The people at Furio really nailed the ladies night idea with this winning combo. I will be taking many of my girlfriends here in the future! ",0,0,0,0,1

 A small store with a very grand vision. Like another Yelper said, when you walk into Les \ u00c9toffes you really sense that you are entering the store's world. The colors (black, rust, navy, cream), the layout, and the clothes themselves all go together. The feeling is warm and inviting, so you want to go explore all the pieces on display. I used to sell yarn and fabric, so I loved the different textures and materials on display, from a luxuriously dense knit sweater to an elegant silk blouse. The design of each item was trendy but approachable -- I am a jeans and t-shirt kinda lady but I saw things I would wear. So why didn't I come home with a whole new wardrobe? Price, of course, sigh. Les \ u00c9toffes is definitely a special-occasion boutique, and alas I was only sightseeing. While I was there, though, a young man was trying on shirts and mentioned that he was making his first L.E. purchase. It seemed like he'd been looking forward to that day for a while. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Have I finally taken my fill of flashing lights, tasseled pasties, chiming slots and waiting in lines for Vegas clubs on the strip? Not yet. But Body English clamped a lid on my Vegas spirit (or killed my buzz) my first night on my trip. Thank god for Jet on Saturday! So, first a full disclosure. I'm giving Body English 2.5 neutral stars because I did not go inside. I have been to Vegas numerous, multiple, did I mention many? times and know the routine - it's always risky to go to clubs without an ""In."" I understand the drunken f***s that bouncers are up against. But BE sucked ass. Me and two of my friends (all guys) joined the pack outside BE around 11:30pm. The lack of any line structure led to pushing from behind by impatient clubbers, and pushing from the front by inflated dimwit bouncers. A cabby later told me that the Hard Rock Casino didn't double-down on clubbing when it was built and had to retrofit space later, causing lines to spill out into the casino. Since when did a Casino do something on the cheap? Women could get in pretty easily but dudes were screwed. I was reminded of agonizing times outside clubs in Miami soliciting pity from random women - offering to ""please let us pay your cover and buy you and all your friends drinks for the night so we can get in!"" I'm not arguing against having a good ratio of women to guys, but give me a little false sense of hope please! Obviously the bouncers were holding out until midnight when free entrance passes would expire. Other friends found some women yet still had to bribe the Fabio wannabe bouncer $200 on top of paying $30 cover each. We capped our bribe at $80 but gave up -- BE smelled thick of inflated demand by keeping a crowd outside. This club didn't feel worth its fake hype. We felt good about bailing despite having wasted an hour and a half of our precious drinking/dancing/gambling/sinful time. I don't mind waiting, I don't mind the hustle, but I do mind the lack of respect, and the lack of lines or sense of what it takes to get in. (0 * stars) ",0,1,0,0,0

 from 2011 -- Rancho Pinot never fails to deliver. The ambiance is classy, yet comfy. The service -- knowledgeable but friendly. and the food? well, it speaks for itself. whether starting with goat cheese stuffed squash blossoms topped with cherry tomatoes and arugula, or eating the lamb with lemon and beans, the food is fresh, inventive and wholly satisfying. this past weekend we sat at the bar and have skilled mixologist Travis make us a prickly pear manhattan. stellar! after the above-mentioned squash blossoms, we both had the nightly special -- a frisee and spinach salad, tossed in a sherry vinaigrette, with arizona lobster mushrooms, duck confit, crispy matchstick potatoes and a fried egg from Chef Chrysa Robertson's own chickens. topped off the meal with a new dessert -- a roasted banana/rum milkshake accompanied by two homemade peanut butter/chocolate chip cookies. heavenly! rancho is a well-established restaurant in phoenix, with a mostly well-established crowd. however, younger foodies from all over the valley shouldn't keep from flocking here for the fresh, seasonal, expertly crafted food. wine list is great, cocktails are inventive and service is exactly what you would expect for an establishment of this quality.

 Had an office lunch here last week and boy was I impressed. The first thing I always look at - even when I am not drinking - is the cocktail list. If a place cares about their cocktails, then they must care about their food. This is, I think, the first place in Scottsdale I have seen a cocktail (actually several) listing Absinthe on its list. Boom - I am impressed. Plus all these beauties are actually included in the happy hour deal - not like some places where you get the crappy Sky vodka or Absolute cosmo for 5 bucks but the better drinks are still 12. Anyway - love them for that. The place is super cool, I love NYC and the huge art on the wall showing central park definitely got me in the mood. The bathroom even smelled like the tropics - I felt wierd coming back t the table and saying to my work mate - ""oh my god, you have to go to the bathroom - it smells so good in there!"" ha ha!! I had the blackened salmon salad - forget the menu name. A touch over cooked, more on the side of full medium as opposed to medium rare, but the salad dressing (passion fruit) was lovely. The beet chips are amazing for sure. I definitely want to go back for happy hour and try that black truffle hummus and a fun cocktail! So far my favorite place tof all the new joints in the Quarter.

 Stopped by for happy hour. Odd, because it took the better of an unhappy hour to be waited on. Bartender, nice guy, kept telling me he was jammed, but the whole place was less than 1/4 full. Finally got to order (Happy hour specials, apps and since drinks $5. I orderef 1/2 order of naked wings and a glass of the house cab). Took forever to arrive. Wings nice and crispy, but when they say naked, they mean it. No salt, no pepper, almost no flavor. House wine wasn't something I'd order ever again. Not that I'm coming back here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Went to lunch here today at noon. Entered from Scottsdale Mall (Park) side and it was very confusing. On a perfect day all of the sliding glass doors were closed and for a moment we thought it, Distrito was closed. After prying one of the doors open we were greeting to an empty restaurant with exception of one staff member who greeted us but asked if we were ""just passing through""??? (To be fair, the doors were all opened by the time we left and WHAT a difference this makes) After bellying up to bar, our drinks were taken and we were off to a good start. Questions were answered on menu, drinks taken etc... Strangely enough they had an ANT problem where we were sitting and had to kill off several. The friendly enough waiter helped. (Strange for a luxurious restaurant/hotel should have this problem). Chips were delivered right away and several minutes later, the salsa and guacamole we ordered. We had to ask to silverware and napkin set up. Again, strange that such a perceived top notch hotel/restaurant would not be up on this standard, given the place was empty, thought they could/would focus soley on us. FOOD however was TOP NOTCH. Had Pork & Shrimp/chorizo tacos..... Very good quality ingredients and very flavorful. You could tell they hand crafted each one, right down to the tortilla. Would go back for sure but maybe at night. Felt odd being only two in restaurant. Attention to some very basic details could put this in the 5 star category. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Horrible experiences with the staff keeps me from rating this store any better. They carry what you would expect any auto store to have. The staff, however, needs a reality check. Anyone with basic vehicle knowledge can be hired at Auto Zone. Two of their employees, a clerk and a manager, seems to think that they know better than an actual trained mechanic who owns his own shop with an awesome reputation. My mechanic even called to explain to the manager that they sold a faulty merchandise but the manager blatantly refused to speak with him. She went on to explain to my boyfriend and I how their $100 dollar system is very accurate and that our mechanic is wrong. She even tried to have us seek a second opinion. In the end, she ended up honoring their warranty with an extremely arrogant attitude. As anyone can guess, our mechanic was correct and the problem was fixed. The staff here seems to have forgotten how to be courteous to customers. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I go for the garden area, so that means I enter and exit the garden area. Now what I don't understand is their garden gates don't open until 8 a m, regardless of the season. In the Spring and Summer months the seasonal annuals and perennials out front are frequently dry, wilted or dying. Isn't there some sort of job requirement like the most basic garden experience required? Dried up, over watered plants, plants that have been grown in a greenhouse or a climate unlike ours are put in direct sun and fried to a crisp. And these people are supposed to be a source of information when I have questions about a plant or planting something?! Can you tell me why the overhead watering system is turned on when entry gates are opened. Especially when the gates don't open until 8? That folks is how most Home Depot garden centers seem to operate. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I can't believe this worked! I'm thrilled at how well! We were in Vegas over Memorial Day weekend to get married and had about a dozen guests. I wanted to arrange a fun night out, but keep it affordable. I signed up for Moon at the Palms for the Saturday night with a follow up at a strip club. I got an email right away explaining that women would get into Moon for free and men would have a reduced cover charge. A limo would pick us up and take us to the strip club. I was advised that I would hear from Chris via text on the day of to finalize plans and that if there were any last minute changes due to the holiday weekend, I would be notified. So far, so good. Easy...or too easy? I was a little nervous, especially since twelve people were depending on this for a fun time. Saturday afternoon, I was still apprehensive, so I sent Chris a text to confirm. Also, I wanted to change the strip club to another that had been on the list. He replied immediately and stated that 1) Palms was all set and not only would the women get in for free, but so would the men, and the first 150 women get two free drinks. Score! 2) The change in strip club was all set (how this arranged so quickly, I still don't know!) and I would just need to let him know when and where I wanted the limo to pick us up. For real? This was really easy! Sure enough, we arrived at Moon nice and early (as advised because of the holiday and also to make sure we got our free drinks) - so early, in fact, that Moon wasn't open yet! No problem, though; we were shown to the View lounge and enjoyed cocktails and the view before heading upstairs to Moon. At 11:00 PM, I got a call from the limo driver telling me that he would be outside the Palms at 11:30 as I had requested. Sure enough, he was there on time and took us all over to the strip club I wanted. We tipped generously, of course. I still cannot wrap my brain around how organized and professional Chris and his system work, but I am a total believer! I would recommend this service to anyone looking for a fun and affordable way to enjoy the Vegas nightlife. I look forward to working with Chris again whenever I'm in Vegas! ",0,0,0,0,1

 While visiting friends in town, we decided to get a pick-me-up in hot liquid form downtown. We ended up at Kopi because it was Dad's Weekend for the University, and our first choice was packed, with no table space.I totally wish that I could have tried the other shop, because I was pretty much disappointed with this one. I guess it was doomed from the start, when I was given the wrong drink. I ordered a Mate Latte, and was called over to pick up my drink, and it was a regular latte. Now, I am normally the person who would say something, but it was cold and drizzly, the place was busy with lots of people trying to get to and around the counter, and I was cranky. Whatever. I also wasn't too impressed with the Snicker-doodles that we ordered. Not bad, but not great either. The place itself has your basic non-chain cafe vibe, but it's so overcrowded with tables that it's hard to maneuver through. I guess I'd try this place once more, just to be fair. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I would give this buffet a 4.5 rating. Wynn's buffet is definitely one of the best ones I've been to in Las Vegas. I went for lunch, but was able to stay past 330 when they started bringing out dinner food (hahaha). For lunch they served huge jumbo shrimp, ceviche (even the shrimp in the ceviche was big), cali rolls, prime rib, asian food, etc. For dinner they started bringing out the big daddy king crab legs, and lamb chops. the lamb was smokin delicious. In total, my friends stayed there from 1:30pm to around 4pm. The service was excellent as well. Highly recommend it if you're ready to stuff your face in some good food. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Well you shouldn't really expect too much from airport Chinese food, honestly. It will be expensive, it will be filled with grease, and you have to be really careful with picking what to eat because most of the food available will not taste good. I got fried rice, mixed vegetables and green beans. The fried rice was bland, the veggies were edible, but I thought that the green beans tasted quite decent. Granted I love green beans, it's really hard to mess them up, and I hadn't eaten anything for over 10 hours and I was starving. Ended up paying a little over $8 for all of this. I didn't think it was too too bad as I didn't have high expectations in the first place, but I wish I had read the yelp reviews beforehand; I'd have gone too BK or chilli's. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Best chips and salsa in town! However, there's something funny with the guac (I love table side prepped guac and this was NOT that). It came prepped and strangely sweet. Weird. My son (a toddler) chose an uncrustable for lunch (I know, how lame), I was thrilled it was an option honestly. However, they microwaved it!! No No No! It specifically states DO NOT microwave on the box - My son got a soupy (and hot-pocket-esque) mess. Was soupy and gross. Things just seems to be more around cost cutting and not as ""fresh"" as you'd want a mexican place to be. My husband really liked his carne asana tacos... But we won't be back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 You have to completely and utterly tanked to enjoy Toppers. Period. There is no other reason any reasonable person would ever want to put this shit into their body. This is the result of Ronald McDonald and the Noid conceiving a demon baby in a pit of flaming grease. I have personally witnessed the reinforced cardboard pizza box fall apart under the pressure of that seeping acid they call oil. You will have burning diarrhea for days. There is good cheese everywhere in Wisconsin; the pudding-like goop they put on top of their pizza is not an excuse to do this to yourself. Combine this with the fact that they have the most arrogant, inattentive customer service in the history of restaurants, and it makes for the shittiest dining experience possible. It takes no less than an hour to get a pizza from here, but it leans more towards 2-3 hours when it's late and the drunk idiots with no taste barrage the place with orders. I am pretty sure that eating at Toppers is forbidden in the Old Testament. For the sake of yourself, everyone in smelling distance of you, and the children with birth defects you may father/mother if you continue to eat here, just put down the phone. Upped to 2 stars because I enjoyed it in a drunken, shameful moment of weakness. May or may not have cried afterwards. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I came here a few years back since I had never gone to a Brazilian steakhouse. The short of it is that the food is decent, but the service is terrible. My friends and I visited as part of ""Restaurant Week."" They have many servers who bring meat and slice it onto your plate, and you have the option to try many of their side dishes while you wait. Their garlic mashed potatoes were delicious, but I don't remember anything else that stood out much, so I can only remember it not being stellar. The meat was okay... if you can get it. The food quality is probably akin to a mid-level steakhouse. The service is another story. I can understand that they are extremely busy with serving all the people there, and that they can only bring specific meats every so often, but we were often left with nothing on our plates. When they did come around with the skewers, it was usually something that was not particular popular that night and hence something we were not particularly interested in. Most of the time we would still eat it, mostly because we were too hungry to wait for the favorites such as the tenderloin and flank steak. The frustrating part was not just that we did not get any food, but they often just flat out walked past us instead. We had the unfortunate luck of being seated next to three young pretty girls, so when the waiter even came within the vicinity of our table, they ignored us and walked to the table next to us instead. I told my friends they needed to wear lower-cut shirts, so my advice to you would be to go with an excess of gorgeous girls if you want to eat any meat. After spending two hours sitting around, most of us were still somewhat hungry. Finally, around 30 minutes before they were about to close and with the restaurant clearing out, they finally realized we were sitting there waiting. Suddenly I found a pile of 3 steaks on my plate, since the waiter saw we were maybe one of five tables left still eating. The food was good, but it was really not worth the hassle. Overall I give the food three stars and the service two stars. Maybe if I had bothered to go back again, the service would have been better. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Go for the martinis, don't stick around for the food. I have been here several times for tiny tini Tuesdays - a weekly event that allows you to sample their colorful and delicious martini's in tiny glasses. You order three at a time for a somewhat steep $12. If you want variety though, this is not to be underestimated. However, the food is always lacking. I went on a lunch date here and decided to go for the grilled cheese and tomato basil soup as my stomach wasn't feeling up to anything more adventurous. The grilled cheese was fine. Nothing special. The soup however had a thin drizzle of basil oil which when stirred in made the soup greasy and wholly unappetizing. Your best bet is to head there after work for the martinis and then head around the corner to Six Penn for food. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Pawn Stars: The Gift Shop. Heading North towards downtown from The Strip, I noticed the crowd outside before I even realized what this place was. Of course I've seen the show, and even meant to make a visit here if the opportunity presented itself-- and suddenly there it was in all of it's glory: Pawn Stars. This place is a short walk from Fremont Street (or a very LONG walk from The Strip). I took a few photos from the sidewalk in front and got the scoop on seeing the Pawn Stars themselves from one of the security guys outside: basically, you don't. They show up for the filming of the show, and the store is closed to the public until they've finished and gone. Pretty much exactly what I figured; but I didn't waste much time here and the pics I took didn't cost a penny. So three stars for Pawn Stars! ",0,0,1,0,0

 My visit to Leith was the 'mission' of my long awaited trip to GB. Many generations of my family hail from Leith (my grand father was a Lindsay and his mother was a Leith), so spending a few days here was truly special. I was told to find this pub, as the property had some connection to my family (the details are a bit fuzzy... I should have paid more attention when my grandparents explained the association). We found it easily - almost by accident. It was just what I had pictured. The building itself is very old - goes back hundreds of years. The pub has two very, very small rooms, one for eating and drinking and another for drinking and darts. Intimate (shoulder-to-shoulder) seating. Brick walls. Low ceiling. Even a small fireplace at one end of the room we were in. We ordered fish, which was quite good. Seemed the safest thing on the menu [well, chalk board behind the bar] for a not so adventurous American. (Folks sitting next to us had haggis... I had to avert my eyes while they ate!) I don't know if this pub is normally frequented by tourists, but we were the only non-locals in the room the night we were there, which certainly added to the charm. The atmosphere was relaxed and encouraged lingering... which we did. We whiled away the entire evening in fact, my hubby hefting pints of ale while I became acquainted with Balvenie - a single malt scotch whisky which is now my favorite. And our tab for the entire evening was under 30 pounds! Amazing. Our visit to Kings Wark is one of my favorite memories of our two weeks in GB. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Edinburgh/Leith. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place gets a C+ (good thing I gave extra credit points earned with the bathroom presentation). Pros: 1) Aesthetics - the restaurant looks great, the plate presentation looks great, even the bathrooms look great. Love the mosaic tile-job in the bathrooms. Great color scheme overall. 2) Location - it's in the Aria...can't get any closer...and if you are staying in the Cosmo/Aria/Monte - no cab fare! 3) Learn spanish while visiting the bathroom. Seriously...spanish 101 cd is going on while you sit/stand/wait in the bathrooms.....think....loungy music when you get up from the table...stroll 100 paces...enter bathroom...and you hear ""Autumn...Autumn........Beer...Cerveza..........Money...Deniro..."". You get the point. 4) Service - Our waitress was on top-of-it. She got our refills, bill, etc. at just the right time. Cons: 1) Bartender needs to go.......and here's why: I tended bar p/t for nearly 8 yrs. I give a little credit to bartenders when they are a) ""in the weeds"", b) making 5 different kinds of blended/fu-fu drinks c) dinner rush. I expect a Vegas bartender in an upscale hotel restaurant to be able to take a drink order and deliver it to the party within a reasonable amount of time. The main bartender looked as though he was so buried you'd think he was working a night club during the main 1030-11p rush. I looked around and saw every spot at the bar was taken (it only sat ~18peeps) but we were the only peeps standing around asking for a drink. The tables were full but not packed so he wasn't busy with the server's request. There were 2 other bartenders working as well. Then the servers were bringing out dishes for the patrons that were seated at the bar so he wasn't busy with that. The bartender kept going back and forth between us, the patrons at the bar, the servers running around...you get the point. We all ordered our 3 drinks total at the same time. After 15 minutes...he had provided 1...a glass of wine. We didn't order anything complicated...let's see...glass of red wine, Jeiger-RedBull (as a drink), and a Capn-Coke....nothing too crazy. No chicky Cosmo, no fu-fu frozen pina-what-cha-ma-call-it. 3 easy drinks. I looked at the bartender...and he was sweating it...again...not sure why. Then my buddy says...hey buddy....can we get the Jeiger-RedBull and Capn-coke. He is like...oh...oh yea.... no apology, no offer of a freebie or a discount. another 10 minutes he came with our drinks. We paid...and about 1 min later we were seated. 2) Prices.... I know to expect to pay more in a hotel, I know to expect to pay more in a Vegas hotel....and yet I know to expect to pay more in the ""latest and greatest hotel in Vegas"".....but come on. Seriously. $17 for 1 single lamb chop? $16 for 2 mini cheeseburgers? 3) Portions are small...even for a Tapas-style restaurant. Each person will need to order minimum of 3 dishes each. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Had my HTC My Touch 4g glass repaired here and it was AMAZINGLY reasonably priced. Everywhere else wanted $80 to $120 for repair and they did it for $55. Not sure what other phones cost (sure it varies based on phone) but to me that was a really, really great price in comparison to the other prices I was getting. Of course I was cautious because everyone knows the old adage, ""you get what you pay for"". But to all, rest assured, this is a legit company based on my experience with them AND they were able to fix my phone on the same day, ahead of the estimated timeframe. They projected it would take 2 hours, but they had it done in under an hour. Great service and I highly recommend. Ray ",0,0,0,0,1

They don't take rezzies, so this is important to note -- this is a very popular neighborhood joint and fills up fast. We showed up at about 6 on a Saturday and they were already quite busy. I started tweaking at this point, because it is stressful to navigate a crowded dining room with a w/c, and worse if there is no endpoint. But I only had to suffer for a few minutes (and I'm not even the one in the w/c, just the navigator), as they quickly squoze the three of us into a small table. The food from their small but diverse menu was a-ok and extremely reasonable, and we loved the decor of this homey corner pub in my dear Willy Street 'hood. Mom had the mustard chicken and inhaled it; sister had a bleu-stuffed pork chop and it was also quickly devoured. I had a walleye sandwich, which was not as flavorful as it could have been. The garlicky potatoes with it, however, were delish. We finished with cheesecakes all around (yummmm), and I can tell you they have a most decent beverage list, too. I really hate the stress of no rezzies, though. ",0,0,1,0,0

 After driving by 25 times or so I decided to drop in & try some cupcakes finally. The girl working the counter was bubbly, knowledgeable, & helpful. I selected 4 different cupcakes. A wedding cake, midnight chocolate chip, Peanut Butter Cup, & a Red Velvet one. Like a lot of desserts, they were quite appealing to the eye. They were very pretty cupcakes. To my disappointment the cake itself was dry & not very flavorful. I've had much better cake from a Betty Crocker box, honestly. The frostings were good, but quite excessive. I like frosting a lot & I couldn't finish it all. Lastly, the were overpriced in my opinion. $15 & some change for 4! If I'm going to pay that much, I'll just go to Sprinkles. I really wanted to like this place :-( ",0,1,0,0,0

 Meh. A ton of overpriced Hershey souvenirs set amongst a variety of Hershey candy comparable to a grocery store. They do have huge sculptures of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty made out of chocolate, which are kinda cool, but other than that, nothing. No interesting facts or history about Hershey. One bonus is the bakery section. Well, they're not actually making anything, so it's not a bakery, but a sweets shop I guess. Whatever it is, it has some pretty good stuff. We sampled the cookie and buttercream sandwich and the s'more. Both were really good, even at $5+. The coke world has this upstairs bar where you can sample different cokes from all over the world, which is super cool. Hershey world, if you're reading this, how about adding something like that???

 They have added a great deal to their menu int he last few months, the food has been a great upgrade. When one considers their great beer, headlined recently by the award winning Mecktobberfest (Great Amercian Beer Festival), this place is awesome ",0,0,0,0,1

 OMG! So excited my girlfriend introduced me to this place last night. Unbelievable. I'm sad to say I ate every piece of my 10"" pie, but SO worth it! I'm a simple girl and since I'm trying this place out for the first time I wanted to keep my order simple and basic. My pizza -- I got pepperoni, olives and roasted garlic. Holy smokes that garlic was amazing!!! The pizza was mouth-watering delicious. Everything tasted fantastic and that garlic I'm still dreaming about! We also ordered the Chopped Salad and this was also just as delicious. I think when I come here for a lunch I'll just get the large chopped salad. They mix and toss it for you, which is how I love my salads. I'm definitely going to become a regular and kudos for them and their business. This is a winner and can't wait to come back!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 The service was fine, we had a nice waitress that kept our drinks full. For the price I thought it was a pretty small bowl, and it just seems like a game they are playing. You get this small silver cat dish and when they serve it ,it comes in a large red funky shaped bowl. As if no one can figure that out. The fried rice looked ok, the noodles were disgusting. I should have refused to eat them as they made my stomach upset later in the day. Very, very greasy, sauces were sugery. They have calories on the wall and I have a sneaking suspicion they are very misleading and the calorie count is probably without the carbs and sauces.... This place is run in a guise of hoping we don't notice we are being treated like knuckleheads sardined in for an 8.99 bowl of goo. The cat dish is what? to prompt you to what upgrade to a second bowl of goo? Yes, the tables were small, there was 4 people in my party and I was afraid to move my elbow. The bill was 45 bucks without tips. ( you get reminded to tip too via signs)... For that amount of money you are better off going to the Great Greek On Warm Springs and you can eat off their family meal for a few days. By the way two people in the party were hungry later on in the day.. so after spending so much on lunch they weren't even full... seemed extra expensive on that note.... I was disappointed with the overall experience. It wasn't a total bust but I would not go back unless someone else wanted me to go. In short too much work and aggravation. Getting your own food, squeezing in and out of the tables, and too little of it for the price once you consider tax and tip. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Fantastic! Can't believe we did not see this place when in Maui. Mahi salad, coconut shrimp and fish and chips were all delicious. The staff was friendly and helpful. We can't wait to go back for more! And when we go back to Maui we will go again. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We really enjoyed this AYCE over most of the others around Vegas. My wife liked the fact that they had a lot of rice-less rolls. Where do they come up with the names for some of these rolls, lol? Not a mochi fan, but my wife is. That was her main disappointment of this place. The skin on the mochi was not silky smooth. I liked this place better than Yama Sushi. The service was better, and I think the roll choices were better. I also think the quality and taste was very good. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Place is huge, price is fair, has just about everything related to electronics.... on that note... CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!! Me went to look for TV few months ago, was early in the morning like 8-9am... walked past the counter of about 5 employees huddled around a desk, talking to each other having a grand ol' time! They don't even acknowledge your presence when you look all of them straight in the eye (i usually smile and say hi when I look at people... but I just smiled and kept walking since they didn't seem to care) So I was walking around look for a TV, found one, but didn't have a cart, luckily an employee with a cart walked by... ""excuse me, can I borrow that cart, I would like to get this TV"" employee #1 - ""sorry I have to use this one..."" hmmm... okay.... at this point i was pretty pissed off already at all of the people there... so I walked all the way to the front of the store... grabbed the damn cart myself... loaded the TV into the cart... and checked out... I made a complaint to the manager of the store when I got home, basically addressed the ""lack of customer service"" and how all the employees just like to chit-chat with each other and ignore customers.... all she said was okay, i will address it with that department... Piss-poor customer service.... I think I get better service at Walmart! Anyways... bottom line is... they have a ton of stuff, decent price.... they have a TON of EMPLOYEES that don't know anything about CUSTOMER SERVICE. (To be fair... other times when I do get help, there are decent employees.. but very few) ",1,0,0,0,0

 Really friendly and helpful staff, with a great selection of items in store to have monogrammed or personalized, or you can bring your own. I brought in a shirt to have monogrammed as a gift, the small (2x4"" ish) embroidery cost me $8. Not too bad. They asked just the right questions, matched thread colors perfectly, and it was ready in about a week. (I think it's usually less, they seemed like they were backed up for Christmas) The store is stocked with plenty of Lilly, Adler, Tervis, and anything from jewelry, glassware, stationary, linens... you name it, they can probably get your name, monogram, or sorority on it. It is a very packed little store! I will be back, especially when in need of a gift for siblings or even a great hostess gift. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I really wasn't thrilled with our meal here. The service was fine, although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini, which was about 90% breading, 10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable. I had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini, still too heavy and altogether flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though, it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera, which was, strangely enough, very spicy (though the server did warn us about this beforehand, to her credit) and again, not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly.

 When I booked our room at Mandalay Bay, it came with a deal for two complimentary tickets to a list of shows. We decided to see Zumanity since neither my cousin or I had seen a Cirque du Soleil show and we were so so so excited! Zumanity is located inside New York New York towards the back of the casino. The theater itself was comfortable, intimate, and all the plush, red colors gave off a very sexy vibe. We sat in the balcony (row EE) and we could see everything! Pretty good for free tickets ;) The show itself is more on the burlesque side and not only features acrobats and dancers, but also some fun crude humor. The show is very sensual, sexy, and fun. The live band was awesome! It's definitely not for anyone who is prude or easily offended and not appropriate for kids. In fact, they advertise their show as 21+. Some of my favorite acts were the acrobats and tissue dancers! So beautiful! However, the highlight of the show was the middle-aged lady who pretty much mounted one of the dancers and made out with his body...hilarious! I honestly wasn't sure what to expect out of Zumanity but I must say I was pleasantly surprised! It was so much fun and definitely a highlight of our Vegas trip. Keep an open mind and don't hesitate to see this show ;) ",0,0,0,0,1

 This store is a must for visiting fishermen from Hawaii. There are many items here which you only see online, in catalogs or on tv. A good friend of mine recently gave me a hot tip, try rigging the old curly tail using two beads and a prop. He said that at times, its almost like cheating. The prop is a fly fishing item, not to be found back home. It was available here in two sizes, in nickel and brass. As for clothes, its the start of spring meaning clearance on winter clothes, not too helpful for shoppers from Hawaii. I am guessing that fall would be the best time for visitors from Hawaii. Buy you beef jerky omiyage here, cheaper than in downtown. The bacon jerky was really ono (tasty)! Don't forget the obligatory Las Vegas Basspro t-shirt. ",0,0,0,0,1

 So we double dated at Bachi Burger and the first thing we notice is that smell! It smelled so good! Like my intro? The 4 of us were all Bachi virgins and our cherries were about to get popped like goes the weasel! All of us agreed to get a different burger each and a different specialty drink. I ordered the Kalbi Burger which I thought was the biggity bomb! It had kim-chee inside! It came with a side of Kim-chee style mini zucchini/cucumber, wasn't too sure what it was but it was tasty, and went well with my burger. The drink i had was the strawberry lemonade jasmine tea (no free refills). It was really pulpy so if you order it, make sure you get a glass of water too to wash it all down. And I can't forget the ox-tail chili cheese fries... Mmm! I just wish they put more ox-tail. The overall experience at Bachi was a memorable one. Service was fast, music was good, environment was comfortable, and the food was Uh-maze-zing! I will definitely be back! ",0,0,0,0,1
