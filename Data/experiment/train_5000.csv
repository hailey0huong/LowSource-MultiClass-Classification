 The location is good, and the patio can be wonderful on a winter afternoon. The food, however, seems to be about 20% overpriced for what you receive. It isn't bad, mind you, but it certainly isn't worth the prices they charge. The bar area gets very, very crowded on Friday nights, which can be good or bad, depending on what you're in the mood for. It is a nice place for drinks, and maybe appetizers. Skip it for dinner, though, and try someplace else within walking distance in old town Scottsdale. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I really, really, really wanted to like this place because my friend took me there and he loves it. First the good: great location on the strip, terrific service, decor and ambience. Just like a traditional East Coast steak house. Sides and wine were excellent: truffled mac and cheese, S&W green beans, sauteed spinach, fabulous bottle of rioja: all exemplary The problem was the steak. A big, bone in rib eye for $49 came charred on the outside, tough and overcooked. (I asked for Medium Rare), it was between Medium and Well done. Even if the temperature had been right, the charring outside was way overdone, and the quality of the cut was not great. Such a shame. But I will go go back and try another cut, perhaps the rack of lamb or filet mignon. ",0,1,0,0,0

 um...not much to really say about the place. ribs are lower end of the decent ranks. (decent is middle for me). Definitely wont order the babybacks again. thats what i had. I don't know this place was just ehhhhhhh.. nothing fantastic, i'd come back if i had a giftcertificate and i wouldn't complain. Don't think i would choose on my own accord to go here though. I'd rather go to one of those fastfood bbq places which make equally as good, sometimes better food. ",0,1,0,0,0

 $20 for one BBQ dish? Is there a wood chip shortage I don't know about? Our neighborhood welcomed Bootleggers and supported them, only to have prices hiked to oblivion. With so many great BBQ places in the valley I can't justify $19 for a turkey leg or $17 for a hot link. We used to love going there, too bad. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I don't think I could ever say good enough things about the Slider Truck, but I will try. I love being greeted with a fist bump and a smile. It's so refreshing to see people enjoy what they do for a change. The atmosphere is so positive I swear you can almost taste it in their food! My favorites are the Pep Pep, Yaya, and the Barby. A little on the pricey side, but I think it's worth it to support a local growing business. I wish I could have a full size version of their burgers. One slider just isn't doing it for me anymore. It is nice though if you are a Slidin' Thru newbie so you can try several of their flavors all in one sitting. If you are discouraged by long lines hit them up during the week for lunch hours. I've waited over an hour for these burgers though and they are worth it. Slidin' Thru is a MUST TRY at least once for all Vegas locals! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Very conveniently located, right across the street from Venetian and at 40% of the price. Also located beside Fashion Mall. Well worth the price we paid ($70 a night), because we booked in advance by a few weeks and online, with non refundable booking. Nice clean rooms, and clean linens brought everyday (As i saw complaints regarding this in prior postings on other sites). Beds were extremely comfortable, would definitely stay here again. Only downside is that the parking lot is quite a walk to the casino. ",0,0,0,0,1

 ""Meh. I've experienced better,"" fully captures how I felt about CAC. I found them here on Yelp, visited their website, and sent an email requesting membership info. I'm new to town and used to a certain quality of gym and have some requirements: Precor ellipticals, zumba and body pump classes that actually fit my schedule, and a convenient location. I don't even mind a hefty price tag because fitness is a priority for me. But I was distinctly underwhelmed by this gym. Sure, you walk in and it seems ultra swanky and exclusive- even the guy at the front desk is wearing a jacket, for crying out loud. But as I took myself on a tour of the facilities, I couldn't help but notice a few things that turned me off: the women's locker room has a ton of lockers, several bathroom stalls, and a bunch of showers.. but a tiny area to change in, with only one bench. It appears there's a push for members to pay the extra $50 for access to the private locker room. Okay, duly noted. The downstairs cardio area has the machines I like, but I was a little bummed that the models present did not have the individual screens. Rather, there were two screens for the entire cardio area, and set at a bit of a distance away. No big, I can bring in my iPad and watch Netflix while I churn out my miles right? Nope, no wifi. For $50/month, you'd think that would be a given. Upstairs wasn't much better- tons of equipment, and only a few people present, most of whom were working one on one with trainers or just sitting around. In fact, that's what bugged me most: maybe I was just there during an off-peak time, but everyone present seemed more focused on being in such a swanky environment. I don't think I saw anyone there genuinely working up a sweat. Ultimately I didn't feel very comfortable here but still wanted to give the place a try. Met up again with Juan, my tour guide who stayed at the front desk, and received what passed for the ""sales pitch""- a laminated card of their pricing, and a vague, ""So, wanna sign up?"" I had mixed feelings about that- I really didn't feel sold to or pressured, which was a plus. But I also didn't feel like any attempt at all was made to MAKE me want to join this gym. I genuinely wanted to give them a try, but the fact that I wasn't even able to get a pass for a day or two to try it out and see if I liked it was discouraging. To end on a positive note though, for the month of January their promotion is that the initiation fee is half off: to join it's usually $120 + your monthly fee based on your membership ($50 on up to like $150 to get access to kickboxing/CrossFit); but in January it's just $60.

 If you are at all serious about rare books, don't bother with this place. Although it's fun to browse, I collect antiquarian texts and have been to many stores like this as well as the annual trade shows. I'll never come back. My issues: 1) PRICE - I specialize in 19th and 20th century texts, so I can't comment on the pricing of older items. But from what I can tell, the mark-ups here are insane. (Anywhere from 40% to 100% over the prices you'll find if you run a quick Google search.) If you actually want to buy anything, you would do much better going through eBay or any independent (but ABAA-licensed!) dealer. 2) TOUCHING THE BOOKS - Maybe I just had bad luck, but the man working here would not let me touch any of the items in the glass cases. Allowing potential customers to touch the items that interest them is standard in this industry. While I understand that this store probably gets more foot traffic than any antiquarian bookstore in the country, they clearly had the supplies on hand (gloves, foam supports) so that customers could touch the books if the staff deemed them worthy. I suspect that the man who worked here did not take me seriously because I am in my twenties. Although I was dressed business-casual (was on my way to dinner), you'd think I was Julia Roberts at the beginning of Pretty Woman. Big mistake. Big. Huge! I have to go shopping now. 3) STAFF - On a related note, the guy working here was incredibly patronizing, again (I suspect) because of my age. He didn't seem to know much about the David Foster Wallace book I was interested in (fair enough, everyone has their specialties). But instead of answering my question or admitting he didn't know the answer, he launched into a spiel about why we put mylar covers on dust jackets. Compelling. When I asked about the provenance of a book, he told me that it came from a ""private individual"" and that he couldn't give me any more information than that because of privacy concerns. Fine. But then he added that it's ""typical"" for antiquarian booksellers not to give customers any information about where they got the books--which is objectively not true. I have worked with a number of rare booksellers and ""typically"", they bend over backwards to give me information about what I'm looking at (all while respecting the privacy of the person they got the book from, obviously). And even if they don't have that info, they would never make me feel bad for asking. The impression I came away with was that Bauman does not care at all about their customers--not enough to charge them fair prices, and not enough to treat them with respect when they visit the store. Such a shame. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I visited Earl of Sandwich again because it's become pretty much a routine stop for me whenever I go to Vegas. How can you really resist a $6 sandwich on the strip which is available at any time of the day? This time I decided to try their Italian - (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=V-B0qTxJLuV3PHECKwuAuw). It's got Salami, Capicola, Roasted Ham, Mortadella, Zesty Italian Dressing, Mozzarella & Roma Tomatoes. It's a pretty good sandwich but I wouldn't say it's my favorite. That honor still belongs to the Original 1762. Always open and always dependable you can never go wrong with Earl of Sandwich. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've been studying with Mahin for about a year now and it has been some of the best time, energy and money spent on anything in my life. I've always loved to dance but never invested this much in any style and frankly exercise has never been my favorite word. Now I can't imagine not showing up every week for class. It's become a part of my life; keeping stress at bay and giving me an outlet for my creativity. Mahin challenges us every day but keeps the atmosphere casual and welcoming; working patiently with each student until they get it. She not only shares the steps of the dance but also it's cultural signficance really giving us an appreciation and understanding of it in context. If you are looking for a teacher who is patient, fun and challenging, I cannot recommend Mahin highly enough. You'll work your butt off in her class but I guarantee you'll enjoy it. Oh and I also wanted to add that she is very active in the local belly dancing community which is especially helpful to new students who find that they want to get involved and become a part of it. It's not required of course but the opportunity is there. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Went to the Wicked Spoon on a Sunday night. Their price has recently gone up to $35. I think there are other buffets in Vegas which have better tasting food for less price. At first, the small dish thing looks nice. But here are some of my observations. Because most of the dishes are in its own small dish, all the food seems to be cold, from the lobster bisque I had to potato gatin.. also, since they are already portioned out, there is no way for you to try just a bite to see what something tastes like. So I ended up taking, but only taking one small bite and not finishing the rest because it either did not taste to my liking. Waste of food. The other thing is that there is only so many small dishes you can carry. So you end up taking a lot of trips to the bar. There were 3 things I really wanted to try from reading the reviews here... the crab claws, risotto, shu-mai. None of those things were available. In general, most of the dishes were very salty or very sweet. The lamb at the carving table was really tough and not edible. And the chocolate used in the desserts seemed like plastic. For me the best dishes were the cold shrimp cocktail (the shimp was bing and plump), and the spinach salad. Other than that, the food you get at the buffet at Green Valley Ranch is much more tasty (and cheaper too!) ",0,1,0,0,0

 First time here. I was recommended by a girlfriend at work. Super friendly staff. Loved how quick the process was. In and out in 15 minutes but never felt rushed. I've been a couple of places where they also use hard wax but this wax was definitely different. A lot smoother than any wax I've ever experienced. I had Jennifer. She was great and got down to business. I never once felt uncomfortable with her. She constantly checked to see how I was doing. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I hate to 2 star this place since the food really is exceptional, but in a city where there are a million restaurants willing to take your $100/head meal, you are going to have to do way better than just have good food. The bar staff really needs a lot of work here... The whole bar staff was clearly fake. You feel like you are the centerpiece of a southern belle dinner. The tone of their conversation to you, and the stupid jokes they drop could pass very well if you were on the croquet court hanging with the Docker's models all with pink sweaters worn over your shoulders. They were like airline stewardesses with plastic smiles chiseled into their faces. (Hopefully, one of those analogies rang a bell with you...). This whole environment made me feel ultra-uncomfortable, which of course made me very nitpicky... I sat down at the bar since I was dining alone, and the bartender asked me what I wanted to drink. I told him that I really liked traditional drinks, and wondered if he had something awesome in his back pocket that he could mix up. He told me that they made ""award winning"" appletinis, cosmos, and some other glammed up sugar bullshit. Seriously, this is the best you could think of?? minus 1. So, I asked him for a gin martini, and wanted to know what gin he had on the bar. He could only list the boring shit off the top of his head (tanq, bombay, etc.), he had to go sift through the bar to figure out the interesting kinds of gin he had. He then asked if I wanted a twist. This seems to be a major problem with Vegas since I got asked it at more than one classy place...martinis have olives. *ALWAYS*. If you ask if I want olives or a twist, then you clearly don't know how to make a martini. Minus another 1. He then makes my martini and gives me the check. No mention of food or anything. At this point, I'm convinced that he was trying to kick me out of the place. Like, to the point where I started looking around at how other people were dressed. I also thought about trying to find a mirror to see if I had a giant booger stuck to my chin. I nearly walked out after paying for my drink, but the bartender did notice *after I had finished the whole drink* that maybe I would want some food, and asked if I wanted a menu. I decided to give the food a spin, and was treated to a fantastic swordfish. Like I mentioned before, kudos to the chef...its sad that his great meal was really hurt by bad service. With the exception of the cool wine tower/cellar thing in the middle of the room, the bar decor sucked...it might as well have been a wall street bank. I dunno, maybe it would be cool if you were here for a business dinner, or if you wanted to shag your significant other. I couldn't think of any other party that may feel less out of place here.

 What can I say about Execucar. I love their service. It cost just as much if not cheaper than taking a cab for me. I make a reservation on-line, get confirmation via email as well as a phone call the day before confirming my reservation. The cars are always nice, clean, and fresh smelling (yes that may seem weird but I have been in some cabs that were like WHOA!) The drivers are always in shirts, ties, and slacks and they are professional and courteous. I have never had a driver be late (knock on wood) and they have always gotten me to the airport on-time.

 What I initially thought was going to be a quick stop for tasting a few brews before grabbing dinner, resulted in tasting a few brews and then having a few more. I'm not quite sure what I expected, but it surpassed all my expectations. My water glass was never empty (a pet peeve of mine), except when I was leaving. The bartender was the right amount of attentive. And the brews! Very good. I ordered the flight. The Fuggle (India Brown Ale) was my favorite from that bunch. Since they had more of their brews on tap, I tried Penguin, #2 Strong, and their Sour per reviews on here. And I've got to say...the #2 Strong was really delicious. I would highly recommend it to anyone. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Vegas ... how do you choose a restaurant? I think most of them are really pretty average for the outrageous prices (and I don't mind spending money on food - as long as it's good). My husband was immediately put off by the 10 minute wait for the waiter to get our wine order. I'm okay with a slow dinner, but if you're not, pay attention. The wine list was decent, nothing special. The wine my husband chose (even though I am usually the wine-chooser) was gone, so the waiter did a substitute for us that was okay. We had some oysters - they were $3 in the menu, but he informed us that they had just jumped to $4 because they were bigger (I'd hate to see what they were before, these were not large by any means). He had the tomato soup, which came with mini grilled cheese, he loved it. I had a filet mignon, cooked just fine, but wasn't that tender. He had the Tomahawk rib-eye, which was decently flavored. The sides were nothing special at all. Overcooked asparagus, mashed potatoes that need the sauce they served the steak with (first clue: steak needs no sauce if it is truly stellar). He had the mac 'n cheese, I am anti-cheese, but he liked it. The service was merely okay. If I am paying this much, I want a server with some charisma, though. This one lacked it. We didn't bother with dessert, it was just too ordinary of a restaurant for a $280 bill for 2. Go elsewhere for your money. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I went in alone after work for a beer. The place is lovely with a nice pub feel and it's in a part of town where very nearby tavern options are limited. The beer selection was great and the servers were sweet. But, I ordered the poutine for dinner and it was gross. Gravy came on the side and was overpoweringly oniony. Worse, the fries were covered with provolone and OREGANO. Just pounds of oregano. Blech. I'd go again for just a beer, but will likely avoid the food. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I went here because we had a coupon for bogo buffet. We paid $20 even for two people. Pretty cheap for Vegas! OK, so we walk in and notice that it is a really pretty buffet.

I had whipped potatoes (generic), sauteed mushrooms (decent), and a piece of pizza (good but not worthy of $10), and a few random dessert cakes, as well as half a bowl of broccoli soup (meh). My boyfriend ate much more than me so it wasn't totally a bust, but for me, I still left with something to be desired. For a buffet they spent so much creating, they could really focus on the food.

 Although I have just had my first visit, I can only say, what a relief. For over a year, after an auto collision, I have had minor aches, pains, and migraines. I have had several Dr. Appts with a family physician. Well after reporting all symptons, and ekgs and xrays, I hear nothing is wrong. So I make excuses. Maybe its migraines and weight gain from hormones or I need a new bed so my back doesnt hurt. My hands go numb because I had them in the wrong position, my eyes blur cause I need glasses, my foot hurts because of weight gain. Ugh. Then they gave me a questionairre for bipolar disorder and I didnt go back! So that was it. Long story short, life lead me to Dr. Blanton. Im overwhelmed and delighted to know I am not bipolar, I am in fact not crazy. We found the answers. And relief has begun. Thank you ",0,0,0,0,1

 The only reason I gave 2 stars is because my mom loves this place and I did get a pedicure there by Kim once which was great...that was 2 years ago. I came back to vegas to see my parents and my mom wanted to treat me to a pedicure so I said let's go here. We walked in and my mother said that she was getting a mani and her son (me standing right next to her) was getting a pedi. My mom got in right away with a sweet female stylist and the cute blonde girl who came in after us got seated for a pedi for a male stylist. At first I didn't care and I sat there, waiting. No update, no ""sorry for the wait,"" no existence acknowledgment at all for about 30 minutes. Next, after that 30 minutes of ignoring me, an older couple walks in and the lady wanted a pedi/mani, of course, she gets sat by another male stylist. So I spoke up and said, ""excuse me, I was waiting for a pedi as well."" His response, ""I don't do guys"" YOU DON'T DO GUYS?? Look I'm not gay, but I have no problem having a guy giving me a pedicure. How are you supposed to make any money if you have people working for you that don't do same sex feet?! Get the eff outta here. The worst part about this is IF only women do guys feet, and guys to women feet, why didn't the woman doing my mom's nails take my feet and the guy take my mom's nails? I'm no business owner, but I believe that's a loss of $40. Not sure what 5 years of management in the Navy for customer service get's me, but the customer shouldn't have to ask for updates. Someone should have at least said, ""sorry for the wait"" or something like that. You give the customer a timeline. Also, back to the pretentiousness of saying, ""I don't do guys feet."" If it is a policy, say that...that's it. ""Our company policy is that men don't do men's nails"" would be the proper response. People think people from Southern California are pretentious, just come here and you'll realize just how pretentious Vegas can be.

The rooms are gorgeous, the pools are so relaxing (although we had a hard time finding chairs) and the bars are cool too. Me and my boo ate at culinary dropout which was soooo good. I love the Hard Rock brand. It's just really cool. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Do not get any eye treatments at this place! The front office staff is very unprofessional in appearance & demeanor! The office as a whole is terribly unorganized! I went for a regular eye exam a few days ago & now I'm having to get my eyes checked again because my left eye has been really itchy & irritated since my appointment! The only positive I have about this place is that they had a really cute frame that I wanted but that's it! ",0,1,0,0,0

 While I connect through McCarran regularly for Southwest flights, I've not actually checked in here in about 6 years. How things have changed. I'm thankful a colleague warned me about the ridiculously long security lines, otherwise I'd have likely missed my flight. Masses of humanity, slow security lines, and grotty bathrooms makes McCarran resemble the Delhi Airport. It pains me to think of what this airport will be like when the 30,000 new hotel rooms currently under construction are completed. Ouch. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Bad service!! First off the bar was sticky...a bit gross. Ordered a pork dish, but they brought me the wrong one...the guy down the bar got mine... For as expensive as this place is that's really unacceptable. Rather than make a fuss I said I was fine... There was no offer for a free drink or anything for the mistake...would have been a nice gesture... The waiter did say to someone that a mistake happened but we were both fine... He could have been much better. Overall the good was good but a bit heavy. The service was a total failure, ",0,1,0,0,0

 Tonight was date night. The BF wanted to try Tia Rosa since we have been awaiting the arrival for sometime now. It is within walking distance so of course we had HIGH hopes for this place. And we were pretty disappointed. Pros 1. Loved the decor. They went ALL out on this. Really does make you feel like you are in mexico. 2. The Bean Dip App was delish. We really LOVED every bite of it. 3. We went around 5 and was seated very promptly. 4. Margarita were pretty good but nothing to really rave about. Id prefer a mexican place with good margarita specials. 5. THey were quick and prompt with refilling my water. 6. The service was very prompt as far as getting our drinks and food to the table. Cons 1. Service. Our waitress was not the friendliest. I asked if she recommended a margarita and she really didn't have a good answer. Kinda pointed at a few things but there was no, ""O Yes, You should def try..."" I think being a new place in a new location the staff should be very informative and up beat.. When we ordered the enchiladas, we were told we could not have one beef and one chick. We had to pick one meat and one sauce. Not mix and match. Kinda odd, I said to her Ive never been to a place that doesnt allow that. Is there a reason? (bc maybe there is), she said I don't know. Ok then. I think with the economical status we are in, there must be more energetic upbeat people dying for a job. 2. Price. We had an app, 2 Margaritas, 2 entrees and split a friend ice cream. And our bill was $60. For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone. 3. Chips. Each time we got chips there were about 15-20 per basket, the were constantly needing to refill them. Even with our BIG bowl of app bean dip, it came with about 20 chips and the bowl of dip was HUGE, the chip porportion was way off! 4. Extra sour cream, $1.00. WOW! And in the middle 1. Fried Ice Cream, it was friend ice cream with strawberries. I really prefer the honey over the strawberry anyday. Wasnt my fave. And I LOVE fried ice cream. 2. Chips and Salsa were ok. Nothing to rave, I would say average. I think with the place being new and in a great location, the management would be more hands on. I love more than anything when a manager walks the floor to check on the customers. I think that is AWESOME. But this didn't happen while I was there. In the end, I wanted to ask for the manager and tell them to go across the way and step inside Oreganos. BC those people that work over there are the friendliest and Happiest people Ive ever seen in the food service. I would say to give Tia Rosa a chance and see what you think But in my opinion, I've had much better as far as mexican goes. I look forward to the other side opening to see the menu and prices. I would def love to see if they have a happy hour bc Id love to go for the bean dip and Margaritas :) ",0,1,0,0,0

 If you want retirement center atmosphere and cuisine look no further! Every menu item has some weird twist to it (ex. tuna fish panini... On cranberry bread) which really made it difficult to order as their menu was already very limited. I even had to special order my caeser salad to NOT have anchovies on it. The art/furniture all look as though it was collected from someone's attic or garage sale, but for what it's worth the service was fine. ",0,1,0,0,0

 What more could I say about this place in leu of all other reviews? Well for one, I can say is this: For the price, the large quantity, taste and quality and great customer service gives this place a 5 star and no less. A must try for the newbies out their is the meatjun, fantastic! They recently added a Chinese Menu which, unfortunately, makes it much more difficult to decide what to eat. If you aren't sure what you're appetite is feeling like, the server an owners spend more than enough time to explain everything on the menu. Seating is sometimes limited due to locals who eat here on a daily basis but do not fear, expansion is near! The owners informed me that they will be expanding the restaurant this year to maximize seating occupancy! If you do find yourself waiting for a table however, the servers treat you with their famous boiled peanuts as an appetizer for the wait. They are also very attentive to their customers and always work quick to keep their customers satisfied. Last tip. If you see the owners son (cute boy with the nose piercing) say hello! He is the most friendliest server ever! And tell him Sam Kim sent you HAHA! ",0,0,0,0,1

 It should be a zero. Today, Sunday the 1st of Dec. 2013, was the first and probably my last time I'll spend time and $$ at this joint. I gave it a 2 stars. Only because the cashier and the writers at the sport's book were 4.5 stars as they should be. The problem lies within the beverage employees behind the bar, bartenders. I just drop 2 ""C"" notes on sport's bets and also had $150 in the video poker machine at the bar. Problem: I returned from the book. I said a little loud, ""I need a bartender"". 1. The two gave a stare/look to kill. Remember I'm the customer and I don't drink alcohol. 2. The lead said my name is J----n and reached out to shake my hand and mentioned the co-worker's name. 3. I asked for an ice tea. I got my tea. From that moment on, I had the plague. Totally ignored. Their eyes had FU when they walk by me as they worked. They knew how much I was playing with. Besides, I was an invited guest by two regular customers. One, who just retired from Boyd gaming , who rant and raved about this place. My other friend from Ventura who was also disgusted by the double standard. 3hours at the bar and only 1 ice tea. Asked for a another drink and didn't get one. Not even asking me if everthing is okay. Man, that was one hellava expensive ice tea($350). Is there a ""PC"" for the last legal drug dealers in America (bartender)?. I'm a plus 25yrs northwest resident of Vegas. Work in Silicon Valley and might go viral. I have many good friends who can. . Go there at your risk of shame. I used NO pronouns!

 Went in there with a coupon from the Entertainment Guide without realizing it was family style mainly. However, it was 5 pm, they weren't busy yet--except the bar had some action--and they were very gracious about it all. I appreciated that. First, the prices were ok for what they offer. Next and mainly, the food was ok. Not bad at all, not great but ok. I had veal with artichokes/prosciutto/lemon sauce. Very tasty actually with 3 big veal pieces, so expect to take some home if you are alone. The sauce on top was really yummy, but then I'm a lemon freak. The bread they serve before eating with olive oil (good quality) and balsamic was ok. The bread quality could upgrade I think. Again, ok. The service: I had a tall, dark, handsome young man wait on me that was such a good waiter I think I told him like 3 times--something I don't ever do. So, I would go back since I have more coupons for the food which is average Italian to me, but the service was deeeeeevine. I must have hit the right night and the right waiter. All in all, it's ok. Even better ok with a coupon. And, if I had a family, we would go there for sure as it's a fun event for a family with things like sundaes for 6 people and big, gigantic salads to share ($12 +/-). On second thought: Everyone working there was super helpful and friendly, so I am guessing they have a really superior general manager there. Kudos to all working there, tho, cause I was really impressed the service stood out so much and was so good! Second visit yesterday at 2:30 pm: Yeah, this was an off-hour for eating, but I was hungry and tired of making stir-fry at home; so, I ventured into Bucca for a second shot at the saltimabucco or whatever the same veal dish is called. First of all, on the menu there are 5 veal pieces. The first time I ate there I got 4, but this afternoon--FOR THE SAME PRICE OF $21.95 (I think it is)--I got 3 (THREE). To further explain, I got 3 OVERCOOKED veal pieces with prosciutto that was so overcooked it looked almost like bacon on top (where you could find it that is). I mentioned to the overworked (it appeared) waitress that the prosciutto was pretty skimpy and she pointed to one of the little curled pieces and said, ""no, there it is."" Obviously, this is the crap coming out of the kitchen at this time. I had the saltimabucco and one glass of weak as hell (and not very good) iced tea for over $26 and some cents!!!! WTF!!! I'll give this one more shop and then Bucca can shove it. If I want to be screwed--at least--someone can come out from the kitchen and kiss me along with it!!!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 The only reason this place is getting two stars is for their service. My boss wanted to order from here last week and their menu was not working online. I called and asked if they could fax it and their fax machine was also not working. They had someone deliver a menu to my office (they don't even deliver food). That's a good start! Or so I thought. Not sure if everyone is drunk when they review this place or what but the food was horrible. No one in my office was satisfied with their food. I ordered the Supreme Tostada Nacho and it ended up missing half of the things that are listed as being on it (fried jalapenos, avocado lime salsita, cilantro, etc). It was some bland beef, bland fake cheese and a little real cheese on top of greasy chips. Not sure how they can pride themselves on their nachos when I could get better ones from Taco Bell. Another co-worker got steak street tacos - she said they were bland and nothing to write home about. The wings were also not very tasty. So much for a new lunch spot downtown for us.... ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is just good. I have been twice now and regret not eating here sooner. I have only been in the dining area so I can't speak for the rest of the place, but apparently there is a beer garden, cigar room, full bar and outdoor seating. my fellow yelper buddy, Ethan Z., has been trying out some pastrami sandwiches in my honor. I decided to try out the pastrami sandwich here just for him! Too bad he couldn't be here to taste it because it was damn good. I also tried a chili cheese dog that was very good. The dog had homemade beer chili, cheese and green onions on it. The dog came with a side of fries that were good especially dipped in their homemade ranch. I would order both again and probably will. The service here is great and the servers checked on us often. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I'm a sucker for delicious pizza by the slice! This place is so fun, from discovering it down the unmarked hallway (3rd floor) to the fun decor in the small space. It really captures the pizza by the slice experience of other great cities! The hallway is lined in album covers, many of which are signed. It opens up a little bit into the shop that has counters along the walls and a pin ball machine. Pizza: they have NY style or Sicilian. I have always gone for classic NY. Pies are out on display and cost around $4-5 per slice. Once you select, they toss it in the oven to heat and crisp it then serve it on lined paper plates. Beer is on tap as well as sodas and water. It's no secret how delicious this pizza is! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I'm not sure yet if digestif is great, but it is seriously good. From start to finish we were pleasantly suprised and the waiter did a great job making suggestions starting with cocktails. I can't remeber the exact name, but the Nob Hill cocktail was a winner with my date. She flipped for it and I was wise enough to write down its ingredients. The house salad was good, the entrees- especially the scallops were fantastic and the dessert (choclate brownie something) was a lump of gooey choco deliciousness.

 My sister and I traveled to Charlotte to attend to some family business. Make no mistake, what we were doing was work. But we made time for meals and the occasional cocktail or three. We Yelped, of course, and found 5Church. Damn were we lucky to have stumbled onto this gem. It's located just off the Tryon commercial strip that offers a number of upscale chain restaurants. Not what we were looking for, nor were they serving, to our good fortune. 5Church was serving their all day Sunday brunch menu. We sat at corner of the bar where they served the full menu- a limited selection, but with a number of interesting possibilities. I opted for the hanger steak and fries, which came with their own C-1 sauce. It was delicious. The beef was perfectly seasoned and seared. The sauce should be bottled. Bob, the burly bearded bartender, asked for our drink order. I asked for a margarita with whatever tequila he recommended. Bob asked if I wanted the best margarita I'd ever had. He did not disappoint. He muddled fresh limes and oranges, covered them with ice and simple syrup. Then he added a good measure of (wait for it) Cuervo Gold. Cocktail shaken. Glass rim salted. Drink decanted, fruit and all. Fantastic. We returned Monday night to our same seats and met Evan, a young mixologist on a mission. After Goose martinis, we extolled Bob's awesome margarita. Evan took that as a challenge and produced a signature cocktail he was perfecting, The Peppadew Pepper Lemonade. Muddled lemons, vodka, Peppedew pepper juice, cayenne pepper. Shake to a froth. Top off with a splash of ginger ale. Garnish with the pepper. Sweet, tart, spicy, refreshing. Delicious. The food was as good as on Sunday. We went back two more times in the four days we were in town. We had a lamb burger (me, awesome) and crispy beet sliders (she). I'm not a fan of beets, but the sister loved these fantastic bites. Met the owners who told use they'd been open for just 6 weeks. 5Church should break the curse of other establishments that had failed at the corner of 5th and Church. I'm looking forward to returning as soon as I can find a reason. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Just a quick update... it's been almost three months since my initial review for Twirl. While there was a glitch in ordering a dress for an upcoming wedding that I'm in (think major delay in it arriving), the ladies at Twirl went above and beyond to take good care of me... While my dress was extremely delayed and at one point, we weren't sure if it would arrive in time, they made up for the delay by comping me a couture dress just in case. They couldn't have been more apologetic or sweeter to deal with, and it worked out just fine... my dress arrived and it's being altered as I type. Just in time for the wedding I need it for! In addition, my bridesmaid's dresses arrived early, and they are more beautiful than I remembered. Thanks again, Twirl, for taking such good care of me and my girls!

 Family-owned, operated, crafted. Just the kind of place I like to learn about. Though I'm not much of a chocoholic, I love the art of chocolate and checking out small shops like SC. The aroma alone that you're pummeled with upon entering is enough to make your sweet tooth swoon. After months of dillydallying and unfortunately only being in the area on Mondays (when they are closed) we finally got a chance to check out the assortment of chocolates and other products. Had a great time chatting with the owners and hearing a little about their story. We ended up grabbing 6 different truffles -- White Chocolate Pumpkin, Serrano Pepper and Chocolate, Cardamom, Milk Chocolate, and I can't remember the other 2. All were absolutely fantastic. True to their respective flavors without being overpowering, understated, or boring. The most interesting by and large was the cardamom. The kicker? Drinking chocolate. Think hot chocolate, but 10x as rich, and not with an overly present dairy flavor. It was so decadent and pleasing to sip on. It was in a tiny cup, but man a little bit goes a long way. I'd highly recommend to anyone, especially if you've never tried anything like it before. They also sell a bunch of other bar chocolates, cakes, and....cakes in jars. I'd never heard of anything like this before, but I'm so intrigued. Can't wait to check one out for the sheer fact that it's a freaking cake in a jar! Thank, Secret Chocolatier, for being so amazing!

 Yelp surprised me with this one. Since I moved from the East Valley I've been looking for a place that was as thorough and as cheap as QC Reflexology in Gilbert. I was anxious that this would fit the bill. The massage itself was ok but there were a few things that really impacted the experience. First, the community space. It's difficult to get fully relaxed when the gentleman to your immediate right is emitting some impressive snoring. Also, the lighting is too harsh. Finally, our 90 minute massage clocked in a 72 minutes. Their giant digital clock on the wall helped document that large oversight in timing. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Went here a month ago b/c of a Groupon offer. I should've passed on the Groupon and applied the money towards a better hotel. We did not get a strip view (as promised on Groupon) upon arriving. We asked to upgrade to a suite and was told they had it available which made me slightly happier. After 30 mins of, an obviously new front desk worker, tapping away at his computer he tells us it is non smoking which is a no-no for us. That started our trip with 2 let downs. The room was decent, bathroom was decent. Not decent enough for their regular price they charge tho. Their casino? Extremely boring.

 I've come here on many occasions and can't say I've had the best experiences.

Why didn't they just fix it in the first place. The pomegranate margarita was amazing as always. We sat at the bar and were in front of the drink station where the one bartender continued to obnoxiously slam glasses down when making drinks which was completely unnecessary.

I returned to get a fill & Ken did a great job! He knew exactly how I liked my nails. I returned this past Sunday & I almost walked out. The girl sitting at the Receptionist station did not even look up when I walked in. She was too interested in her phone. Really? I stood there for about 2 mins. Finally a young girl stepped up to ask me what I needed. The only reason I stayed was because she was friendly, pleasant & very helpful. I think she is the owner's daughter. The color change was just so so & when I asked her to file my nails a bit you could tell she really didn't want to. So I added $2 to her original $2 tip. She barely filed them. Not worth the $11 ($7 charge plus $4 tip). And they only accept cash for the tip. No one there is especially friendly except for the person who did my pedicure and the young girl. Maybe they don't care if they get repeat business or not? Not sure if I will return. ",0,1,0,0,0

 So now they've nixed the potstickers, the asiago dip, the portabella sandwich, and the fried mozz appetizers. They also changed their fries away from the thinner variety to a more traditional & common medium thickness. They just can't get it right, can they? Beers are the only reason to come back. Who knows what they'll do with the menu next?! ",0,1,0,0,0

 We go to PF Changs at least once every couple of months. I have never been disappointed by their food. Their orange peel shrimp is the bomb. We like it extra spicy. You can ask for white and brown rice. The black pepper prawns served with the mustard sauce are amazing but are best eaten fresh right over there. They get all soggy if you do takeout. Have you ever eaten their desserts? Try the Great Wall of Chocolate. It is huge. One order is good for like 6 people. Or if you are a chocolate lover like me...maybe good for just one. Giggles... The service is sometimes not up to par but eventually it all works out. Lately it hasn't been that busy when we go, even on weekends but it is always good to call about half an hour before you get there on weekend nights because you never know how long the wait is going to be.

 I'm member for two years. Lately me and my wife we do not have the time to drive to the fitness because of the kids practise every other day. We decide to cancel the Month to Month contract. First takes over 20 minutes on the phone. Second they will charge you for the next Month fee because they need 30 days notice. Third they will charge you a yearly fee. So it may looks affordable but if you decide to cancel does not look that audible anymore. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Love this place... Great happy hour specials and the two guys running the bar and kitchen are awesome. They never try to push you to order anything extra, they don't force you to hurry.. They are very laid back , attentive.. Never charged me for any extras or messed up our food. You cannot beat their $1 oysters and their burger combo ( fries, cheese and mushrooms included) for under 5 bucks. My brother tried the seafood omelette, and was impressed with the taste and the price. The only thing is that they don't have the best beer specials, however that is easy to overlook with all the other great things this place has to offer. We are going to come back every chance we get.. I'm looking forward to trying their regular menu. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Heard many good things about this place and went last night for the first time for a dinner I organized with 6 friends. It will probably be my last time there. The interior is oddly laid out and somewhat cold, and we were seated at a table between the front door and the bathroom, about 5 feet from each. Our waiter took our dinner order without writing any of it down. He immediately repeated the order back to us, getting it wrong. Then he reappeared 10 minutes later to confirm our orders once again. Dude, write them down already! The portions were tasty but very small for the price, and it would have been nice to have more than one tiny piece of dry bread. Perhaps, even the option of butter? But the service was my greatest complaint. Even though the restaurant was only half full, people were wandering around like zombies looking for their waiters who had disappeared completely. Our waiter kept interrupting our table's single conversation without making any effort to be graceful about it....yes, there is a right way to do it without seeming obtrusive. And the men's room desperately needed some cleaning and attention. Wanted to like PastaBAR very much, but probably won't waste any more time on it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 From the moment you walk in they make you feel like your home. Very welcoming staff, lots of refills, they don't rush you out the door, in that aspect, I would give them 4 stars. However, food is the most important thing to review in my opinion. Unfortunately after eating here 4-5 times I must say that everything I have eaten has tasted just like a frozen dinner. Maybe I'm just choosing the wrong items? Each time I've gone, I have always selected one of they're daily specials -- I would assume that you don't screw up a daily special, correct? Today I went with the chicken stir fry. Chicken was grilled at some point (grill marks) and was very dry. Veggies were drowned in sauce (seemed like they've been sitting in a tub with sauce for a while & then heated up). White rice was rice was fine. Lunch special came with a salad and piece of bread. Salad had shredded lettuce, a piece of cucumber, a tomato slice, and an onion string. I'm sure I will be back as my coworkers visit this place frequently. But from a food standpoint, I give the place a SOLID 2. ",0,1,0,0,0

 If this production was an Asian kid, he would definitely get an 'A' and make his parents proud. The acting isn't as stellar as cast in New York, but the theatre blows the Majestic Theatre out of the water. From the chandelier to the ceiling to the fake box seats to the stairwells... awesome. They do cut a lot of dialogue out compared to the production in New York, but you do have all of the same songs still in there. I've seen Phantom in Vegas 3 times now. All great, no complaints. I do suggest you buying your tickets via Tix 4 tonight. The ones I usually use are located at Casino Royale (right next to Venetian towards Harrahs) and at the Fashion Show Mall (across the street from Wynn or Treasure Island). You can save up to 50% on tickets. Pretty sweet deal if you ask me. The only catch is that they only sell tickets the day of or the day before, so you can't really plan on buying tickets before your trip through them. Whatever though, just go see it. P.S. there is no intermission, so don't get too sloppy. I was pretty hammered my second time seeing it there and I was about to flood my aisle like Katrina. ( o Y o ) ",0,0,0,0,1

 I just returned from my Vegas trip and I can't tell you how much fun I had! Chris was able to get me on the list for many of the top clubs in Vegas and I didn't have to pay a cent. Many places even gave complimentary drink passes! My girlfriends and I were able to bypass the long lines and not pay the $20 cover most places charge. It was my first time going to pool parties and Chris was able to put us on the list for those too. We got to go Daylight at Mandalay Bay and Rehab at Hard Rock. It you haven't tried the pool parties, you will experience a new level of fun. The clubs we attended were Ghostbar at Palms, Tryst, Tao and Lavo. Chris has access to many others, but you are able to choose from a list of clubs. I enjoyed Tryst and Tao because they were so beautiful! But the music at Lavo was awesome if you like hip-hop. Check out Chris' website! He gives daily updates to remind you which list you are on and what the check-in times are. He was also able to make changes if you text him. I will definitely use his service again. Why spend the money on clubs if you don't have to? ",0,0,0,0,1

 The Internet connection is so slow. I could barely check e-mail. The televisions are inconveniently placed in the family suites. The beds are stiff and the water in the sink and shower smell and tastes severely of bleach. The walls are so thin just having a conversation in normal tones in our room brought a noise complaint. The bar closes way too early although the bartender Valerie was a charming woman, very skilled at mixing drinks. The rides were fun but the stairs to get there were not. At least we avoided sunburns, although it was rainy outside anyways. The games around the hotel look like fun, but too expensive for our tastes. The main gift shop had some decent jewelry. The second gift shop was kind of hidden but had some neat stuff in it. The wave pool was lame. The food was a bit overpriced, but I did take advantage of the omelette bar, just be up really early for it. Probably never coming back because it's all too expensive. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I went here today for our company's department ""holiday brunch"" and the best thing I can say was at least I wasn't the one paying. There were roughly 30 in our group which isn't an easy task to handle so the buffet style version of fajitas made sense to serve. There was a choice of either chicken or beef with rice and beans, taco size tortillas all the food was served barely warm with little flavor. You could indulge in sour cream & the salsa that probably came from a jar, also no flavor. I got the rice with no flavor and the chicken that came with a bonus 2 inch bone, luckily I survived to write this review. The decor is still slightly charming with photos of Geronimo & James Dean although the once famous sawdust was removed due to falls, their saloon girl still hangs from the ceiling but she too is desperate need of a makeover! The employee uniforms are dated, but the service was decent. This once beloved & famous landmark type restaurant is unfortunately on it's way to becoming a ghost town! ",0,1,0,0,0

 It's not a good sign when your restaurant serves something that is so bad, your customer is still talking about how bad it was literally half of a year later. And that's exactly what happened the last time I ordered a grilled tomato basil veggie sandwich here. Seriously, take that shit off your menu. It was an absolutely foul excuse for cooking that had to have been conjured up by an extremely high, extremely overweight vegetarian. I don't know what I could even call that thing. Was it some kind of attempt at a new twist on pizza? It certainly was saturated in enough crappy cheese and tomato sauce to seem like it. That floppy piece of tomato-soaked toast on the bottom might have been part of an aborted attempt at a sandwich. And why do all the vegetables have the same taste and texture as tofu? How do you even screw that up, and why on a ""veggie sandwich""? Hawk's has a pretty good beer selection in addition to very friendly bartenders. So as a bar they're doing an okay job. This is unfortunately just about all they have going for them. The burgers and fries are unmemorable, there are no waiters, the kitchen staff (from whom you must order and pick up like a cafeteria) is surly, and the bar only takes cash - which doesn't help given that this place is expensive as fuck.

 I already don't like buffets so when I came here after having to wait in line for 40 mins I was seriously disappointed. Most of the food was just standard fare with some of the Middle Eastern stuff being interesting. Unlike the Bellagio where I ate until I felt like my stomach would pop I ate very sparingly here. The only memorable thing that happened here was my friend telling me that he wanted me to go with him to the 24 hr marriage chapel to be the witness (and take pics) so he could get hitched with his girl that nite.. while I was trying to get some lamb chops.. it seemed kinda surreal at the moment.

 I have always wanted to see Elton John live in concert, With his Caesar's run about to be over, I pulled the trigger and bought tickets. Were they expensive, HELL YA. Were they great seats, HELL YA Was it worth it, HELL YA We sat in section 5, 6 rows from the stage, Elton sat in front of us all night and played the piano. The only bummer was they allowed the first 5 rows on stage during Saturday Night Alright for Fighting and we missed it by 1 row. Elton played 19 great songs, he was defiantly having fun and loved the applause showered upon him by the audience. Even kicking out one of the security guards who was trying to stop somebody in the first row from stop dancing. The video screen behind the band and on the piano really added a touch to the show. Elton has not lost a beat. He put on a amazing show. It ranks up there with one of my favorites concerts of all time. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Oh, this place is terrible! We needed a caffeine fix and a place to rest our tired dogs, so we stopped by this joint. The coffee is not bad, however everything else about this place needs improvement. The tables are so dirty. and a few of them are wobbly too.

 I have tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt several times. The flavor of the food is good, no doubt about that. On 5-23-2013 I ate here with my son once again after approximately a year. They were short staffed, the poor guy who seemed like he was a supervisor was very nice, appologetic and worked as quickly as possible, great job there. Now for the food: WHAT A RIP OFF, they put about a tablespoon worth of chicken in my burrito. I said, ""Could you spare it?' Sarcastically of course, he relented and gave me a little more. I have been in the restaurant business for many years, yes, he is entitled to a profit, however, the cost to put a generous or fair amount of chicken in the burrito is minimal. At $7 a burrito he is making a huge profit with those portions. I don't think I will go back now, I have given them enough chances. For the rest of you suckers, pay attention to what they are doing. The only reason that I gave them two stars is because they do have good tasting food. After reading some, other reviews I wanted to add to it. In one review it was mentioned at how much he was charged for a side of sour cream, once again, they are entitled to a profit, and like myself when they first opened, I used to eat there 2 to 3 times a week and then they nickle and dime you.

 I needed to get some work done on my car recently, and Goodfellas did incredible work on my 2005 Hyundai Accent! I hit a pole a few years ago and decided it was time to get it fixed and have my windows tinted. Not only did Goodfellas replace the fender and repair the bumper, they fixed some dents and scratches on the side of my car, replaced the headlights and 2 axles, and flushed and changed the transmission fluid as well. They went above and beyond my expectations: when I came to pick it up, my car looked absolutely brand new! The entire car was buffed and detailed and the tinted windows looked perfect. For all the hard work they did and extra time spent fixing some major issues they found, they gave me an AMAZING deal, and I am extremely satisfied with my car and experience with them! These guys are friendly, professional, and give excellent customer service. You cannot beat their quality of work and prices; you will not be disappointed! I plan to return again in the future.

 This is my first time staying away from the strip. I was very skeptical when I booked at The Grandview. When I arrived, I was amazed how big the resort is. Nine multi-story building. The Grandview gave me a first great impression before I even walked in my room. As previous reviews have stated, once you check in, the sales staff try and convince you to sign up for a presentation and discounted show tickets for just participating. This is the bread and butter of this type of places so you have to understand how that works. After I politely turned them down, I was not bothered about it again. When we arrived at our room, I was impressed on how nice the room really was. I had a one bedroom with deep jet bathtub in Bldg. 4 and a small kitchenette. The room also had a sofa bed and the bedroom had a very comfortable king bed. Did I mentioned the room had a DEEP jet bathtub (very nice). Yes, it is far from the strip but in my opinion worth the distance. If you want to go to Las Vegas, have fun and more important relax, you can't go wrong with this place. ",0,0,0,0,1

 After walking around, we were pretty hot and tired and decided to try this pub that happened to be nearby. Fortunately, it was happy hour! When Todd's says $3 Sliders, they really mean $3 for one Slider. One...little...burger. What a deal. And, when Todd's says $1 for wings, they really mean $1 for one wing. One...little...wing. What a steal. On a positive note, the beer and wine was 1/2 off. I got drunk on something called ""mead"" and my mom seemed to enjoy her strawberry-whatever beer. In sum, go to Todd's for their selection of alcoholic beverages, but keep in mind that the food is mediocre and overpriced...much like the rest of Las Vegas. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We went to this club on a Saturday night and I thought this place stunk (not literally); it was not worth the $10 cover charge. This is not an ideal place to go if your in your mid-late twenties or younger. The crowd was older (lots of cougars) and it seemed kind of touristy.

 Customer service/friendliness: 5 stars Efficiency/Time of Service: 3 stars Did they fix the problem?: 1-2 stars (??) The Gist: On a Saturday, the brakes on my 2009 Hyundai Genesis lost pressure about 2 blocks from The Brake Shop (TBS). Yelp tells me they're good and close by, so I go. Very nice guys in the front office and they get me right into service. Diagnosis: I'm told that my master brake cylinder needs to be replaced along with several brake pads and rotors. My oil change guys already told me I'd need to replace my brake pads soon, so that made sense. TBS tells me I need my power steering flushed too. I agree to it all. Questionable actions: TBS tells me that the master cylinder will need to be ordered. I decide to wait the extra two days for delivery (they are closed Sunday). On the day of completion, I'm called and told that everything is about 95% complete. Supposedly, my pedal and another system needs to be tuned by the dealership. However, the car is ""still driveable and safe."" I pick up the car and do notice increased pressure but still difficult to drive normally. I call them back to ask what to tell the dealership and TBS tells me that they COULD fix my car completely, but thought I wanted it out early. (huh?) Total amount spent at TBS: $1100.00 Dealership follow-up: My dealership tells me that my entire anti-lock brake system needs to be replaced. Luckily, it's under warranty, but still puts me at an additional weekend using a rental car. I eventually get my car back and my brakes are back to 100% normal. Total amount spent at dealership: $120 (including fully insured car rental for 4 days) Bottom Line: What started off as a seemingly easy repair job became a potential waste of time and money. I don't think I'll ever know if the repair by TBS was really necessary. The guys there were extremely nice and professional and made it look like I was getting a good deal. When I gave my CC over the phone, they stapled that note they took to show they weren't keeping my info. Real integrity or ignorant facade? ",0,1,0,0,0

They said if they found it they would turn it into security. So security didn't have it and my boyfriend called to cancel his card because maybe he though he dropped it somewhere else.

 My first experience with Jean Phiippe was at the Bellagio. Beautiful giant chocolate flowing fountain, and an abundance of variety of sweet treats. What caught my attention was their mini wedding cakes that we considered as an extra novelty gift for some friends of our who are getting married next month. The sell by date was 5/22/14 but the employees stated that they couldn't sell them (which I thought was admirable) but then soon after said that the label was a mistake as they quickly removed all of the packaged mini decorated wedding cakes off of the display shelf. They encouraged us to check out the Aria's Jean Phillipe Patisserie for a possible different variety of mini wedding cakes. NOTE #1 - the JPP retail store at the Bellagio was packed with customers! Arriving at the Aria, I forgot my reading glasses in the room so I needed help in the microscopic labeling on almost all of their packaging - the font is the tiniest that I have ever seen. Our server was Andrea R. Though my wife and I were loading up our arms with products from their counters one at a time, I asked Andrea three different times to read the title only of the unique candies & cookies that I had never seen before. Andrea was getting increasingly bored and annoyed with my desire for CUSTOMER SERVICE so after the 3rd question of mine she literally walked away from my wife and I and walked around to the other side of the store to chit chat with the server who was the crepe maker. NOTE #2 - the JPP at the Aria had zero customers in the retail store side! When Andrea was finally even more bored with her conversation with her counterpart in lackluster customer service (sorry I didn't get her name) she came over and asked if we were ready to pay! I replied with ""No, I'm still trying to figure out what these things are"". And I went all the way around to the complete other side of the almost circle to the only girl of the three who was actually smiling to ask one last question. The complete antithesis to what customer service is - and in a visually nice and hopefully quality tasting store - WHILE THEY HAD NO OTHER CUSTOMERS - and while we spent $129 on gifts!! I so thought of asking for a manager but knew that their couldn't be one managing these three young ladies and hoped and prayed that one of the three of them did not carry that title!

 Best pierogies in tahn! I usually just go with the standard potato and cheese but I've also tried a few of the other pierogies and some of the plus. These pierogies can't be beat. Made by hand with love in the traditional old world style, I have yet to find better. It's amazing to get there at 10:55am, 5 minutes before they open and see the mad rush of people getting pierogies. By 11am, the line is already out the door. Always a good sign. They serve their pierogies hot, cold or frozen. I always go with the hot because nothing beats pierogies bathing in butter and onions. And here at Pierogies Plus, they are definitely worth the wait.

 The staff is is not very professional. While seated on the upper balcony outside we kept noticing the waiters frequently congregating there. It seems they can hide from management there or something. They kept grouping up next to our table complaining about other guests and the other staff. At one point a young guy dressed in a black outfit (busboy maybe) came to our table and put two large dirty dishes from another table on our table. Then he proceeded to talk to us about nothing and interrupted our dinner conversation, while leaving someone else's dirty dishes right next to my girlfriend. It was rather gross to look at someone else's dirty plates while trying to enjoy an expensive meal. Lack of experience maybe? I don't know but unless the service level improves to match the food quality and prices, we will not be back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Hy-Vee is not my go to grocery store, but I do go about once a month. I stopped by under the allure of getting a hot lunch and office snacks in one trip. The location is clean, well kept, busy and things are easy to find. I did a quick walk through the hot food, salad bar, bakery area on my way to get office snacks. I found the snacks (coffee creamer, crackers, peanut butter type stuff) I wanted easily, and got a few impulse buys. Everything was reasonably priced. I then doubled back to get my lunch. I perused the selection and decided to get the Chinese 2 Entree Combo. The woman who helped me was kind, but possibly hard of hearing. I pointed to my first entree selection (Jalapeno Chicken) and she put it on my plate and commented that is was delicious but very spicy, next I pointed to and asked for the Pepper Beef. She nodded and gave me the chicken dish next to it, I saw her dip the spoon and tried to stop her but it was already on my plate. Sigh. Fine, I can eat chicken. I pointed to and asked for an egg roll for my appetizer and she gave me crab rangoon, which I definitely didn't want so I said something. She said it was already on my plate, and they were delicious and stuck the price sticker on my plate and said goodbye. The food itself was warm, fragrant and very delicious. Even the unwanted chicken and crab rangoon. I will be going back to try more hot foods. I decided I needed a dessert, and checked out the bakery. I impulse bought the 7-Layer brownies and the caramel pecan bread. Both turned out to be bad ideas. The brownies ended up being terribly stale and hard. Someone just put old, hard brownies in box and threw them on the shelf. The caramel pecan was a dentist's dream come true! The caramel part was so hard it was painful to eat. Not the firm, sticky good kind of delicious treat. It was a so hard you could crack a tooth or at best pull out a filling. Almost inedible. I ended up throwing both out. If you are going to buy bakery items I suggest asking them how fresh they are or even trying to apply pressure to see how hard or soft the item is. I did not have my Fuel Saver card and asked the cashier to look it up. I know the card is tied to my phone number, as other cashiers have looked it up that way, but she said it wasn't. I will still shop here, but this was an all around bad experience. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I had such a horrible experience with Verizon by phone, I wasn't sure what to expect going to the store that day. I had the most wonderful,through,caring person that works for Verizon EVER, Eric A. He made sure I got everything I needed and most of all he explained everything. Plus he gave me a little instruction on my phone. He also is trying to make himself available for when I bring my mom in to help her change phones! Best Customer Service I have ever received from any place and it was all ERIC!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 We see Dr. Vockley for my son's genetic disorder (VLCADD) in addition to our local geneticist. He's great and the staff at Children's have always been pleasant to work with.

 Finally was flying out of concourse D at LAS and gave it a whirl. Centurion card holder so entrance was free and received a complimentary Johnnie Walker blue label shot. Nice touch. Excellent selection of heavy snacks and seating was great. The only other Centurion lounge I've entered is at the Mexico City airport, which was not nearly as equipped or polished. Over the past five or so years of having a Centurion card, I've watched the cardmember benefits drop year after year while the annual fee has remained the same... so it's encouraging to see AMEX regain focus on cardholders.

 Been coming here for 15 years. Pro's - rolls and sweet breads (have to ask) are fantastic - meals all good portion size and high quality! - atmosphere good on bar side (tv's for games) - atmosphere on other side quiet but very nice - has a couple large rooms for bigger groups Con's - bar side service tends to be slower than expectation; only one server covers that area. So happy this restaurant remains given the market space for dining is so competitive. - ",0,0,0,0,1

 I came here on a recommendation from a friend whose nails looked amazing. I recently found out I am allergic to the primer in acrylic nails. I needed something different. Andy and another technician took the time to help me with my issue. Andy is detail orientated and very nice. I was offered a bottle of water when I walked in. The place was clean and nice. Everyone was friendly and spoke in Vietnamese and in English and did not ignore the customers or talk in Vietnamese in a rude way if they said something to each other they explained what they where talking about. I find that refreshing!! I got a pedicure, manicure and gel nails along with some charms it cost me 72.00 and I was very happy...I will be coming back. I heard it was hard to find a nail place in Vegas well I found one and it was the first recommendation I got!!!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place is oddly frou frou for being right across from a college campus. I've been here twice, once for dinner with my parents and once for drinks and dinner with my BF. Since I'm a big bar food lover, the menu here is too uppity for my tastes. They don't have french fries, but these weird potato balls that are seasoned. I ended up getting the margherita pizza both times, which is big enough to share (it had better be for ~$11). The atmosphere is okay, and sitting outside on a nice day is decent. I'm not a beer drinker but my BF wasn't too impressed with their beer offerings. Overall, a good place to visit during happy hour or later for 1/2 price pizza, but other than that it's too fancy (and expensive) for my tastes as far as food goes. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I absolutely LOVE this place!! I'm so happy that they opened up right in my neighborhood. It's my new go-to place when I want something healthy-ish.

I love how they always give chocolate-dipped strawberries and bread with every order. My only complaint is that they're not open on Sundays!! Boo!!! But whatevs. This place is awesome ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was here a few days ago to buy a book I could not remember the title of. The customer service desk was empty for a long, long time, and when someone finally did come, he didn't look at me and just said ""What do you need?"" instead of any friendly exchange. While I tried to remember the name of the book, he was literally tapping his foot. He couldn't find it and seemed supremely irritated with me that I had the gall to come to a bookstore and ask for help finding a book. When I left and said, ""Don't worry about it,"" he didn't acknowledge me and continued doing what he was doing before. I want to support local business, even if it is a chain, but I came home and ordered the book I wanted from Amazon. ",0,1,0,0,0

Later he comes to us and asked if we had reservation and when we said no he accused us of lying and telling the server that we did?!!!

 My wife and I are craft beer fanatics, so when I heard that this place had over 100 beers on tap I had to try it. While the sheer number of brews was impressive the bartenders knowledge was a disappointment. I don't expect them to know every beer but some basics would have been nice. When I asked the bartender what beers they had on nitro and he replied all of them were on nitro and it was very expensive to serve them that way, I was a little surprised. I should have taken that as hint..... ",0,1,0,0,0

 Service: standard japanese place. Portion: small Quality: cheap fish Taste: too fishy I'm surprise that many sushi restaurants are trying to make profit by cutting corner. Making a good sushi is not all that too difficult. every sushi restaurant are using the same ingridients. Rice, fish and condiments. (Including the rice vinegar, soy sauce, mayo, etc) bottom line is, that there is no secret on making good sushi. its not like trying to cooking french food or some bbq with secret recipes. the bad about this place. The Rice is not properly marinated, The seaweed was very chewy and they are not using fresh fish - or at least, get a good ones. I know its the desert but you can still get a good fish. the food from kitchen is actually not bad (tempura, tonkatsu, udon) overall, if you are looking for good sushi, this isn't the place.

 I am reviewing for takeout that we took to our room. First, I understand the family style approach, but I don't like it for couples. For my husband and I, we would usually each get something different and share. The way the ordering works here, we can't. Lasagna is usually a winner at Italian restaurants, but this was disappointing. The sauce lacked depth and overall, it didn't have the indulgence usually part of the baked pasta experience. The garlic bread was also just mediocre. In the end, I felt like I wasted calories. Not a good thing in Sin City. ",0,1,0,0,0

The pictures he took that day were magical like he really captured picture perfect moments that I truly believe is his special touch that I kept reading about in his reviews. He is the best especially if you are on a budget but want quality results as well.

 I took my 6 year old daughter to a tea ceremony here on a Saturday in March. We met up with 2 other moms + girls from my daughter's school. We had a super time. We were met by our guide/docent who led us along the trails to the tea house. He gave us all kinds of information about the garden, tea and tea ceremonies. When we entered the grounds surrounding the teahouse, we each washed our hands at a traditional fountain. The staff works very hard to make this experience as authentic as possible. Of course, all of the tea ladies wore kimonos. The seating was on stools and there was a table in front of us. We were each served a ""sweet"" and frothy green tea. As the host prepared the tea, another lady stood in the doorway and gave us an explanation of what the host was doing. She also answered questions after the ceremony concluded. What an amazing cultural experience for our girls, and well worth the $25 per person! After the ceremony, the kids enjoyed feeding the koi fish with food bought from the gift store. I highly recommend! ",0,0,0,0,1

 After reading a couple of reviews on Yelp and talking to some friends. I finally had a chance to go to Hikari to check out the all you can eat sushi. It was kinda of a disappointment! The service sucked! I guess I caught them during shift change, but that's no excuse for the crappy service! Seemed like the 2 sushi chef's were pissed off about something and was venting to a server and guests'. When I did place my order, they pretty much forgot what I just told them and just gave me 1 of the 3 different types of sushi I ordered. This happened during the whole 45 mins I was there! Keep in mind it was not that busy! Only about 10 people total in the whole restaurant/sushi bar. On to the food...other than the sweet shrimp sushi, the food was just OK. I tried to order and sample all the offerings that place had, some were, when I got it, OK...some when I got it, were misses! I ordered some uni, it looked like the color was a little off. A friend of mine ordered the deep fried oysters, after waiting for about 10 minutes it finally came out. How painful it is to watch it being served to guest! It looked like they left the oysters in the deep fryer, forgot about it, and then tried to serve it! It looked like a very very deep brown, almost black stones on a plate! What a shame! I think if I had ordered some sake and got drunk...then maybe I would have forgotten about all the negatives. Oh well! Cheers! ",0,1,0,0,0

 The AYCE sushi was a treat today! I went for lunch and was seated right away at the sushi bar. The staff is extremely attentive, my tea didn't run out one time! I ordered a couple of the specialty rolls: Captain's Special and Japanese Lasagna. The Captains Special is one of my new faves, it's covered in the spicy garlic ponzu and the spicy mayo. I had green mussels that were cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed the nigiri sushi I ordered. The pieces were smaller which made it nice for me to try several different kinds. The yellow tail was very fresh! The shrimp tempura was okay...it tasted a bit like onions, which it was fried with. I did find it odd that the shrimp tempura appetizer not only comes with 2 pieces of shrimp but also potatoes, carrots and onions (fillers!) The sushi chef was very friendly and seemed to really enjoy himself. Pumi is one of the less expensive AYCE sushi restaurants, at $20.95 pp for lunch. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I'm all about homemade ice cream and have been to The Perfect Scoop & Boba Tea's two other locations. This particular location warrants a totally different experience although technically the product should be the same. One of the biggest differences is that they sell bulk items of powders, mixes, toppings, straws, etc. It can look rather warehouse-like since it's where they keep inventory. But if you're in the market, then it's a good thing. On our first visit, the restroom was flooded. Sure, that couldn't be helped and maybe a nice sign on the door advising customers that it was out of order would have sufficed. At this particular location, you cannot look into the ice cream case like almost all ice cream stores allow. Therefore, you are basing your decision purely on what's listed on the menu posted rather than what looks visually appealing. (Of course, you can ask for samples too.) However, keep in mind that although it's posted on the menu, you still have to ask if they have it. The menu does not reflect what they currently have in stock. One of the things I enjoyed from their other location was their Green Tea Milkshake. When I attempted to order it from here, they had the green tea ice cream but they were out of soy and almond milk. So, I was stuck with regular milk. (This ultimately meant anyone looking for a vegan milkshake was out of luck.) They were out of a quite of few vegan ice cream flavors too, and I saw a few customers leave once they discovered this. On our second visit, I attempted to call three times to ask about specific flavors before making the drive over. No answer. Were they even open? When we arrived, they were open. I asked the girl working what the phone number was and she had no idea. Then she told me their phone wasn't working either. Okay. (Their credit card machine was down too.) The restroom was working this time, but there was no toilet paper, paper towels, or soap. Not a good sign. The same girl was working and she was by herself again. When she was helping my party, a guy came in and turned on the lights. (Apparently they were off.) He stood by the register and started flipping through the receipt book. I asked if he was the owner and he said he was the partner. There was obviously quite a few customers waiting in line and one would think he'd jump in and help out but this was not the case. When I asked again about soy milk or almond milk, she said they were out. And so I asked about regular milk and she said they were out of that too. (I had watched her make three milkshakes already.) So, what was she using? Half and half. Oh. Hmm...half and half? At this point, I had waited so long for my milkshake I just said okay. Well, it was a mistake. It didn't taste the same and for someone who is lactose intolerant, it sure affected me differently. I won't be having a milkshake made with half & half anytime soon. Other things that could use some serious improvements are how the staff are taught to rinse/wash the items. For example, the ice cream scooper and Vitamix tamper stick were rinsed and she used her hand to 'rub it' under the water. And watching her loose long hair hang over the deep freezer is not a good thing. Rubber floor mats behind the counter are a necessity, especially when you can see how wet the floor is. And ultimately, anyone running a register should know basic addition and subtraction, especially for simple transactions. On both occasions we had to help her with transactions because she entered them into the register incorrectly. I blame the management on the poorly trained staff, the lack of basic supplies, and the lack of teamwork. We were glad to use up the last of our Groupons here because we have no intention of coming back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Excellent service and communication! First off, I would like to say that I.love.IKEA! It has allowed me to spend very little to accomplish my decorating ideals. I live in the SF Bay Area which has not one, but two IKEAs. My local one usually has everything I've wanted in stock, except my white whale - the RASKOG kitchen cart in turquoise. They just don't sell the color and I was told they never will. This item (at the time) was not available online and had no mention if it ever would be, but it was at locations in Connecticut, Southern California and Utah. Since IKEA is staunchly anti-delivery-to-even-another-IKEA-store-so-you-can-pick-it-up-from-there, I was left to turn to a company that specializes in shipping IKEA products to the lower 48. There are quite a few companies that do ship IKEA, but only to limited locales. After hitting paydirt on the IKEAfans website, I found two companies that delivered US-wide: one, based out of Brooklyn that was an absolute nightmare to contact, and ModernLV. Long story short, communicating with Carrie was fantastic (e-mail and text were used). One phone call later, and she very kindly agreed to pick one of the remaining carts up for me from the Costa Mesa (Southern California) location. In the end, after Modern LV's (very reasonable) fees and shipping from Vegas, it came out to a little bit more than it would have been ordering it from IKEA directly, but I did not know if it would ever be available online again and it came packaged extremely well. I love my l'il turquoise cart and am even happier that it came to me via support of an individual-run business. ",0,0,0,0,1

I also ordered a philly cheesesteak sub with extra toppings. The bread was very fresh & delicious. The steak had a peppery taste, which I liked a lot.

 Really nice community gym that's literally 5 minutes away from home. It's got all the basics you need for weight/resistance training: Wide range of dumbbells, bench, and even an Olympic style squat rack. I used to be a member at LVAC but soon left after finding out about Edge. It's a lot cheaper, a lot closer to home, and a lot less packed (last reason being the #1 why I left lvac). My only gripe is that there's no locker rooms. There are lockers, but there is no dedicated room to change outfits. Coming from work or riding my motorcycle here, I bring my gym clothes separately. I'll change in the restroom stall which is inconvenient. Overall, a great gym that's close to home with all the equipment you'll need. I'd rate 3.5 stars but since Yelp goes by whole numbers I'll round up and give Edge a 4/5 ",0,0,0,1,0

 A friend and I redeemed our Groupons and took our two-year-olds, and my almost 8 month old here yesterday for a little fall fun! What a cute place! My daughter absolutely loved the petting zoo. She got up close and personal with some goats, pigs, piglets, and a very friendly donkey! The games set up were cute, but she was a little young for most of them, but we especially loved taking the tractor pulled train out to the pumpkin patch! It was a Thursday over Fall Break and we got there about 9:45. It wasn't crowded at all and everyone who worked there was very friendly and helpful! They offered pony rides for an additional $3 which we skipped this time, but maybe when she's a bit older. We'll definitely be back for their Christmas events. The only reason I gave 4 stars was because admission was the same for children and adults. We had a Groupon so paid $13 for two people, but normal admission is $10 a piece which is pricey especially if you have little ones that can't fully enjoy there is to offer. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Such a cute boutique! Located on the top floor of a small strip mall, this place has a ton of cute finds. They have items ranging from clothing, jewelry, decor, toys, stationary, etc. The prices range from inexpensive to expensive. I picked up a toy for my son and daughter that were very unique and cute. The only annoying thing was that I felt like I was interrupting the employees when I had questions. They were in the middle of wedding planning for the daughter of the owner and were very focused on that. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Of Wolfley and Man! (Metallica Reference!) I came here for lunch with an associate and I wanted to try something new. Wolfley's was definitely something you can't find anywhere in the country so what the hey! I would have ordered their hometown favorite roast beef sandwich, but the waitress warned me it was quite salty. I'm glad she did since I don't take kindly on overly salty foods. So I ordered the cheeseburger sliders instead. Let's just say I wasn't sure if should have sucked it up and tried the roast beef sandwich instead. Sliders were, well sub par and basic. It was pretty dry and it came along with some fried onion flakes. I needed to douse it with some ketchup to help me swallow it. My meal also came along with a side salad, which was probably the better of the two. However, I found a few brown leaves and tried to work around it. Service was good overall and the place was pretty well put together. Definitely a cool place to hang with the boys for a game. I went on Wolfey's website and notice they are fond of charitable work and non-profits coming to their place - Kudos! Then again in my honest opinion I'm not sure I would want to recommend this place unless it's just for drinks. - Enjoy! ",0,1,0,0,0

 To give credit where it's due I shall. The ordering process was easy online but when I selected option to pay driver upon delivery with my card, the driver arrived not knowing this was the option chosen. Disconnect somewhere.

However, I ordered a 16"" gluten free pizza with tomato, pineapple, and jalepe \ u00f1os. It was bland, lacking any kind of flavor.

 Yes, you see that correct. That is a 5 star rating. Is this the best buffet in all of the world? No. Is this the best buffet in all of Las Vegas? No. What it is though, is the best Cheap Eats Chinese-American Food for under $10. With the recent change to management, means completely new everything. New Wait Staff. New Menu. New Prices. New interior decorations. Wait Staff - I am not sad to see the old wait staff gone. Some of the girls were not the most friendly. The new staff seems to much more helpful, attentive and friendlier. New Menu - You still get the basics. However, the food has changed in the flavor. There is definitely more pizazz to some of the food items. At lunch the other day, I had deep fried pork ribs, eggplant, fried tofu, baby bok choy and pad thai. All of it decent and pretty tasty. New Prices - After tax, I paid $8.48 for AYCE lunch buffet. Price increase, but now you get a drink included. Before it was separate price for drink. New Interior Decorations - I posted some pics and it is definitely more easy on the eye on the inside. We went right at 11 am for lunch and they had hot, fresh food out and just kept putting more and more food out. For lunch and the price, they had a pretty good choice. Now, I am not saying that this place is going to make your taste buds slap your mouth. But if you are hungry, in the mood for chinese-american and don't want to spend an arm and leg or want more bang for your buck, then YES this is your place to go. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Oh boy, what a crazy place this is. Large portions, reasonable prices, varying quality, weird staff, dingy place, cheap drinks in the basement. I've heard people rave and dis it - the only thing I have first hand experience with is the chicken tenders. I'm something of a chicken tenders/strips conisseur (sp?). They do homemade chicken strips with a batter that's not too far off from the kind at Chilli's, almost like a tempura type of thing. When they're good, they give esquire a run for best around. Too often though, the tempura-mental batter puffs up like a corndog and soaks up too much grease - my theory is that they just don't keep the oil hot enough. i've basically sworn it off because of this inconsistency. Also, the honey mustard is like some funky yellow mayonaise. Blech! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I finally got my wish to stay at Luxor . I was happy to get a room within the pyramid so that I could see the effect of the slanted windows, another one of those dumb little things I get so excited about. Other than a little water damage around the window, the room was pretty nice. There wasn't much to indicate that Luxor opened way back in 1993. The wardrobe was comically Egyptian themed. I'm impressed with how much is stuffed into the Luxor atrium. The entertainment possibilities are endless. I wish I had the time to visit the Titanic Artifact exhibit. It looked interesting. I liked the color scheme on the casino floor. Creamy white, blue and silver are a great combination and such a difference from many of the other casinos. The elevators at Luxor are almost Wonka-like in that they travel in an angle up and down the corners of the pyramid. Luxor actually calls them inclinators. If you're not expecting the semi-sideways movement, you might find yourself performing and impromptu balancing act. ",0,0,0,1,0

 District One is amazing! I've been twice and about 2 months between visits. I was greeted with a ""Welcome back!"" He said the whole restaurant remembered me because of all silliness my friends and I were having and the jokes I was making. My friends and I were calling it PhOlympics and Phoci. We're full of punny! This unusually cool weather in late May and crazy allergies, Pho is what the doctor ordered. On this visit we ordered Spring Rolls, the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio, and a bowl of the Beef & Flank Pho. I also ordered a Vietnamese Iced Coffee (which is a poor decision on a Wednesday night at 7 PM, I was so jacked) because when in Rome... First out was the Beef Carpaccio, which was a little too salty for my taste, but it was tasty nonetheless. A huge portion and I had a lot of fun eating it with chopsticks. It was peanut, garlicky, citrusy goodness, just tone down the salt! Next up was the Spring Rolls. These were nothing special and were straight to the point. Tasted fresh and the peanut-fish sauce was delicious and fresh. Next up was the Beef & Flank Pho which was delicious. The broth is perfection, top it with some sprouts, jalape \ u00f1os, a squeeze of lime, and sprig of mint. I also add a bit of Sriracha because I like the hot, hot, heat! Seriously, savor the rich complexity of the broth. At this point we were stuffed and happily fed. We were thanked for dining there and happily on our way. District One has a lot of seating, booths and long tables. There's a bar and TVs everywhere. Service is prompt and friendly. Food is fresh and tasty. They also have a bunch of fresh seafood that's delivered daily as well as a Lobster Pho that will happen at the next PhOlympics. Solid Asian Fusion. Definitely a fan! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I wasn't sure I was going to like NOLA initially looking at the menu, but they really surprised me and were fantastic. I myself had the Jambayla and split a flatbread with some friends and would order either again. The service was fantastic as well both as we waited at the bar for a table and during the meal as well.

 I am not so well-informed on the history of Edinburgh's movers and shakers, and I came upon this cemetery by pure accident. It was placid and strangely silent in that way graveyards always are, and I wrote a memorial for a late friend in the snow. I love that you can walk into most of the gravesites, and let the history and age of the place sink in. ",0,0,0,1,0

 If you're looking for a romantic or trendy vibe, this is the perfect spot to be. Foodies rejoice! Le Filet is in an unassuming neighborhood - you would never suspect such a fine dining experience in the middle of what seems like a residential neighborhood. The second we walked in there we were treated like royalty - customer service is sublime here. Maybe because we brought our bachelorette decked out in bachelorette gear, but they were attentive and right on when it comes to making sure we got everything we needed, from bartender and water to plates and timing. Everything here is made to share, and they bring dishes out in waves, replacing your plates and utensils with each wave. It's really fantastic. In addition to a couple bottles of wine and a couple rounds of shots for the 7 of us, all of which were phenomenal, we ordered. The # of asterisks indicates how FANTASTIC the dish was, and how highly I would recommend it. But even the ones without asterisks were great compared to other restaurants, just picking out the ones that really stood out @ Le Filet. First Set: Scallops, Avocado, Beets, Orange Hamachi, Sesame Sauce, Sumac* Tataki of Wagyu, Eggplant, Miso Tuna Tartare, Egg Confit, Nori Tempura** Second Set: Grilled Octopus, Israeli CousCous, Meyer Lemon Coulis Spaghetti, Lobster, Fresh Peas* Arctic Char, Quebec Asparagus, Parmesan Froth* Third Set: Pork Flank, Seared Scallops, Soft Polenta*** Cavatelli, Foie Gras, Veal Cheek**** Lamb Medallions, Tomato Jam, Chanterelles** ",0,0,0,0,1

 The bottle service and hosts here are top notch! A friend referred me to contact a host here for our bachelorette party of 9 and within 30 minutes, we were all set up for VIP treatment and bottle service that night. Once we arrived, we were immediately escorted inside to our booth where the host stayed with us until our server arrived to setup. The consistently checked on us throughout the evening to make sure that we were pleased and enjoying our experience. We were even comped a bottle! I personally didn't pay too much attention to the crowd as we were in our own world in our booth area but the music was the perfect arrangement of hip hop. We were all having a fabulous time dancing and imbibing vodka mixers. Although this club is not as large as Tao, it offers up great service and even better music to get your groove on to. TIP: Ladies generally get in for FREE from 10-11:30 and they can offer complimentary drinks at that time too. I'm not sure what the normal rate is for men to come join. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Went there for the first time with a group of close friends on a random Tuesday evening. It turned out that there was a networking event going on however it was open to everyone. So here's the lowdown: Vibe - clean and trendy without being pretentious Drinks- more than great! The ""mixologist' Tarrence (sp?) did a wonderful job catering to what we wanted and took the time to make it right. I'm talking using real technique to make the drinks like brusing the mint for mojitos rather than muddling View - outstanding. Perfect view of the Charlotte skyline and of the sun setting. Service - Everyone that worked there made sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed. The hookah we ordered was attended to if necessary and also refilled for us. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because this is strictly a drinking establishment. Perhaps small appetizers would have been nice to much on while enjoying our drinks. Overall, I have a new place to take out of town friends besides the Epicentre. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Did the fixed price Palm Italian Menu, and it was great. The Caprese Salad was Epic! The ravioli was very flavorful, and the Tiramisu was, as always, amazing (and HUGE). I suggest trying the Veal Parm, as while the ravioli was good, I saw some of the Veal being served and it looked outstanding. How does the Palm always manage to be packed regardless of the economy, regardless of the time, regardless of the day of the week - or be it Easter weekend? They surely must be doing something right... Bring back the surf and turf special soon, we miss it! ",0,0,0,1,0

 My girlfriend and I decided to have ""tea"" a.k.a. lunch at the Teeter House. First of all, the place could use a refresher or some spring cleaning. It's kinda old and dusty inside. We ordered turkey sandwiches and soup. The soup came out cold and we got the wrong sandwiches sent to our table. No big deal. They fixed the mix up right away. After our sandwiches and cold soup, we still wanted to experience having ""tea"" so we ordered a pot of Earl Gray tea and their dessert sampler to share. The sampler came with small square cheesecakes and cream puffs. The tea was really good but the dessert must had been frozen and then put in the microwave because when we bit into them, the bottom was warm and the inside was frozen. Not the experience I was hoping for going to the Teeter House. On top of it all, the waitress was really loopy. This is probably why the food was wack. I won't be back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Here I was thinking for some bizarre reason that their carne asada would be better than morenos or mi casita in chandler and boy was I wrong. I had come here for (street tacos) carne asada tacos hoping I would find another joyous Mexican place I would be fond of. Their carne asada had a very weird texture or lack of I should say with very little flavor or crispiness in the slightest its almost like they boiled it and threw it on the stove and swished it around til it got hot but not crisp obviously. If their carne asada was amazing id be in heaven with how ginormous the size of those things are. I wish someone would have warned me that they are no where near street taco size they are like street tacos on steroids. I am in love with the usual street tacos because my stomach will only allow a max of 3 in my stomach at a time. The pico de gallo has a lot of minced jalapenos so beware. My spicy tolerance is slowly diminishing where I can no longer handle extreme heat like that. I do happen to like their red sauce though it is spicy enough for me to handle to dip my not as spicy food into to add the heat with each bite. Not much to really say besides I wasted a lot of money for two tacos. So overpriced and the longest wait known to man for 2 tacos. 30 minutes for 2 tacos is crazy. I understand you are busy but 30 minutes really? I doubt ill ever return to this establishment. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Liked this place ALOT. Food was an excellent mix of old and new. Had the late night monte cristo pops which were neat and a good appetizer. Others had the onion ring tower and the sweet potato fries, all good. For dinner we had a wide selection of dishes that all came back with positive reviews. I had the grilled pastrami sandwich with fries, which was good but could have used a mustard as it was a bit dry and lacked a kick. Wife had the coconut shrimp which she enjoyed. Others had the BBQ chicken pizza, fish and chips, blu cheese burger and the pastrami hot dog. The real draw to the place is the beer selection, unbelievable. Ever selection of beer (except my favorite, sours) was well represented. Overall the food was really good, location was awesome, patio was great even on a chilly windy night. The food is really good for the price. ",0,0,0,1,0

 While having a local plumber readily available is great, I am glad to have other options. We were charged for two plumbers (and twice the labor cost) to fix a relatively easy problem, as told to us by other plumbers. Additionally, the finishing touches they did, including calking, were not great quality. I think perhaps they feel like they have a captive audience in the neighborhood. Thankfully, that isn't the case and there are many other plumber options. We've learned our lesson. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Best to know what you're in for before you get here. Located in Henderson, NV, Railroad Pass is about half way between Las Vegas and Hoover Dam. It's a nice stop if you're making that trip. It's a sparse, older crowed. Not a very big casino so, depending on the day and time, you may not find the gaming you are looking for. We go there for the $1 craps tables - typically later in the day as well as weekends. We got on a table around 4 or 5pm on a Friday and mostly had it to ourselves - very excellent! While there, we needed to eat, so we tried the buffet. Not great. Some of the food was okay, but the steaks were below average (thin - not even sure what cut they were). You could order the steak however you wanted (and watch them cook it), but it was pretty much random what you got. Bottom line - don't go there for the ambiance! Go there for the $1 craps and, when you're done, return to where you were at otherwise and have your fun there. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My FIRST Cirque show and I can't wait to see more. This show is super sexual but hilarious. There was great audience interaction but I think I'd be too embarrassed to go on stage. My friends and I really enjoyed the scene with the water tank and also the girl in the school girl outfit and hoops. I especially enjoyed the skits though because they were hilarious. I've heard that Zumanity is super different from the other Cirque shows so if you've seen others, I'm not too sure you would enjoy this one. It was hilarious when the guy pulled out a banana and had a couple take a bite. This is a great show but hard to describe. It's one of those things you have to be there to know about. But if you're not the skittish type when it comes to sexuality and sensualness, you should enjoy the show :] Just go and watch it with an open mind. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I went here twice. First, I came on a Monday night to sample their 50 cent wings (I tried the Hawaiian BBQ sauce). It was good enough, but it tasted a little dry and plain. The french fries, however, were delicious. I ordered them plain and they were incredibly tasty. So I gave it another shot. I came back on a Wednesday because they had a full rack of ribs for half off. Once again, it was good, but it tasted a little dry. So be sure to ask for extra sauce of your choice regardless of what you order. With the extra sauce, the ribs were great, and the price can't be beat. One day I'll actually come back to sample their pizza. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have yet to step foot in this place, however I don't need to in order to rate it. A friend of mine said, ""I am coming up from Tucson and Rudy's is on the way to your house I am bringing breakfast."" OK, well I'm game for anything. He brought the breakfast tacos. First its more like a breakfast burrito its big for a taco. Secondly, it was utterly amazing. Apparently they take the left over brisket and trimmings from the night before, marinate it in BBQ sauce and BAM that's the breakfast taco ingredients. I have been craving another one ever since Friday morning when I had mine. I cannot wait to go try Rudy's for dinner. I have tried Bobby Q's, Famous Daves, Dickey's, and Brian's up in Cave Creek, this was BY FAR the best I have had in the valley!! Highly recommended! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Very crispy thin slices that have terrific toppings. Yes, the pizza is pre-made and on display under glass on the counter (9-10 different varieties at lunch) but they give it a couple of minutes in the oven before they serve it to you. The key to this place I think is to get there when they open or after they start making their dinner pizzas. Fresh and hot is best. I really like this place. Its simple, good and the value is pretty decent for the size of the slice. I really enjoy any of their pesto pizzas and greek pizzas. Very good. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My friend and I Ike to try new places so we checked this one out. The weather was nice and they had the doors open to the patio. The greeter was friendly and the server was attentive. The problem was the food. The French fries were very under cooked and greasy, no salt. The garlic nots were missing garlic and were relatively greasy and under cooked also. The marinara dipping sauce was fairly tasty. My friends Philly cheesesteak was very greasy with very few onions and peppers on it. She did find one mushroom. I ordered the Italian sub with no onions. After picking the onions off my sandwich I found the meats terribly dry and the vinaigrette dressing seemed to be missing until the very last few bite of the first half of the sub where I found the bread soaked in balsamic vinegar. The server apologized and the manager came over and apologized also. He did want to know what the food issues were,, hopefully so he could correct them. Our food was free and he gave us a coupon for future use. I really appreciate his concern and graciousness and I wish him luck in the future but if he doesn't get his kitchen straightened out, I believe his restaurant will be short lived. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'd like to add on something new here to the twenty+ reviews here beyond what you've most likely already learned (Pokey Sticks are a must try for any UofI-an, greasy cheesy goodness, and pizza is just so-so) and tell you a little about this mostly unknown deal that they have called the Gumby's Giveaway. Basically, it's a deal offered 7 days a week that allows you to buy any size pizza or Pokey Sticks and get another pizza or Pokey Sticks of equal/lesser value free. So if you're going to buy from here, make sure you ask about this deal. However, in my experience, a lot of the time, the workers will deny having such a deal or spout some nonsense about it only being on Tuesdays either because they don't want to give it or they don't know about it. Whichever the case, there are coupons for it if you can find one, but the best place to get it at is campusfood.com since it's listed there as an order. Anyway, two for one, Gumby's sounds even better now, doesn't it? However, on the bad side, their pizza is often inconsistent, sometimes having very nice ingredient ratios and other times being too greasy or runny. Pokey's are usually pretty well-made but can be a bit on the doughy side at times. You'll almost definitely want marinara or some other sauce to go with the sticks as they are basically just pizzas with the sauce replaced by seasoning and cheese powder, and you'll need at least two ($0.39 ea) to last you the whole box. Also, Gumby's is notorious for being skimpy with cheese. Yet despite all this, I always find myself going back for more. --- Okay, that's the end of my review. Now it's story time. Back when I was a freshman, a ""friend"" who had been at U of I for a while told me about these amazing things called Pokey sticks. So during the second week or so, I went out with a few other freshman friends on an epic quest for this place. Too bad we didn't realize at the time how ridiculously far out this place is. It took us at least twenty minutes to walk to this place, minus the time we spent in a random (and I think semi-illegal) pet shop filled with aquatic creatures and passing some XXX store (we didn't stop in...but we did make some calls...I won't go into details). Anyways, with sore feet and broken spirits, we trudged into the small, unsanitary place, pooled our random, beginning-of-the-year coupons together, and got two boxes of Pokey's, as well a sodas from their okay-priced vending machine. So we sit down outside (no chairs inside), open the box, and what did we get?? Two boxes of pizza minus the sauce! WTF?? Definitely not what we were expecting. Not to mention that after all that, there was the super long journey back. We didn't have the proper bus knowledge at the time to know which ones to ride back to our dorms, so an overwhelming fear of getting on a bus and ending up in Springfield made us take the same sad trip home, highly disappointed. Totally breaking the pacing of the story, we eventually learned to love the taste of Gumby's. Maybe it's something they put into the seasoning... ",0,0,0,1,0

 Me and my bf had eaten here once before about a yr ago, and we totally loved the experience. So much so, we decided to invite my family to capos for dinner the other day, thinking it would be a pleasant change from the olive garden. Boy, were we wrong. First off, the restaurant was DARK. I remember it being dimly lit the last time we had dinner there, but not like that. I couldn't even see the faces of the people surrounding me, much less my food. Im not one to complain too much about the ambiance, but I know something is wrong when I walk out of there with tired, strained eyes. Plus, I think there was an alterior motive for this dark lighting, aside from an energy savings technique (more on this later). The service was crappy, or should i say our waitress was. She didn't know most of the plates offered on the menu, and she was spastic and disconnected. We all asked for water with no ice, but they gave us the opposite. And we asked for a couple of extra things, like olive oil for bread, but they never made it to our table. The food was... so-so. Some dishes were overly spiced. Parents shrimp scampi had 6 shrimps each, tops. Lasagna was okay. Overall it was decent, but the first time we went there, the food was way better. Or maybe it seemed that way because we had a better experience. Or maybe seeing your food is part of the experience of enjoying it, and if you can't see it, you can't enjoy it. Lastly, but most importantly, we are certain that they *OVERCHARGED* us. The bill came close to 300 (not including the tip we gave), and altho we thought it was too much, we didn't fight it because we were with my parents (don't wanna look bad) and we couldn't even read the bill. (again, the lighting issue... maybe that's why they keep it so dark in there.) After tallying up the score at home, we realize that they most likely charged us an 18 to 20 percent gratuity (for a group of 6? Really?) and didn't tell us. (Lucky them, they got two tips). But that still doesn't account for the total amount that they charged us, so we think that they probably charged us an extra plate as well. We will never know, because we never saw the receipt properly at the restaurant (try reading a note hand written in pencil in the darkest corner you can manage, and that was our situation) and they didn't give us a receipt to take home. So in short, poor lighting, bad service, and ridiculous pricing/charging methods will keep us away. The food definitely isn't worth it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 OK, I'm a total cornball, but I loved every second of this ride.

He told us to kiss for luck when we went under the bridges and I loved it! My bf just did it for me. I don't think he liked it nearly as much as I did but it was great that he went along. They took our pics when we got on and floated away, which we got to buy and now I have one sitting on my desk to remind me of our little ""trip"" and it makes me smile when I look at it. This is definitely corny, but totally worth it! A must try when in Vegas. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Tips N Toes Rocks. First class service. I recommend: (1) calling ahead to inquire about pricing, (2) making an appointment. The services are worth every penny. Comments on G.M.'s review below: a 15 min wait time is reasonable....complaining about having to wait, then complaining about being 'rushed through' - I doubt GM is easy to satisfy no matter what the situation. Prices are reasonable for a salon of this caliber. The Tips N Toes is busy.....because they are one of the best spas around. No loss if GM never returns.........less waiting for the rest of us! I recommend: (1) calling ahead to inquire about pricing, (2) making an appointment. The services are worth every penny. Also, if a customer show appreciation and treats Tips N Toes owners and employees kindly......they will definitley be given the queens/kings treatment! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I came in for an underarm wax because I was going on vacation and didn't want to be bothered with shaving. I must say I was very nervous and a little hesitant because no one I knew had ever had this done before (and I asked EVERYONE). I called ahead to make sure they offered the service and the man told me they closed at 7 but I could come anyway (it was 6:45). When I got there I waited about 10 minutes as everyone was still working on someone else. The waxing is done in a separate room and is kept clean. The actual waxing for each arm was done about 5 or so times to make sure all of the hair was gone. It was actually pretty painless- it hurt less than my eyebrows which I have done regularly. The after effects weren't too bad and I felt back to normal within a day or two. I remained hair free for about 5 days but after that I did need to do some touch up shaving, which I blame on myself because I only let my hair grow for about 4 days before getting waxed. Ideally, I should have waited about a week. The outside is a little run-down but the inside is very serene and peaceful, which is something I want during my mani-pedi time. Staff was very friendly and happy to oblige. Wait time didn't seem too bad but they definitely seem to be busy after 5 and on the weekends. I only gave 4 stars because I haven't had their primary services- nails- but because of my great experience with waxing, I will definitely be back to try out their feet and hand services. :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 I am lovin the ambiance of this lounge! As soon as you step inside you forget that you are in Downtown Phoenix. It's kind of dark and has a bit of a vintage feel to it. I met some friends here after work for an art show and had a great time. This is a great place to go to on a date or to grab some drinks with friends. I ordered the strawberry pecan salad and it was just ok the chicken was bland and the lettuce was a notch under being fresh. I had a glass of their house white wine and enjoyed chatting it up with my friends and checking out the art and live performances. I give it 3 stars for ambiance and 1 star for the food, I'm sure I'll be back and give the food another try! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Part of my Vegas routine is to head to this little strip mall on the corner of Tropicana and Decatur, grab a coffee at Starbucks, work out at the 24 Hour Fitness (I'm not about to pay $20 to use my strip hotel's ""spa""!), and then go to Sushi 21 for a post-workout meal. While this isn't the best sushi around, it is still of good quality and reasonably priced, and I've yet to have a disappointing meal. I normally get either the chirashi sushi or its Korean equivalent, hye dup bap (I believe this place is Korean owned and operated), each of which is a great deal for around $12 (though they charge an extra $2.50 for miso soup, which typically comes with chirashi at most places).

 I think this should be more like 1.5 stars. I got a 6-pack of tamales. They were more expensive than I would've guessed (I sort of had to, considering they weren't priced). First I open the package and low-and-behold this bag of six tamales, in fact, contains only five! The filling is fine, but the masa blows. It is dry and gritty. The preparation instructions seem questionable (microwave in a plastic bag? Really?). I'm saving the remaining ones for when I'm too drunk to care about anything. The tortillas are still worth it.

 Ok, I've been on Yelp since 2006, my one only review was in 2009, and this is the first one since so will make this a good one. This is our second time eating at Shibuya with our girls (age 19, 14). We wanted to go to L' Atelier or Craftsteak but could not get a reservation so we ended up here. Our first time was in Jan. 2007 and ordered from the traditional menu. Don't remember much from that meal but I know it was quite good. This time we had Teppanyaki. Didn't have any expectations but we were blown away. By far the best Teppanyaki we've ever had. However, if you're looking for one with a Teppanyaki show (such as that at Benihana's), this is definitely not the place. Our dinner: an amuse bouche (crab salad), the organic field greens w/ apple yuzu vinaigrette, soup (lobster and mushroom miso) main course ( Day Boat Scallops, Salmon-Sustainable Catch, Ribeye, Tenderloin) with dipping sauces trio (ponzu, ginge miso, garlic aioli), Organic Vegetables and Tamaki Rice. Everything was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. We ended the meal with a dessert trio of mango mochi ice cream, choco lychee mouse and panna cotta w/ raspberry coulis. Loved it! They have an extensive sake and cocktail list but we're too tired from our day trip to the Grand Canyon so we didn't have any. From the beautiful setting to great food, I would recommend this restaurant. However, I only gave it 4 stars because we weren't too crazy about the service. The Hostess were friendly, the Teppanyaki Chef was good, but our main server was abrupt. I even asked if we can order some items from the traditional menu and he quickly replied no, but we saw the lady at the next table who clearly was eating something off the regular menu. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Although the food was delicious, the prices were unnecessarily high and our server was incredibly rude. My friends and I asked for a check split among 4 and our server informed us that they don't do that...they'll do it, but they don't typically. She proceeded to tell us three more times between our request of the bill and her returning them with our credit cards. I've worked in the service industry before and I know that it's a bit of a hassle to split checks once they have been made out, but it isn't hard and when I'm paying $16 for chicken wings I expect the server to be extra accommodating. My friends' $21 Chinese Chicken Salad was very similar to a chain restaurant salad (Cheesecake Factory came to mind). The highlight was the chicken wings, which were crispy and the drier sauce made for a delightful late night snack. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I definitely enjoyed my experience at ONoir, but i'd probably recommend going only once. If you've made a reservation, you're coming for the experience, not the food. I had the eggplant appetizer and Marinaded Shrimp. The quality of the food was very average. The eggplant was soggy and small portioned. The shrimp was delicious, but the accompanying rice and vegetables were over sauced and overcooked. However, the ambiance was great. There was a live jazz band playing behind us, which complimented the mainly French speaking diners who were enjoying their meals. Again, a memorable experience. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Checked them out on a Friday evening for dinner. The interior is bright and friendly. The service is good. We ordered a Pizza Mac with Dorito flakes, a Chili Mac with Corn Tortilla flakes and a Tuna Melt with Sweet Potato Chips. Basically, too much food for two people. Both of the macs were very tasty. The Pizza Mac had pepperoni slices and a garlic flavor. Yum. The Chili Mac had chili. Yum. The melt was the least cheesy of the three, but was quite good too. It had lots of salady stuff in it to make you feel better about what you were eating. In short, it felt like one of the regular-sized macs, due to their heavy cheeseness, could do an adequate job of filling two stomachs, if, perhaps, supplemented by a sandwich. Eating a the whole Chili Mac myself left me feeling like I had swallowed a delicious cheese brick. We would go back to try out the wide variety of other foods they have there. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Sick of dive bars that are just hipster code for dark and expensive with a dart board, well people need to take notice of Stage Door, which may very well be the crappiest bar I've ever had the privilege of drinking at. And I loved it. The vibe makes you feel like you're drinking in the convenience store at a gas station, coupled with some losers wasting away at video poker at the bar. But that's ok, they can afford it considering how cheap this place is! Vegas may be one giant rip off, but for at least the next 21 years, Stage Door will be there to make sure you can get full on drunk for cheaper than the price of one drink at the nearest casino bar. Well... maybe not quite... especially considering that this might be the first dive I've ever been to where my BOTTLED beer tastes watered down.

 This was the first time I'd been to Wrigley Mansion while it was open. I had a ""private tour"" by an employee once and got to see everything and it really is a great place. Went for a birthday party and we had dinner. $5 for valet parking, which is really reasonable, I think. Especially in heels, cuz this girl ain't walkin' up them thar stairs. We had a private dining room, about 25 or so of us. Wait staff did an awesome job dealing with such a huge party and handling our bill. If it weren't for the food and price, I would have given this place 5 stars. I started with the leek tart, which was amazing and a great portion size for an appetizer. Next, had the Tuna Nicoise salad. This is where they lose a star, and it wasn't just me voicing a problem with the size of the portion. There was definitely plenty of tuna on it, but as Erin said ""You'd think they would have put more of the cheap stuff on it"" meaning there wasn't a whole lot of salad. And the roasted potatoes that came with it? I had two cubes of HARD potatoes. They were barely cooked. The tuna was perfectly seared on the outside and still nicely red on the inside. If it weren't for that, I would have been horribly disappointed. $43 for an appetizer, a salad and a bottle of Pellegrino. (That included the gratuity added for such a large group). Wrigley is all about the ambiance and view, and it surpasses what you could describe it to be. Seeing the city at night and being surrounded by cool peeps is what really made the place! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I get the hype and the love! it's a fun club! Went here last weekend, and Sidney Samson did his set. Was impressed with the overall layout (so much room to roam and partying under the night sky was *love*), there wasn't really a dance floor perse but I guess the area closest to the dj was considered it. Anywho, I think my shout outs go to the bartenders from AZ who were so creative with their drink concoctions, it was nice to enjoy some Phoenix creativity which is something I gotta say for Phoenix bartenders they know their drinks =) Anywho, I just loved the overall vibe and my drunkenness helped make my night better, the vegas priced drinks didn't even faze me. lol.

 Having now tried all three of Phoenix upscale Hamburger Emporiums, unfortunately Zinburger is my least favorite. The quality of the burger seemed fine, although for $10, fine doesn't seem to be enough. The regular French Fries were nice and crisp. The taste of the Burger doesn't come close to The Grind which I rate to be #1, followed closely by Deluxe. There wasn't that beefy goodness and charbroiled taste to this burger I wanted to like this expensive burger as the location is terrific and the service, even on a slow afternoon, was quite wonderful. Unfortunately, it neither lived up to expectations or to its competitiors. If I am going to ""splurge"" on a Burger it is going to have to be The Grind or Delux ""after hours."" ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is great. Old-school New Yorky decore and delicious pizza. Cool indoor/outdoor bar and seating. The pizza is thin crust and not as cheesy or greasy as your typical pie. So, keep that in mind if that's what you like. In my opinion, this is just as tasty without being a gut-buster. The menu is limited to pizza, calzones, apps/salads/sides, dessert and drinks so be prepared for that. As in, if you want pasta you're going to be disappointed as hell.

 Stayed here two months ago on a get away for my anniversary. My boyfriend and I are not super big partiers but figured an affordable vacation to Vegas to see some shows and have fun was in order. We got to the hotel and it wasn't too far off of the strip which was great. Our room was decent. But we had the strangest thing happen, and were not happy with how it was handled. We picked up some things to drink on the way to the hotel. There's a key to lock your fridge, which we had a bottle of vodka in and some beers and we didn't lock it. We came back to the room on our second day there, after only having two or three drinks out of the bottle, we opened up the fridge to find that it was almost empty. This was after our room had been cleaned. It wasn't like this was expensive alcohol but we decided to let the front desk know. You would think they would want to know if someone that works for them may be drinking on the job or taking anything in general. After we let them know the next time we opened the fridge on the next day (also after housekeeping had come) we noticed the vodka all of a sudden had doubled. We let them know it had been tampered with again and then they sent up a security person to our room. Now, I can understand that 99.9% of the time people probably drink it and forget and complain because it's Vegas...and that happens. But that was not the case, I was that .1%. The response we got from the security guy is that we had drank the alcohol and we just forgot, and he said that multiple times. I did NOT appreciate that. It may be silly but that's telling me I'm a liar. We were not asking for anything free, and I am still un-amused by that response. They offered us a free breakfast after we first had mentioned it to them which was lovely...until we got back later in the day and they had messed with it again. Had we even the littlest doubt that we may have drank it we would not have been complaining. Maybe you have a housekeeper that likes to drink on the job...ever think about that? Won't be back. All it took was an interest in the issue we were having and not telling us it was our fault and it would've been just fine. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Great decor for the theme--spiderwebs, some shorts in beakers, random scientific looking stuff--and also great music for the theme--'its back from the dead: 80s music'. Not sure if they always play music by the decade, but they should. You would need to be in a certain mood to go there there though--not your average night out--and, because of the decor, I felt like I should have dressed up more. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I pass this pub daily. Usually dodging around the persistent small gathering of tourists gathered around the Greyfriar's Bobby statue. I imagine this bar often gets a lot of passing trade from said tourists, and locals alike. The bar has recently been renovated inside, and the result is a very homely, traditional Scottish pub feel inside. It reminded me immediately of the local village Smiddy pub that my family took me to every Sunday for lunch or dinner (the type that did pate, steak sandwiches, death-by-chocolate cake. That was my order for a good 12 years). Anyway, I digress. What I mean is, it's homely, it's inviting and not only is it homely, it feels like home. A magic wee trick, where it will both appeal to tourists looking for something very Scottish-y but isn't OTT or a faux-Scottish feel, and instead recreates the cosy Scottish pubs of old. There is a very large dining area, for a bar. The bar area itself is quite small and I can imagine would get crowded if many people tried to stay here all at once. So I can imagine they'll be looking more for families for dinner, and larger groups, than a large group of mates all meeting for a pint. But that's just fine. The food menu itself is extensive, and I was immediately intrigued by a Crabbie's Ginger Ale glaze on the chicken. Served with a good helping of skins-still-on chips, it was hearty and filling and good, honest, pub fare. The Thai green curry looked delicious, and I heard the prawn and chorizo salad was very spicy (if a little on the small side compared to the other mains). If I had my family visiting and in need of a good pub lunch, I wouldn't hesitate to bring them to Greyfriar's. Definitely not a 'tourist trap' or selling out, they've recreated a genuine little pocked of a quieter Scottish lifestyle. ",0,0,0,1,0

 A great new addition to the DeMarco family of ventures. This was a pre-opening tasting, so they're still working on all of the fine points. Nonetheless, it is a terrific spot. The structure itself is very appealing, as they restored a 1940's-era building and exposed its beautiful brickwork, which is complimented with a stained concrete floor. The bar is a proper one with a wide array of liquors and fairly ample seating for the size of the space. The patio definitely will be the preferred seating choice so long as the weather cooperates. We tried macaroni and cheese as well as the cole slaw starters; for $3 each, you could make a delicious, reasonably-priced meal from a collection of the starters. The double dip starter (cobb dip and posole salsa with chips) was very good, though I almost preferred the dip and salsa without the chips because they're so flavorful. The mixed grain salad was a good choice, too, though I might try to find something other than the orange vinagrette to put on it. The wine on tap was tasty, and they'll also have a small list of about 8 bottles. Again, the official opening isn't until the 25th, so they're still honing the fine edges. In any event, we'll be there far too often for our own good! ",0,0,0,1,0

 ended up here during that awkward period between lunch and dinner (approx 2pm) totally famished. happy to have a server w a beer suggestion (40 options) at the ready, so my expectations steadily grew as we ordered (me: beef brisket sammie, hubs: pulled pork entree w mac&cheese and fries). being a southern transplant, i give northerners a large amount of leeway in recreating ""exotic"" foods i grew up eating, but even so, brickhouse bbq is nothing exceptional. menu in general is lacking any real chefs vision or influence but theyve rejected basic bar food ""specialties"" (no cheese curds, but they do have hush puppies...odd to me). ultimately, i wouldnt come back for the food, and the beer i had was the most expensive, least special IPA i have ever had. letdown.

 Buffalo Wild Wings is hit or miss with service and overpriced for what you get. The service is sometimes ok, others it is miserable. We went back after it had re-opened in Surprise. The wings were absolutely delicious-- they were meaty, perfectly cooked with the right amount of sauce. Unfortunately, the next time we went in, the wings were very much like the BWW of old. Small wings, overdone and completely drenched in sauce. What makes it worse is the fact that, with the family-- there are fours of us-- it costs over $60(with tip-- provided the service is on par for a tip). And now I hear that BWW is reducing(??) its portion sizes but nor reducing the cost?!?!? see this link for the new portioning: http://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/controlling-costs/food-cost-outlook/articles/bww-adjusts-portioning-policy-reflect-wing-costs and this link for the price increases: http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/28/investing/buffalo-wild-wings-earnings-higher-prices/ ",0,1,0,0,0

The cash register was out of pennies, and the woman working the till had no records but to round down when giving change, lest she chime up short at the end of her shift. The rest of the pennies were ostensibly stowed safely in the time-lock safe, which is only a minute oversight, but far from the only one. Fountain drinks are eighty-none cents for a small. I thought it wise to mention that here, because that information is curiously absent from the store itself. In fact, all the prices are missing from the soda fountain. And the cold sandwiches. And the burritos. And the string cheese. In fact, the hot dog roller was the only thing in the wee deli area that said anything useful. There were many places where it looked like price tags had been affixed and later removed, which was only more disconcerting. I can see the wisdom in removing or amending indirect information, but not in wholly dissociating their displays from posted valuation. I thought of buying a sandwich or burrito, but decided not to because I shouldn't have to price check things just to know whether I should have cash or my card ready at the checkout counter WHERE THEY WOULD CHECK THE PRICE. I opted for a Little Debbie snack, because the price is already printed on the package when it arrives at the store. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Dunkin Donuts are terrible. If you got to have your sugar fix, go to Starbucks. Better quality sugar items. In college Dunkin donuts were good because you had a hangover and anything tasted good. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I only came here for the pool. I was watching a show about the world's most fabulous pools, and the Golden Nugget's pool was featured. I am obsessed with sharks and aquariums, so I absolutely had to go see their pool with the shark tank in it! The rooms were pretty spacious, a lot bigger than a room on the strip would be, but the bathroom was so tiny!! I never realized how run-down Fremont street was. The Nug was definitely the best looking hotel down there. But back to the pool story: It was not worth it. We went down before the pool opened to save a lounge chair, but they were all gone. EVERY SINGLE ONE. Finally we had to put our stuff by a planter. The pool was really small and there were small children everywhere!! What I was stoked for was the slide, but it was super disappointing as well. It went so fast and the area with the sharks was so small that all you saw was a one second white light and it was over. Lame. We packed our stuff and got the heck out of the Nugg. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Fantastic food. Our party of three tried a variety of things, and every... single... thing was delicious. I liked the aesthetic of the place, and the music was of the appropriate volume, and of pretty good selection. Only two things were negatives: Price - a little higher than I would have expected, and deserts - really just odd, but not mind blowing. That said, I'll definitely go back, as I think they might be my new favorite. ",0,0,0,0,1

 It was OK. Here are my problems. Fuego sauce....said it was extra hot, however, extra hot? Nope. Fires out fellas. Pace picante hot was HOTTER by far. The medium salsa was mild.....enuff said. The pork tamales were without pork. I think the cashier meant to say that the pork was in the green chile sauce but the sauce itself didn't have any pork in it as well. My quesadilla had sour cream and guacamole on the inside when it was toasted. Nothing like warm sour cream to soften the taste buds. Chicken on the inside was flavorless...flavorless the green Chile that was supposed to be inside the quesadilla was thin to say the least. Tortilla was good however and the service was friendly. Overall, we will not be back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My favorite family Chinese in Pittsburgh! Best Won ton soup, egg rolls and fried rice (darkened by soy sauce). Lomein , Moo Gu gi pan yummy! Service is the best part Kitty with her husband Kwan are the owners and Chief cooks and bottle washers. They do it all and do it well. Cash only but you don't need much prices are very cheap.

 Read about this place on Yelp Monday and dropped by the next day to try it out! The baos were delicious, tender in the dough and crispy in the skin (for those of you who avoid the skins for health reasons, they only put one piece of it on there to give the bao some crunchiness). More meat was in the chicken than the duck, but both were fantastic and well worth the wait! The seasoning isn't overpowering and all the ingredients complement each other (I especially enjoyed the cilantro). As I found out first hand in person as well as on Yelp, you are discouraged from taking your food to go unless you live close by to the establishment. At first I asked to take it to go because it seemed like there was no where to sit, but Jenny talked me into sitting at the bar. I wasn't in a hurry to go anywhere and I figured, why not. The food is less likely to get soggy and it won't be necessary to reheat it. I highly recommend ordering the combao- trust me you won't regret it! Because if you order just one, you'll be like me and wish you had ordered it upfront. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I came her with some friends to see the band SOJA. this is one of my favorite venues to see a live show anywhere! The inside has multiple levels and there is not a bad place anywhere - standing room only unless you get there early enough to grab one of the few bar tables and stools. The bar is large and can handle many people wanting drinks at one time. You get the feeling that you are on top of the bands when they are playing - a great intimate experience and makes you feel like they are playing at your house. Tip the bartenders well and they remember your drink orders, so by the time I bellied up about the 3rd or 4th time - my drinks were placed in front of me in what seemed like 10 seconds or less! The free self serve water next to the bar is a nice touch too. The bathrooms are large and nicely located. I have been to many shows here - thanks to the Visualite for getting this small place right!

 So this recent trip took off one star for me. The sangria was like kool-aid, the guac had zero flavor and hostess got mad when we wanted to choose our own table near the window after discovering it was too windy to enjoy the patio. When you choose to spend money and calories on a dinner out- you don't want it to be a MEH experience. I think they rely heavily on the location, out of towners and people who don't know what Mexican food should be like. Oh the plus side: Our server was nice. The plantains were good. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Ordered couple appetizers to start, the popcorn chicken, or salt and crispy chicken and pork steamed Dumpling. The chicken was ok, had better.. and the pork steamed Dumpling was the same you buy from 168 Market. For the entr \ u00e9e we ordered a beef stewed noodle soup and salted fish with chicken and eggplant. For this dish the fish needs to be salty! No flavor from the fish at all.. Overall plain taste. Noodle soup was ok. The beef was very tender but the soup stock taste almost like instant or stock powder. Little to say we were disappointed. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Above average ambiance. Maybe slightly better than average food. I didn't feel the prices were in line for an off strip joint. Service we got there was slow. Took about 2 hours to get in and out from putting our names down to getting sandwiches and omelets during a weekday. It was pretty much the only full restaurant open in the place for lunch when they have like 5 of them. Cutting service so much won't get more people into your casino. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My husband and I live pretty close by and decided to try this place out. The sandwiches and pastas sounded good and they serve breakfast all day...sounded promising at first! Who doesn't love breakfast food at dinner?! Well...then we looked at the prices. Holy smokes. These portions better be good. I ordered a breakfast burrito and paid an additional $1.50 to add bacon. My husband ordered a BBQ bacon burger with onion rings and we split a small soda. Total came to about $22. Whoa...we could have eaten at a sit down restaurant for that price. : \ \ We then proceeded to wait for 20 minutes or so. It seemed to take forever. When we finally got our food, we were a bit disappointed to see the portions. My husband got literally 4 onion rings on the side and I expected my burrito to be a lot larger for nearly $10. My breakfast burrito was just ok taste-wise. I didn't like how it was pretty much all egg with hardly any salsa and I could barely taste the cheese. For some reason the avocado wasn't spread out evenly throughout the burrito, just a big chunk of avocado on the end of the burrito. They need to distribute the ingredients more evenly to balance out the tastes. The part that really ticked me off was the bacon I paid an additional $1.50 for...The bacon was just tiny little chunks sprinkled throughout the egg and there was hardly any of it! Seriously? I paid extra for this?! I couldn't even taste the bacon in it so I feel it was a total waste to get it. Extremely disappointing and a total rip-off. Overall, the place is just way too overpriced for average food. We probably won't be coming back here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I visited during the soft opening and opted for pre-theatre, which at only \ u00a316.50 for two courses or \ u00a319.50 for 3 - including steak - is a good deal. The chips were particularly good, and I enjoyed the steak too (sirloin with pre-theatre, although your server does show you a platter of all the cuts before you order which is a nice touch). Service was good, a little ropey but the restaurant had only opened the day before and they were very friendly, rectifying the mistake with our bill straight away. The decor's trendy and smart too.

 THE BEST BUFFETT IN VEGAS. 5 star BUFFETT, 5 STAR QUALITY, even 5 star rice! I've been to vegas 5 times in the last 3 years and I do go to wynn at least 2 times per visit! sometimes me and my bf want to take a day trip just to eat there!! haha Heres a few tips (get arnold ice tea) -Sushi! I love how they put real crab in their california roll. I actually see them picking the crab meat out of the crab. Also get the spicy salmon handroll. -prime rib!! or any of their meats that they offer! make sure to get creamy horseradish try everything!! they have a huge selection! Desserts!!!! Creme brulee is the BEST I tried in my lifetime!!! Everything is good.. If you want to cheat the system and pay less you can do this. I am not a scammer, but one time me and my bf ate during breakfast around 10:30. breakfast food is good!!! but of course you at least stay there for an hour....then the LUNCH food comes and you are still there!! and you paid BREAKFAST price..

 Yay for Yelp! Was looking for a reasonably priced non-chain and Yelp told me to go here. I did what most of you suggested and got the simple lam gyro and lemon oregano fries combo. About $10 for the combo, which was a little more than I wanted to spend, but it was delicious. The tzatziki sauce with the fries were SO GOOD. Definitely homemade sauce. The gyro tasted really fresh and the lamb was obviously cooked fresh too. I personally like a little feta on my gyro, but that's alright...it may not be traditional Greek to have feta.

 Seablue was really a treat, thank you yelp for helping me find it. The ambience is tranquil and sleek with illuminated cascading water fountains that make up the perimeter. We decided to a series of small plates (appetizers) instead of the entrees which are a bit more traditional in selection. The meal began with seasoned crisps and a trio of creamy feta, red pepper dip and hummus. The caesar was good, the soft shell crab was more of a salad taster (a lot going on); but my favorites were the stuffed prawns and the lobster puff. Finally the freshly made mini chocolate bon bons were to die for! 4 appetizers and 1 glass of wine came to $100 after tax and tip. Not bad for the strip and an excellent dining experience.

 I was looking forward to eating at Chop Chop because of the rave review my friends gave it (to me) 7 weeks ago. I booked to eat on a Thursday night, as it was my last night in Edinburgh and i decided to treat myself. What a Disappointment! When i arrived the restaurant was empty, apart from the 4 waiting staff. When i was seated at my table i discovered that the plates were made of plastic. Really not what i was expecting at all. I started off by ordering 16 boiled Pork and Coriander dumplings with 8 Chicken Fried dumpling. I also had a Chicken Chow Mian and deep fried aubergines. The Pork and Coriander dumplings were very bland, which I'm guessing is why you have soy sauce and vinegar on your table, there was no taste what so ever. The fried chicken dumplings tasted better, I could actually taste the chicken. The Chow Mien, again was very bland and the chicken was like rubber. I had to resort to pouring my dumpling dipping sauce over the Chow Mian to give it some flavour. plus, the portion of Chow Mian is huge for one person, I couldn't finish it as there was so much. Lastly, the Aubergines. They were absolutely disgusting. Completely soaked in oil, so much so I could not taste the spring onion and garlic that the aubergines I paid \ u00a330 for all this and a small bottle of spring water, not the great value i was told about. Their website states that they make their own noodle and dumplings, in fact the dumplings are not made in the restaurant, but in a custom built factory in Edinburgh's suburbs. The staff are the only reason why I am not giving Chop Chop 1 star, they were great. Very friendly and helpful. So all in all, a grand disappointment. It does seem that the owners have spent so much time and effort with the new restaurant in Leith that they have all but forgotten the original Haymarket restaurant. ",0,1,0,0,0

As a daily wine person, that's huge. Also, the Big Day White with a picture of a walking pancake on it is the best white I have had in quite a while.

 Pass up on reading the reviews folks. Check out a few photos and you'll end up bookmarking this place. I've had this place bookmarked for one reason...BOBA!!! I just wasn't going to drive out of my way to get it. Well, tonight worked out perfectly since I was across the street having dinner with Terri R. Terri brought this place up, pulled up a few photos from other Yelpers, and I was sold. One issue though, everything that looked really good had fruit in it and I can't eat fruit. So, plan B (i.e. Plan Boba) was in effect. We were too lazy to use the crosswalk or get in our cars, so we played a little Frogger by jaywalking and dodging a few cars. We got to Icy Juicy in one piece. Even better, I'm considering this my cardio for the night. Icy Juicy is a small restaurant that serves a plethora of treats from snow ice, boba, yogurts and a bunch of fruit creations that is best described through pictures. Everything looked and sounded good. I opted for the Cappuccino Slush w/Double Boba. My drink was delicious and cold like it's suppose to be. My favorite part was the warm boba with each slurp. Looking forward to taking the family here when they're in town. Next time I'm here, I'm trying their Monster Toast minus the fruits. TIP: You can't go wrong with the food, but service was just okay. We waited and waited for our check. After reviewing a few other reviews, this looks like a common theme. ",0,0,0,1,0

 On 2/2/10, My party of three came to Champion Gourmet for the hot-pot. We found it disappointing. The atmosphere sucked. The place was cluttered and run-down, with a television blaring Chinese language soap operas at full volume for the entire meal. We had to get our own water from a water cooler with dinky Styrofoam cups. We experienced a severe language barrier with the wait staff, which in of itself is not a deal-breaker, but in conjunction with everything else, made the bitter icing on an already crappy cake. Our hot pot took a long time to come to the table. We ordered the spicy broth, with lamb as our main protein. A plate of enoki mushrooms, squash, corn on the cob, cabbage, zucchini, tofu, and noodles was included with the lamb, gratis. We also ordered some shrimp dumplings, clams, and squid balls. The lamb was great - no complaints there. The veggies were fine, too, and the squash was surprisingly delicious. However, the shrimp dumplings were truly disgusting. They tasted - and smelled - like low tide. Oh my word, were they fishy and briny! They stank up all our soup! They tasted so amazingly bad, I couldn't determine if that was their intended flavor, or if they'd simply gone rancid. And the clams were no better. I couldn't believe how rank they were. The squid balls kept me from losing all faith in this place's seafood. They were chewy and mild, with a slightly sweet flavor. Even though the wait staff was sitting in the same room as our party, they were too busy watching the TV to attend to us whatsoever. I had to walk up to one of them and physically tap her on the shoulder to get her to take our second order (more lamb, and more noodles). I was afraid that we might get food poisoning from the seafood, but my friends and I seemed fine all evening. I've had better hot-pot at a Chinese buffet in Saint Louis, Missouri. I won't be back.

 HAHA! The name is clearly amusing on its own and so was the show itself. Perfect for a ladie's night out. I'm personally not a fan of these type of shows but when you're in Vegas, why not? Actually, it's a lot 'classier' than the one I went to in NYC for a bachelorette party so if I were to choose, I would go back to this one. The show is held at a small theater in the Excalibur hotel and everyone is seated in rows of tables. The bar is in the back of the theater so make sure you bring enough cash to tip the bartender. Personal cameras are not allowed but you can take a Polaroid shot with your favorite Aussie boys at the end of the show by one of their own cameraman.

 Another visit, another Stromboli, dropped one topping choice, added 2, ordered an ice tea and left a reasonable tip and I dang near dropped $20 on this place. WTF was I thinking? Trying to rationalize my stupidity I'll say this is the price I pay for convenience as it is close to work and with a short lunch hour you do what you have to do. But all that money got spent and for what? Boring food. In 3 hours I will have forgotten about what I had for lunch. And since I'm in whine mode let's roll with it. I don't mind a place making money but $3 for iced tea is what I'd pay for a bottle at Kauffman Stadium back in Kansas City and we all know stadium pricing is ridiculous. As for the vaunted crust, the same stuff is used to make the Stromboli and it's not all that. And the pizza sauce if you like to taste tomatoes is ok, but it really needs some spices.... The bottom line: I need to go exploring other places to eat and kick myself out of food ruts like crappy strombolis. And who in the heck puts salami in a stromboli? Bleech. That's what I subbed out, give me my black olives and tomatoes, keep the pepperoni and mozzarella. At least the server working today was smiling and was running her rear end off, and the LVMPD gang unit came in which was interesting. But as I said by 3 pm if someone asked what I had for lunch today I'd have to think about it...as it really was unmemorable. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Saw all the great reviews on Yelp and had to try this place. We were very happy we did! So close to home and love the neighborhood pizzeria feel. Ordered a large pizza with pepperoni & sausage and garlic, 3 cheese Stromboli and garlic knots....OMG the garlic knots!!! They were fluffy pillows of buttery, garlicky goodness that not only smelled good but made our mouths water as their wonderful aroma filled the air around us. The pizza was BETTER than the NYC pizza I had in NYC and made me feel good knowing I don't have to travel 3000 miles to get amazing pizza. The crust was thin, crisp and chewy, sauce was perfect, cheese is good quality and toppings very generous. We will definitely be back and spread the word.

 We found ourselves at Desert Ridge Saturday night, and my husband suggested we check out San Felipe. He was a fan of the former DC Ranch location. Not too crowded for a Saturday night. Ambiance was loud and annoying, but not unexpectedly so. Not really the type of place to go if you want to hear yourself think. Upon looking at the menu, the first thing I noticed was that chips and guac was $9. I don't think I've ever seen chips and guac for $9. Sounded good but not that good. Instead we got chips and salsa for $3. The salsa portion was a small 2.5"" ramekin or so. Tiny portion. $3?! Anyway, also noticed there were no prices on the drink menu. That's annoying. So our server approached and wanted to take a drink order. I asked what was on tap. And then my husband asked about a bucket of Modelo. Our server, Lyndsey, got immediately confused/defensive. Not sure why 2 simple questions would throw her off that way. But, her exact responses, while irritating, are irrelevant. It was the snippy, defensive attitude that kinda got me. Hello. If you don't put drink prices on the menu, a guest could quite possibly ask how much stuff is. Not only did she not know what the exact prices were, her attitude was so off-putting--like the total opposite of someone who wants to provide good guest service and earn a tip. We finally got through the drink order debacle and she took our order and I was already over it at that point. We each ordered fish tacos and my son had fish and chips. The fish tacos were generously portioned for the price point. My son's fish and chips were generously portioned as well. The entrees were decent. The $3 salsa was not very good. It turned out the beers were $4.50 or something. Nothing crazy that couldn't be printed on a menu. Dinner tab for the two of us and our son was $50. Inexpensive and filling, but not enjoyable. Lyndsey was not a good server. Her attitude was poor and she should learn the prices. Definitely will not be making another stop in. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I went to the Chelsea to see Lana Del Rey. I had General Admission tickets and have been to MANY GA venues and concerts. When I arrived at the Chelsea they first had you enter a room, somewhat of a waiting room where they had a make shift line barrier made out of tables. You had ushers checking tickets and providing wrist bands before heading to the long line. As we were waiting in line, the doors to the venue opened and literally there was a stampede of people running to the door, to the point where they climbed over each other and knocked over tables. There was little security for crowd control and the security that was there, obviously had no experience in handling these types of situations. They had half of the ""waiting room"" literally waiting another 1/2 hour until everyone moved back and ""controlled themselves"". How about asking the crowd to create one or two lines, open the doors and ensure everyone gets in, in an orderly fashion. I never experienced anything like this, even at rave concerts. However, once inside the venue wasn't that bad but the drinks were way overpriced. Despite all that drama, Lana was amazing and we had good time. My advice to the venue: Train your employees on crowd control and create a better system for your customers to enter the venue. The sooner you get people inside, the more money you will make off of your overpriced drinks. :) ",0,1,0,0,0

This is a great place to have breakfast without breaking the bank!!! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Man, I needed a haircut while in Vegas. Didn't know where to go and neither did the concierge's at my hotel. So I did a little research on my own, and came up with A Cut Above the Rest IV Downtown Vegas. I'm glad I did! Tim ""O"" hooked me up! The old school music they play is great also! So I say that to say this, when in Vegas and you need a haircut and some ole' school music, check out Tim ""O"" and crew at A Cut Above. You'll be glad you did! Show ya right!

 We got chocolate fondue, which was quite good. Good variety of fruits for dipping, and the chocolate was tasty. We also got milkshakes, which were alright (kind of on the watery side). The menu looked pretty extensive (and expensive!), and includes many different items. (The crepes the folks around us got looked really good.) Unfortunately, the service really ruins the place. We had to wait in line for a table (on a tuesday night). The hostess was not particularly polite either. Once we sat down, we had to wait ages for the server to come by. They brought out our fondue first, and we asked about the milkshakes, and the girl who brought the food was extremely rude. When we finally had everything, we also had to wait ages for our check. I understand that the place was quite busy, but I at least expect the staff to avoid being outright rude to the customers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We had a fun meal here! My friends had the teppan meal and shared with me...very tasty, and fun to watch the chef - he was very entertaining! I checked in with Yelp and received edamame at no charge. I ordered California Roll and Salmon sushi, which was fresh and tasty. The staff was friendly and service was excellent.

 If you're looking for a CD or DVD that's hard to find and you want it now...Zia is your spot in PHX area. I've met a lot of cool employees and sometimes we exchange films/music to watch/listen to, it's really nerdy but in an awesome way. They've always got semi-decent to really good music playing and a huge selection of cult films, foreign films and used DVD's at a very reasonable price. Overall it is a great little spot, used to be even smaller and I'll admit that I liked it that way a little more. However, it's still a lot better than most places. WARNING: Don't pay attention to the ""one"" guy or girl hat works there (Because there's always one) and pretends to know what they're talking about. I'm not sure how you got hired, but stop telling people that The Warrior or lawless are the best films you've ever seen. I mean really,..how many cliche's can you fit into 2 predictable films?? ....ok,..Now that's out of my system. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have been to every hookah lounge in town. This is the only place to go if you dont like the 16-18 punk atmosphere. The servers are awesome and break everything down. Water is free! And the hookah is by far the best I have had in las vegas! Place is massive and decorated the way a proper place to lay back and relax atmosphere should be. Hookahs are brand new design that have been very carefully thought out. And service is vip level for all customers. Outta the way paymons! This place is my new go to place. Food is also very well done and prices are good. I payed 32.70 for all you can smoke for 3 people so anyone saying this place is high go try cloud 9 and see where your bank sits at the end of the night! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Oh IHOP, as far as breakfast places go, you are a staple, aren't you? I've been to this IHOP on numerous occasions with my fiance. He likes IHOP, I go with him to IHOP. I used to frequent this place when I was in high school with my friends. Overall it's just your normal, run of the mill pancake house. Often they have random promotions going on for whatever new kid-flick may be out at the time. The servers get issued garments to wear, blasting the movie in your face, as does their ""new menu items""! I usually go with pancakes or an omelet. Every once and awhile I may order off the dinner menu, but not too often. Their breakfast items are staples and they tend to do them right. Just keep in mind the huge-ass portions you're getting. I tend not to eat my entire meal. This particular IHOP is in the GHETT-O! Because it is the closest to my house is the only reason we come here. The service is usually spot-on and the servers are nice. I've experience better IHOP's though. And I've experienced MUCH better places to eat breakfast. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Charlotte was in need of this place. A modern Pizza/Italian place with good prices, good food and great specials. Service is quick and friendly with the manager coming by both visits to make sure that the food was good. I work in the area and fast places for lunch that are not sandwiches or fast food are few. This place has a great choice of lunch specials for $5 including drink. Even with tip it is cheaper than a combo at my normal go to Which Wich. The large patio is nice, too. Especially nice on Thirsty Thursday (Dollar wine and beer). Other times you can always grab a slice for $2 or during the 2-5pm slot the price drops to a buck. I love the fancy foods on Montford and will always visit my favorite Taco Bell on the same road but it is so nice to have something Not too cheap and Not too expensive but just right. ",0,0,0,0,1

 AWESOME first experience horseback riding! It's $55 for 1.5 hours and $65 for 2 hours. Definitely take the 2 hours to get the full experience. Since most of us are beginners, we didn't get to gallop through the dessert like I wanted to. I guess it would hurt too since cacti are all around. Remember to wear closed shoes (duh) because I didn't and I had to be uber careful that a cactus didn't go through my toe. Anyway, they don't really prep you too much which is good so they don't waste your time. They just let you know how to steer and control the horse. You ride in a line so that the horses know where to go. You roam through the dessert and the best part was going through the water. The horses were so obedient and trained that nothing went too off course. The horses will want to randomly eat, pee, or take a fat dump so you may randomly jolt to a stop! Besides going through water, the best parts were the uphills so the horse would gallop up!! That's when you finally get what you wanted, bouncing up and down on the wild beast with your butt flying up!! Great guides and beautiful place. Lots of horses. I was teamed with my buddy BJ. I miss BJ. Yeee-haww! ",0,0,0,1,0

 This review is based on the bar and drinks. We did not order food. We were looking for a place to rest and relax after walking around and had some time to kill before Peepshow. Our bartender was Maggie and she was great. We had a couple beers and a Waborita, which was excellent! Prices were about what we expected. I was a little turned off by our drinks being served in plastic cups but I guess that seems to be the norm in many places nowadays. We did not order food but the fajitas that kept going by us being carried by servers every 10 minutes or so smelled AMAZING. We will try them next time for sure, as we had nothing but bad luck in the Mexican food department in Las Vegas. A girl came up to us during our drinks and asked us to pose for a ""free"" photo, which she later brought back to us in a cardboard Cabo Wabo frame for only 15 dollars. Does not sound free to me! but we bought it because we liked the picture and we were enjoying ourselves. Why not remember the moment in a free photo that costs 15 bucks? ",0,0,0,1,0

 In our group recently, the men enjoyed a gigantic sandwich of meats and meats, with bacon. The fries were among the best ever we've had. BUT southren* cooking doesn't have to come with a layer of fat 1/3 thick on smoked brisket. And a body expects the brisket to be tender. Pot Liquor's dipping and barbecue sauces are unnecessarily inventive--all the barbecue sauces were composed on the same overly - hot base. The mayo-based horseradish/lemon zest sauce was bland and puzzling. We tried a smattering of other traditional southern dishes, but they were disappointing enough to be unmemorable. Prices were high for the quality. Service was super friendly and excellent. The store doesn't slam you with loud music. Me going back? Nope. Guys might for the sandwich and fries. Order 1 of them for two. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I feel bad 'cause I know this is a local owned business, it's close to me and I believe has been here since I moved here in '94. Used to be the only store and I never had a problem with it. The employees are great! Not sure if more selection has raised my awareness or if this place has just degraded in what it offers. Prices vary - all the markets play their games, price this low to get people in, mark other things up to make the profit. But the selection of fresh produce is lacking and the meat is really mediocre. I have shopped AJ's and it appears Eddie Basha is sending all the good stuff there and placing the leftovers here. Never a great selection, overpriced and I have been really disappointed with the beef I've gotten here. Hope they can stay in business but I actually drive a bit out of my way to hit the Fry's as they have a better selection of produce and meat. Not great but better for sure. I go here now only if I'm in dire need of some staple item and am too lazy to drive the extra few miles. ",0,1,0,0,0

 You know you sometimes get a gut instinct when a place is going to be good? I got that vibe about The Clock, and I was certainly not disappointed. In an area with cheap eating options scattered all around, it can hard to settle on one of the many cafes. But something about The Clock stuck out from the other contenders vying for my hungry attention. Perhaps it's the neo Victorian fronting, complete with pillar box red paint. Or maybe the clock decorating on the exterior struck me as being different from the remaining cheap or samey options. But whatever it was that lured me in, I'm very glad. The Clock is somewhat new to the scene but I can see it being really successful. For a start, it's chilled out, nicely decorated with neutral art and cream coloured walls, and is spacious if you're in with a larger group. It may appear smaller on the outside but they have a secret spiral staircase taking you to a much more open dining area downstairs. If you can't get to this area, there's enough space upstairs for wheelchair or buggy access. Secondly, along with a vast array of delicious, well prepared food, they also have a bottled beer and wine selection! This added bonus, along with the healthy portions you receive with main meals and even with lucnhtime snacks opens it out towards evening diners. The staff seemed to genuinely care about the customers and were certainly passionate about cooking. This showed in the standard of my panini (which was also generously served up with chips and crispy salad). I opted for the Turkish sausage and it was outstanding. For a lunchtime snack it was way above par - definitely of a higher standard. I also received the best hot chocolate I've ever tasted, it was perfect. The girl's skills put me to shame since I would definitely 3 star my efforts half the time. But this one was a work of art! And all of that for a fiver! It's very rare that you find a cafe with such incredible choice. But what really stands out is the pride the staff take in their work. They went out of their way to look after their customers, and the cooking was to die for. Watch as word of mouth spreads about The Clock - in time, this will become one of Edinburgh's dining highlights. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Hash House is a great restaurant to go to for massive portions and delicious food! We had a group of 6 and couldn't finish all of our food for dinner. It was a shame to see the food wasted. We could have ordered 2 dishes and finished everything. We started off with humongous biscuits. They were the size of my fist! The biscuit was pretty good; it wasn't dry. The honey and butter gave it some better flavor. We also asked if there were any fruit jams available from breakfast. There was strawberry jam in the fridge and it was very fresh tasting. Yum! Everyone practically ordered from the breakfast menu. Who wouldn't want breakfast for dinner? We had the following dishes: + Pacers Hash ($12.95) - The potatoes were crispy and the pork as moist. Fresh corn, green beans, asparagus, scrambled eggs, and fruit also came with the dish. One small gripe was the cheese that covered the dish was a bit too heavy for me. Otherwise, great flavors! + Boston Hash ($14.95) - The crab cake was pretty good, and the horseradish cream was not overpowering. The tomatoes in the hash made the potatoes a little soggy though. Dish came with asparagus, fruit, and scrambled eggs. + Hammered Pork Tenderloin Benedict ($14.95) - Wow! This dish was awesome! The pork was so moist. I couldn't believe the size of the pork. The creamy sauce was yummy too. Also comes with a biscuit at the bottom. + Grilled Portabello Mushroom Sandwich ($12.95) - I didn't get to try the sandwich, but I heard that it wasn't bad. Split charge is $2.50 per person. I would definitely come back again and try breakfast during the morning/lunch time. The food is very fresh since the restaurant doesn't own any freezers. You can also visit the Hash House in San Diego. Our waiter told us that there would be another Hash House on the strip in the near future. Yay! Separate men and women bathrooms are in the back of the restaurant. ",0,0,0,0,1

I ended up ordering a frozen hibiscus marg, the carne asada tacos, and substituted the size for the posole. Delicious! The boyfriend had the red chile enchiladas with chicken and pork for the meat.

I submitted a claim in November... it is now MARCH and it still has not been processed.

 Chick FilA is one of the best fast food restaurants out there. They have really worked on the friendly-ness factor. BUT...This particular location has the most languid bunch of workers I've ever seen. I saw four people walk out because the 7 people working behind the counter didn't step up to wait on the customers -- they were too BUSY doing other stuff like paperwork, and stacking cups. When it was my turn, I waited at the counter for 5 to 7 minutes in awe of the complete lack of service. Only one cash register was open while four more customers behind me waited to get somebody - anybody's attention. Plenty of employees were there all milling about and chatting amongst themselves. Hello??? Is there anything more important than the customers? Here's a case where they have gone out of their way to provide decent fast food, a clean environment, small extras like diapers in the bathrooms, fresh flowers, and great attitude by the employees, but then FORGOT to take their orders. I won't go back to this one. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've been eating at Cracker Barrel restaurants for over twenty years, and with the exception of a handful of meals and locations, I've relied on them for road trip meals due to consistency and quality. Living in Buckeye, I'm sorry to say that this location is not one of the better restaurants. The only CB worse than this is the one in Clinton, NJ on I-78. That one downright bites, and I've given them several chances. No, if you have a yen for one of CB standard comfort food dishes, I'd say go to Litchfield Road at I-10 in Avondale and pass on this location in Buckeye. Must be the management......................

 We attended a wedding here and drove from CA to very dry, hot hot hot!!!!! Phoenix and Scottsdale (I was humbled that this area of the country even beat out my own hometown's ability to 'bowl' in over 100+F temps). The Four Seasons stands out in every sense and was a very memorable occasion. Even the drive through the affluent area of golf courses and award-wining architectural designed homes in a desert area fills one with much anticipation. Trying to keep from careening around every winding pass, I kept on looking for it. Ahhhh... *there* it is.... the desert oasis, the gorgeous Four Seasons Resort! This venue is simply amazing... the views are amazing, and the back portion of the hotel was used for the ceremony. What a treat to come here and be spoiled in celebration of a marital union, and have splendid fine dining. I remember well the decor of the hotel: in matching the SW style and the arid desert surroundings, one adjective echoes forth: Tasteful Great filet mignon, lots of laughter (and wine!!), and a beautiful, beautiful wedding venue here. PS Word to the wise... trust me, you're going to be wanting to arrive here with a reliable vehicle. The drive up from Phoenix taxed out our then Camry and I think *it* wanted a piece of some poolside lounging (and a margarita) after the trek! ",0,0,0,1,0

 My husband and I stayed at Mandalay Bay in October, 2009 for our honeymoon. -What we loved: -Our spacious strip view room. -The TVs! My husband had never stayed at a hotel with a TV in the bathroom and he was very impressed. When we got home from our honeymoon we used some of our wedding money to upgrade our TV to LCD, because we were spoiled! -The pool area was great. Unfortunately it was pretty chilly and windy most of the time we were there, so we didn't get to use it much. -The whole hotel just smells nice. A mixture of suntan oil and vanilla. -The casinos were well lit and not terribly crowded. What we weren't crazy about: -It was far down the strip and kind of a pain to get around. We'd take the tram or walk to Excalibur, then cross over to MGM and catch the monorail. -Some of the dining at the hotel was pretty meh. Their buffet and Red White and Blue restaurants should be avoided. They're overpriced and the quality is only okay. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at Mandalay. I'd say we'd stay there again, but I'd be lying. When we go back we'll probably stay somewhere else, as it's fun to check out all the hotels. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The sweet ladies at Linh's saved my wedding day! I got fitted for my wedding dress in Huntington Beach 1 month before the wedding day. I lost 5 lbs by the time I picked it up 2 days before I was suppose to leave for Vegas. The bodice was too loose...and made me look bigger/wider then i really am. Mind you, it cost me over $200 to shorten the dress and add a bushel at Davids Bridal...There was no way I was going to spend more money on alterations there (although the seamstress at DB did a great job). I couldn't justify spending any more monry on my dress. I did an online search for same-day alterations in Vegas and found Linhs. I was worried because some people said it wasn't as cheap as the tailors in OC... and I was quoted $120 to tighten the bodice of (another) dress at a dingey tailor in Little Saigon. I called Linhs 4 days before my wedding. The lady asked me to call back in 5 mins because she was with a costumer. I ended up getting second thoughts about altering the dress and did not call back. But I guess they had my # on caller ID and they called me back anyway! I am SO glad they did!!!! I brought my dress in at 10am the day before my wedding. The shop was bright and clean with several employees. To take in the bodice they quoted me $30!!!! I was SHOCKED! For same day service! DB charged $40 just to RUSH an alteration. After further inspection they saw my dress had 3 layers and told me it would be $40 (not $30). It was still such an amazeballs deal. I was grinning from ear to ear. They told me it would be ready by 5 and if it still didn't fit, they would fix it before they close at 6. They ended up being ready at 2! Thank you so much!!!! My wedding was perfect and my dress looked BEAUTIFUL! Thank God for the ladies at Linh's! Ill upload photos of the finished product. ",0,0,0,0,1

It did not disappoint either...many of the other reviews talked about it being a hole in the wall or a non attractive restaurant but on the contrary it is much nicer than many of the Korean restaurants in Hawaii. The atmosphere is quaint and slightly reminiscent of many local Hawaii establishments. The menu had everything I wanted and the service was absolutely terrific!!

 Ich war letzte Woche um ca. 16 Uhr Nachmittags. Das Personal war freundlich. Durfte mir direkt meinen Salat an der Theke selbst aussuchen. Als mein Steak gekommen ist, ist mir direkt aufgefallen, dass es null gew \ u00fcrzt war. Gut viel kommt eh nicht dran, aber Salz und Pfeffer sollten schon dran. Nun gut ich habe also nachgesalzen und gepfeffert. Aber das Fleisch war wenigstens auf den Punkt. Dann aber habe ich die Pommes probiert. Man kennt den Geruch von altem Fett und so haben die Pommes auch geschmeckt. Was aber noch schlimmer war, ein Teil davon waren die Pommes vom Mittagstisch oder vom Vortag. Die haben genauso geschmeckt und die Konsistenz gehabt, als ob ich Pommes kalt h \ u00e4tte werden lassen und sie dann in der Microwelle wieder warm mache. Also ich bin froh, dass ich nur die Gelegenheit genutzt habe und nicht mich wochenlang auf das Steak gefreut habe. Das war keine gute Erfahrung. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Nice music, the burger was tasty, cooked just right. The crown and diet coke was priced very reasonably and made with ample supply of alcohol. I will definitely go back...soon. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have been wanting to try this place for awhile and was excited that a friend of mine gave in to my suggestion to eat lunch here! The menu has health food selections and even an additional area called the ""lite side"" for even a little lighter. I ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad wrap without dressing and sweet potato fries. They were very accommodating with my side request of no dressing. The cashier was very helpful and cheery. I love happy staff! Seating is plentiful as well, both indoor and outdoor. As it was windy we chose to stay inside. The place was clean, very friendly with clientele and staff. I would happily go back to try more items on the menu. ",0,0,0,0,1

 One word: Kitsche. I was looking for a fun dinner ""experience"" to treat my daughter to. This place comes up in every family dining guide and I guess it's because only kids under 7 would not be completely horrified by this place. First of all - cash only. You stand in line to order. The food is overpriced and very sub-par. You have to cram yourself in on a bench next to strangers (unless you have a group big enough to take up the whole table - maybe 6-10people?). You will probably lose your seat if you need to get up and order another drink or use the restroom. The organ plays... Interesting... Pieces of music. It *is* cool to see how different parts of the room sync with the organ/music as it plays. However it was not worth the overall experience of being smushed next to strangers, overpaying and eating bad food. I will admit - my daughter was enthralled by the ""finale"" song of each set - where they blow bubbles and the disco ball comes out and it's like a 2minute party in the room. But again... Not worth it. It's 2 min of smiles and 60min of torture. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I recently moved to Charlotte and needed my resume for an interview. I went here to get some printed. Although I did have to wait a long time till it was my turn the lady (don't know her name but she had braids and a hat on) there was very helpful and went the extra mile to make sure I had what I needed when it was my turn and that I left satisfied. If I could do it over I wouldn't change a thing besides Next time I'll go earlier in the day. But they really should have someone else back there helping her. The store wasn't that busy I think someone else would make things go faster. I know she was doing the best she could. Thank you! ",0,0,0,0,1

 This is a solid place to grab some quick, cheap Mexican food. The hubby and I stopped in the other day because someone had told me they have very authentic al pastor tacos. They have two sizes for the tacos, $1.50 and $2.50. I recommend you go for the small ones, they are sufficient. The tacos al pastor were good, needed a bit more seasoning but their salsa verde more than made up for it. Hubby ordered the torta de asada which was REALLY good. The bread tasted like bread for a torta should taste like. All in all, we ordered about 6 tacos and the torta and it ended costing like 14 bucks. That is a tremendous deal in my book! ",0,0,0,1,0

 My boyfriend and i scheduled a trip this past weekend (9/28-9/30) I flew in earlier than he did and i loved how courteous the bell man was, he opened doors and brought water to me while i waited for my ride. i wasn't able to get an early check -in but i was able to leave my luggage while i visited some family. the room was just the perfect size for us. and it had a balcony and it was great to enjoy the view. we stayed in the 3rd tower which i read awful reviews from other yelpers about the walking to MGM and the strip. EHH not too bad. When we walked to the strip we took the back way instead of going through MGM (that was smart) and the first night we partied at Hakassan so not having to pay for taxi that night was awesome!! our room was impeccable after room service and i didn't have someone banging at our door at 11am to remind me about checkout time which is great. After all i will definitely stay here again. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The top 3 buffets along the strips along with wicked spoon and Wynns buffet. The price is very high at $52 a person. This place does have the most food though compared to the other two.

 Excellent pastries, just okay brunch. My fiance and I both ordered benedicts for breakfast since the waitress highly recommended it. I wasn't terribly impressed since one egg was pretty much soft boiled and the other was half boiled, half gooey. Fiance had the same deal with his eggs. The hollandaise sauce was perfect though. The fried potatoes were pretty standard, nothing impressive. For desserts, had the George V, a caramel dessert, and a small baggy of macarons. The mousses were perfectly smooth and creamy, the chocolate dark and decadent. The macarons were good (crisp shell, chewy center, not hollow!), but I must say I liked Jean Philippe's more. The packaging held up well enough so I was able to take them on the plane without much damage to the treats, but they are a bit bulky. Payard is going to be a must have whenever I'm in Vegas, but next time I'll skip the brunch and buy all the cakes. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I wanted so badly to like this salon, as I'm always on the look-out for healthier/greener options. I figured a mani/pedi would be a good place to start, so called yesterday morning to schedule an appointment for the afternoon. After scheduling an appt. for 2 pm, I asked about the cost and how long I should expect for both my hands and feet. I was told that it would take 1 hour total and cost $40 (awesome!). I wasn't surprised that my feet took a little longer than anticipated because I had some calluses that needed to be filed down, but she didn't start my hands until 3:30! Overall, I was happy with my pedicure, which is why I'm giving 2 stars. I left with my hands looking like they hadn't been touched, despite the half hour she spent on them and the $25 I paid (see photo I posted). By the time it was 4:15, I absolutely had to leave but reached out to the salon later that night explaining my disappoint and asking for my money back for the manicure. I never heard back.

 The two times I have stopped by have been rushed, which isn't unusual in an airport if you've got a flight to catch. Both times I sat at the bar hoping for fast service, but in each instance I was forgotten for about five minutes after receiving a menu :( The servers behind the bar when I was there (I recognize that there is a lot of rotation in an airport establishment) didn't do a very good job of scanning over their patrons to make sure everyone was taken care of. There seemed to be a tunnel vision thing going on, not much multi-tasking. Obviously it's a tough job to keep up with such a high customer turnover rate, but I've visited busier upscale airport restaurants here at PHX that do a great job and set the bar high. I'll update my review the next time I stop by hoping for a different experience. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I love this place. I went there for the second time on my last trip to Vegas, and while my love affair for the Sahara has come to an end, my love for the House of Lords is just beggining. OK, first off, T-bone steak, mashed potatoes, green beans, a friggin' schooner of really nice cabernet (their wine glasses are huge and they poor big), and a heavenly desert involving chocolate and peanut butter.... $67 and that's WITH a 20% tip. There simply is no room for complaint in that. OK, so some of the other reviewers didn't care for the wait staff. I'll tell you what... this place is in the friggin' Sahara man. Most of those waiters have been there for 20+ years and they know that the Sahara is aching for a wrecking ball. You go in there with an attitude and I could totally see the dining experience head south quick. If, on the other hand, you are pleasant and gregarious like I am, I can damn near guarantee you will have a wonderful experience and a piece of meat that would normally cost you $80-90 a head or more. My waiter was a cool guy who had been there 20 years. Since the place was slow (it was Wednesday night) and I was alone at a convention he took the time to chat for a while. Little friendliness on my part scored great service and a free ""topping off"" of the old wine glass. I reccomend this place whole heartedly. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place is really slow on helping you out. I went in for an appointment with my dog. I went up to the counter checked in with the consultant and she told me to have a seat. I sat down on the benches they have before escorting you to a waiting room to see the vet. After waiting about 30 minutes i finally got into the room and i sat for about another 40minutes to wait. The vets assistant came in took my dogs temperature and pulse. She walked out and told me the vet would be with me shortly. If by shortly they mean having to wait another 20minutes. The vet walks in to examine my pet. Takes my pet to the back and brings her back within 15 minutes. And by the time i pay and get my medicine for my dog from checkin at 830 i left at almost 11. And their was not many people i would say me and 3other pet owners. Ive gone to the animal hospital up on Durango and dessert inn and in and out within 45minutes.

 The Gelato Spot has been around for years at this location. Many restaurants and come and gone, but not this place. Overall, I'm not really a fan of gelato and desserts in general. However an occasional stop in to this place always does a body good. Plus, I've got great memories here! Local Chefs offering up their concoction of gelato at this location; which is pretty cool. However, I'd say stick to cooking and leave the gelato making to the experts haha! The place itself is always updating and changing up new concepts. I noticed a bar now serving up some coffee and an pizzeria upstairs. In the end, that is why The Gelato Spot has kept up with the times.

 What can I say, Great food and great Margarita's...The atmosphere is fun, and lively - the wait staff is excellent (not a bunch of summer kids filling time) but a professional staff. The bar is medium size and elegant looking - and they have 5 nice tall large round table in the bar so you can dine there as well. The main restaurant area is just as elegant as the bar area. We usually sit and eat in the bar areas of most restaurants. The food is always good and the kitchens fast on getting food out. If you like Guacamole, this is the place to get it - they make it fresh right at your table.. and the chips are always crisp.

 So my girlfriend (a mom of 2) is a fanatic for Mexican food and it is Mother's Day so we had to try it. GREAT PLACE! From the moment you walk in you know you're in an authentic Mexican restaurant (decor, music etc.) Everyone (except my lil one) tried something outside of their comfort zone and loved it! The service was incredible and this was even more impressive since it was a packed house (Tip: Make a reservation). We must have been asked 5x if everything was okay which some may think is annoying but I appreciate this in a restaurant and it shows a willingness to correct anything that may be wrong before the meal ends. We'll definitely be back and would recommend it to those wanting a good experience and good food. ",0,0,0,0,1

In addition to the old machines they also have booths that you can sit at to play the new console games. They also have some set up at the bar which is situated right in the middle, so you can drink and challenge your friends. There is also a dance floor in the left back corner.

 This place in the new Aria hotel is nothing short of beautiful. Great place if you want to do it classy in Vegas. As the location should demand, the cocktails were impeccable. In fact, the bartender wasn't satisfied with the first one he made for my partner (we still thought it was pretty good), so he made her a new one. The wine list is similarly thoughtful. The sommelier suggested perfect pairings for our meals. The food itself is good, if not always up to the price point. I love salmon, but was disappointed that it was the only fish option on the menu at the time. It was certainly delicious, but I expected a little more creativity. Whatever's fresh, I suppose. My partner, on the other hand, absolutely loved the lamb. Definitely a good place for a special occasion, but not that friendly if you're not in the mood for meat. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Came to see KISS during their residency at The Joint. We purchased and printed tickets at home so didn't have to go to the Box office. On concert day, we went to the conference door area and were directed to a specific line according to wear our seats were. Doors open at 7 and show at 8, and we went in around 7:20. The next staff person checked my purse by opening each zipper and looking quickly inside. We had checked in a bag at the concierge as they aren't allowed in. The lines moved quickly and there are lots of staff telling you where to go. We went inside and up the escalator to the balcony. The walkways are wide so it's not crowded and cramped. The men's washroom is by the top of the escalator and the women's is closer to the seats. There was a cart of two of people selling beer and drinks along the way. Women's washroom big and clean, so good with no line ups before show time. Our tickets were for the third row (CC) from front balcony. There wasn't anyone there to help us find our seats and I wasn't sure of the section but found a sign by the seating. It was a good view of the stage. Higher the catwalk might block part of the stage but no issues for us. Great sound and music, but also the pyrotechnics with lights, and bangs were cools. There were 2 large screens on each side of the stage which offered closeups of Gene's tongue and Paul shaking his bum. Great stage set up and Eric played his drums high up from the stage too. As with any concert, crowded going down the stairs after the show but once in the lobby, it wasn't bad. Would definitely come see a show here again. Not sure how comfortable it is in the lower bowl as the fold up seats seemed close together. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Wow, this is a tough one. I first heard of this spot a few weeks ago and have been dying to try it. Today I decided to take my Mom out for breakfast and we hit The Duce. Getting there early, we had the place to ourselves. As others have mentioned, there is a LOT going on here, it can be a bit tricky to navigate/comprehend what all is going on, but it's very well done. The Duce is housed in a beautiful old warehouse in downtown, and if you loathe strip malls like I do, you'll find The Duce a welcome change. Concrete floors, old brick, reclaimed wood, it's great. We were warmly greeted by a friendly woman who explained how things worked and gave us the lay of the land. The staff member told us about the great food and told us to either order at the bar or trailer. We wandered around, taking it all in and then went to the food service/bar area of the business. Because we were having drinks with breakfast, we decided to order at the bar. After waiting seven minutes to get someone to come over, an angry looking guy ambled over (picture a chubby Amish guy with terrible prison quality tats) I say hello to the .bartender and tell him we wanted to order breakfast. He grunts, looks displeased and says that we're supposed to order at the trailer. I inform him that we were told we can order here, and since we want drinks we decided to take care of it all at the bar. Speaking of booze, I ordered two bloody mary's. The bartender made a face that would have made sense if I asked him for a kidney. He looked under the bar and said he would only be able to make ONE bloody mary. Keep in mind we are the FIRST customers on a Sunday morning. I was truly puzzled that they could not have the basic ingredients for a breakfast drink staple, much like how it would be if In-N-Out ran out of hamburger. I pay for our stuff and he mumbles something that could be Mandarin, or Pig Latin, I was unsure. I asked him to repeat himself and he was able to use his words and tell me to listen for my name to be called when our food was ready. We found a seat and my Mom was asking what the guy's problem was, and I told her I wondered the same thing. Fellow Yelpers, please know- I am a really laid back guy, I don't get stressed, and can tolerate a lot! That ends when you're treating my Mom poorly, that is NOT okay, especially when we passed over 100 different breakfast spots just to try out The Duce( Matt's Big Breakfast anyone?). Moving on, sorry this is sooo long, but it was so shocking how shitty the service was, really! The place was really cool, the food was pretty good, and the other employee was SO sweet, but sadly all that was negated by the shat service by the bartender. He truly was a turd. Yikes. I will be giving this place another shot, and hopefully they find the bartender a personality transplant and/or the right combination of meds so he no longer a prick. If not, they will need to change the name of the place from The Duce, to The Douche. ",0,1,0,0,0

I had the combo pan roast with shimp, crab and lobster in this tomato based sauce that was just so delicious i wanted to lick the bowl.

 Was hoping for more out of The Pantry when we wandered in for a meal around noontime the other day. They were no longer serving breakfast, and we were informed that certain items on the lunch menu wouldn't be available until after 12:30. Left with a small selection of not-particularly-interesting choices, I opted for a cheese sandwich. Which was fine for a cheese sandwich, I suppose, but secretly I wanted to be eating something more exciting than a cheese sandwich. Service was friendly enough, and the outdoor seating area looks quite appealing. I'd go back for a coffee or maybe to give their breakfast a try, but I wouldn't bother with lunch there again - too many better choices in the neighborhood. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is the best group of doctors I have ever gone to. Our doctor is Michael Levin but we have also seen Dr. Marcy Kulic and Dr. Susan Lee. They are very thorough and always take their time. Their priority is definitely their patients. They are open 7 days a week for well and sick visits. One time when my daughter was sick, Dr.Levin personally called me on a Saturday to make sure she was doing ok. Another time, we thought my son had strep throat and Dr.Kulic called me at 6:30 p.m. on Sunday night to let us know that the test results from that afternoon came back positive and called in a prescription for the medication. They always remember the small details and provide excellent care. I would recommend them to anyone. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Beautiful restaurant inside the even more beautiful Crystals, without the high prices. First off, the service here was very impressive. For a party of over 20, service went smoothly from the the taking of our orders to the splitting of the checks and everything in between. In addition to the service, the food here was wonderful. The server brought out two types of bread- Ciabatta and a fluffier, more rustic bread that everyone seemed to prefer. We asked for more of the good stuff, but the server noted that they were all out since it was close to the end of the night. Bummer! No need to pout, however, as our food arrived just in time. I ordered the Steamed Mussels- 15 or so mussels from New Zealand steamed in a delicious white wine/tomato sauce with diced chorizo, garlic, and marjoram (herb), served with a grilled ciabatta slice lovingly brushed with olive oil. The mussels came out bubbling in a cast iron pan, remaining warm till the very last mollusk. The only hiccup of this dish was that two of the mussels weren't open. Other than that, I enjoyed this dish and thought it perfect as an entree. I also tried a bite of the Sea Bass dish, which was delicious. The skin of the bass was pan seared beautifully, resulting in a crispy skin that was good and contrasted nicely with the meat of the sea bass, which was so tender and melt in your mouth. Adding to the delicateness of the fish was the cream sauce that lay on top. I also tried the Italian Sausage Pizza- Rapini (Broccoli Rabe), Carmelized Garlic, Sausage, Mozzarella Cheese and Pecorino Romano atop a thin, soft pizza dough- which was flavorful and delicious. One of my favorite parts of the meal was how the checks were split. Each check had 5/6 people's orders, and each order's total (including tax and tip) was separate from the other totals. This made paying very easy and hassle-free. I didn't have to do any calculations, except counting the money for our table. Can't wait to try out their happy hour! ",0,0,0,1,0

 The whole park stank of hot garbage. I am disgruntled with the lack of cleaniness in the park. I think that Kennywood can do way more to keep the park clean. I went to the Potato Patch and the cashier wearing no gloves wipes his nose on the back of his hand and then handles money and FOOD! That's a big no no!!! Yes he was using tongs but it's a golden rule sanitation 101 food handlers do not handle money. What gives Kennywood the audacity to think they are outside of these standards? It's frankly pathetic. All of the college kids that operate the rides look like they're about too keel over and die. The park doesn't offer non soda pop options as a fountain drink. Either tea, Hi-C or lemonade I am jaded I'll admit it, but I know when something stinks and Kennywood does. ",0,1,0,0,0

 VERY on the fence with this store now. Bought my first house 6 months ago (huge project house) the first 30days we replaced literally everything from floors and doors to sinks. Spends thousands apon thousands of dollars at this store. Im seriously in this store at least every week with a new project. But now with 3 bad experiences in a row, I am unsure about going back soon. My best experience was always at the paint counter, the guys there were always friendly and saw me daily for over a week. Everywhere else in the store is hit or miss on customer service. 2 or 3 weeks ago I was inquring on wall units, a nice gentleman informed me they did not carry the specific style I wanted, I could special order and it would be there in 4 weeks, or I could go down to the south power store and get them there because they have them in stock there. . . Yeah they didn't have them instock either, they are special order there also. So i waisted alot of time looking for something I wasnt going to find. Last week I went in with a new yard project. I asked for help very specifically on PET friendly products, a associate said 'i think they all are'. I was pretty much in shock, most weed killers are dangerous to dogs/cats. I told her it was very imprtant to me so i needed to be sure. She showed me a product she was ""100% positive"" was safe after 5 minutes. After she walked away I was about to grab it off the shelf but my husband looked up the product on his phone first. He went to the actual products website and read the long page of warnings. In big and bold it said Do NOT let children or animals outside for 24 hours after using product on yard! I was PISSED! My dogs could have ended up poisoned because of this associate talking about something she did not know. I would rather someone be honest and say they didnt know than just give me an answer i wanted. And then today, I decided I want to re-do my laundry room. I saw a sale on wall cabinets and called to inquire. Went through the automatted system, pressed for 'kitchen cabinets' and it rang and rang. Customer service finally answered, they directed me again, and it rang and rang again. Customer Service picked up again and VERY RUDELY informed me there was nobody to take my call, she would take my name and number and have someone call me back. ----Exuse me? there is nobody to take my call? I was shocked.---- I asked 'dont you guys always have a lot of staff on hand?' she (still rudely) said 'yes but she is on lunch' I said 'I just have a question about cabinets' she again stated 'BUT THE PERSON IS ON LUNCH, I can get your number and have someone call you back!' I asked if there was anybody else I could possibly ask a question to. She said ""YES, AND SHES OUT ON A FAMILY EMERGENY,"" I said ""okay then I guess I wont be shopping with you"" she asked (STILL rude) ""are you going to leave me your name and number?"" .... I hung up... Sorry (VERY long story short) You never know what you are going to get with this store, its like some associates are nice and helpful and then others could care less... Today (since i obviously wasnt going to this store after being treated so rudely on the phone) I went to the MESA RIVERVIEW STORE for my cabinets, ceiling fan, and all my other laundry room makeover needs and they were very nice and helpful.

 I loved this Sephora's size and selection, but unfortunately do not feel comfortable returning. I went today and was chatted up by who I thought was a genial older Asian woman...then she asked me if I needed help. I told her no I was just browsing. Moved on to the nail polish center, checking out more of the unusual colors, taking a photo for my friend who is a nail polish enthusiast. Surprisingly the same lady was right behind me asking if I needed help with nail polish. Again politely declined paying attention to taking the pics and texting. It took me a while to realize she was staring me down. She was so on top of me that when my friend called me and I said, ""Hello"", she responded. Clearly she was watching me carefully. I don't like being made to feel like I'm a criminal while browsing at a retail establishment so it's a pass for me. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have been to this place a couple of times. It is a hole in the wall in Sunnyslope, not fancy at all, but the food is awesome! This time we had the Torta Nortena de Pollo and the regular size Shrimp Ceviche Tostada (both items shared between two people). I also had a delicious pineapple Agua Fresca. I was glad we did not each order a torta because it would have been too much food. The torta was very good and the ceviche was heaping and tasty (we ordered it on two tostada shells instead of one). Great value for the price and service staff was very attentive. Try it out! ",0,0,0,0,1

 As I've said previously, I love Sacks and their sandwiches. Compared to the downtown version, this location is nice. The parking is a little confusing, since it is shared with another restaurant, but at least there is plenty of parking! Both outside and inside are pretty cool. I've always called ahead and had my order ready and waiting to be devoured. For such a delicious sandwich, the price is great. My fav is the Symphony - turkey, avocado, and bacon on wheat. Perfection. The employees are really nice as well. I like that I can get in and out quickly at this location (compared to the downtown location). I just wish there was a Sack's closer to home!

 This Starbucks gets some of the worst marks for service, correct drink order and overall friendliness. I normally don't expect to hear: ""yeah, what do you want?"" from the Barista who clearly wasn't having a great day before I stepped up to the counter. This store is way too small for the area and tempers seem always to be short here. The drive-thru doesn't make any sense since it's location only creates a traffic jam.

 If you read my first review of this store you would know I was planning on ordering a prime rib. Well I did on Friday for Sunday evening pickup along with 21 twice cooked baked potato's. When ordering I noticed there was something wrong with the guy taking the order, I later learned he was have an allergic reaction to something. When I get there on Sunday to pick up my order the butcher there was cleaning up for closing time and I tell him why I am there. He looks all over the place and can not find the order or evidence of one ever being made. So he with a smile and great attitude made up what we needed and got it to us quite quickly. This Butchers name I believe is Ed Peet, could be wrong about that but I think I am right. So basically this review is about him, his great service and fantastic representation of his employer. Indeed five star service. Oh and considering what was going on with the butcher who took the original order I can understand how it got forgotten. The poor guy looked pretty bad. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Been going here for YEARS and just love it. Love it! Time to update! It's always an option on a Saturday afternoon when we're thinking of someplace to go to have an early dinner, late lunch or just grab a sammie and some beer. And it's a 30 minute drive for me! The service has always been good and we've never had an issue. We love the sandwiches and the wraps - my fave is the jalapeno steak wrap, although lately it seems that they've had too much wrap and not enough steak. But it IS real steak, not Steak-ums. That isn't always the case at other places. But you can't go wrong - the Lot 17 salad is killer good. And the Jerk Chicken sandwich with the grilled pineapple is my wife's favorite. Not to mention the amazing sweet potato fries and the crack-like brown sugar butter dipping sauce. Always a good rotating selection of good beers and I'm always happy to choose among several I would drink anytime. In fact, I'm getting a strange craving for that steak wrap and some crack butter....

 4.5 stars. Palms hotel is one of the best off the strip hotels, it doesn't take you 15 minutes to get across the lobby like the Rio, so it's a good size. Friendly, helpful, laid back staff. Fun vibes. Young crowd with a mix of some elders haha but mostly young. Good prices. Pros: shuttle to Cesaer's Palace is free, but stops at 8pm. Lots of good places to eat in the hotel. Gym is basic, and quiet and overlooks the main pool. Opens at 7am. Main pool is a fun place, opens at 9am. Casino is on the smaller side. Places to eat: N9ne Steakhouse- beautiful staff, upscale, young crowd, great food. Simon-on the 6th floor, next to Palm's Place pool. Good menu for both breakfast and dinner, fun location, friendly staff, but slow service, more relaxing atmosphere. The rooms are nice, you'll most likely have a great view of the strip, or if not then the mountains, which are beautiful. The only cons would be that the hotel is a bit older (built 2008 I think), and if your anal about cleanliness it's not quite up to par but by no means dirty(like the Luxor ew). Overall, for your money it's worth it and it has an overall great atmosphere! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Jonathan E.'s review is spot-on. I went here for a late lunch on a Sunday and couldn't resist ordering the lamb. I was expecting a hearty hunk of roast leg of lamb, as the menu mentioned the Sunday Roasts selection. Instead, the meat was merely thin-shaved slices of lamb (with plenty of fat to trim away) with gravy. The sides were o.k., but overall this dish was disappointing. If I must eat here again, I'll order the fish and chips, although I was a bit dismayed to see that malt vinegar was not brought automatically to the table. And although we submitted three orders of fish and chips, our server brought back two and had to be reminded that we were expecting a third. This meant everybody ate while one poor sod in our group had to wait patiently for his order to be placed (again). Fortunately, we split a Scotch egg as an appetizer and that tided him over, but it was not much of a treat. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'll admit - Biddy Mulligan's would have been my archetypal stop about ten years ago, back when my liver was healthier and I had more interest in drinking and smoking than in much else. Now, sitting in the corner with the boy and a bunch of hammered university students, I can see the attraction... it's a great student pub. But if you're middle aged, sagging, and like drinking more for the taste than a pleasure akin to being on a ship in a storm, then bugger than, plenty of other opportunities. As for cheap, our two drinks came to a hefty 8 quid (with warm Magners at that...) - if that's cheap, then I'm glad I was a student in the 90's, and not the naughties or later. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place gets a C+ (good thing I gave extra credit points earned with the bathroom presentation). Pros: 1) Aesthetics - the restaurant looks great, the plate presentation looks great, even the bathrooms look great. Love the mosaic tile-job in the bathrooms. Great color scheme overall. 2) Location - it's in the Aria...can't get any closer...and if you are staying in the Cosmo/Aria/Monte - no cab fare! 3) Learn spanish while visiting the bathroom. Seriously...spanish 101 cd is going on while you sit/stand/wait in the bathrooms.....think....loungy music when you get up from the table...stroll 100 paces...enter bathroom...and you hear ""Autumn...Autumn........Beer...Cerveza..........Money...Deniro..."". You get the point. 4) Service - Our waitress was on top-of-it. She got our refills, bill, etc. at just the right time. Cons: 1) Bartender needs to go.......and here's why: I tended bar p/t for nearly 8 yrs. I give a little credit to bartenders when they are a) ""in the weeds"", b) making 5 different kinds of blended/fu-fu drinks c) dinner rush. I expect a Vegas bartender in an upscale hotel restaurant to be able to take a drink order and deliver it to the party within a reasonable amount of time. The main bartender looked as though he was so buried you'd think he was working a night club during the main 1030-11p rush. I looked around and saw every spot at the bar was taken (it only sat ~18peeps) but we were the only peeps standing around asking for a drink. The tables were full but not packed so he wasn't busy with the server's request. There were 2 other bartenders working as well. Then the servers were bringing out dishes for the patrons that were seated at the bar so he wasn't busy with that. The bartender kept going back and forth between us, the patrons at the bar, the servers running around...you get the point. We all ordered our 3 drinks total at the same time. After 15 minutes...he had provided 1...a glass of wine. We didn't order anything complicated...let's see...glass of red wine, Jeiger-RedBull (as a drink), and a Capn-Coke....nothing too crazy. No chicky Cosmo, no fu-fu frozen pina-what-cha-ma-call-it. 3 easy drinks. I looked at the bartender...and he was sweating it...again...not sure why. Then my buddy says...hey buddy....can we get the Jeiger-RedBull and Capn-coke. He is like...oh...oh yea.... no apology, no offer of a freebie or a discount. another 10 minutes he came with our drinks. We paid...and about 1 min later we were seated. 2) Prices.... I know to expect to pay more in a hotel, I know to expect to pay more in a Vegas hotel....and yet I know to expect to pay more in the ""latest and greatest hotel in Vegas"".....but come on. Seriously. $17 for 1 single lamb chop? $16 for 2 mini cheeseburgers? 3) Portions are small...even for a Tapas-style restaurant. Each person will need to order minimum of 3 dishes each. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is by far the BEST buffet I have eaten at in the Phoenix area!!! We were here a few weeks ago for dinner, and again today for the Sunday Brunch. The selection is enormous. And so good... there is so much seafood options to choose from. What I hate about buffets in general is that the food is usually cooked poorly when cooked in large quantities... but that is totally not the case here. All the meat and fish I sampled were cooked perfectly. This venue is very comparable... if not better than most buffets in Vegas!!! Sunday Brunch was $26.... but well worth it. Besides... you can earn your money back for your meal at the slot machines! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I came back to qua because I fell in love with it the last time I was here. The two star isn't for the facility, cuz I still love what the facility has to offer. The two star is for the service I received. The therapist I was assigned to was really nice, don't get me wrong. But here's my rant: My appointment was for 10am. I wasn't brought in at 10, cuz some other lady was brought in before me and it was 10 when she went in. I was brought back to the therapy rooms maybe 3-5 minutes later. Once we got there my therapist talked to me for few minutes and explained what ""when in Rome"" was all about. During the service it felt rushed. And I wasn't able to get to my relaxed state. When the service was over I looked at the clock and it was 11:15. The service was for 75 minute. But it obviously wasn't 75 minutes worth of service. It's more like 75 minutes from the time of your appointment to the time you leave the room. So really the actual ""service"" was maybe around 50-55 minutes. I should of just stuck with my classic massage like last time. ""when I'm Rome"" is usually a $200+ service but I got the summer promotion price, maybe that's why it felt like it wasn't up to par.

 How we found out about this place....amazing.... Kara and I decided to leave my boyfriend at the hotel for a girl on girl bonding dinner shennanigan. I remember i was drunk...and emotional. and drunk.... and a limo driver gave us a free ride. He asked me where i wanted to go to. I said. SUSHI. And luckily, without any attempt of harm, or kidnap or rape...we made it safely to the sushi spot...in a LIMO. fly! Tip: Girls. we just got lucky our limo driver isn't a douchebag. But do not attept to hop in, to any limo just because it's a dashing limo..I didn't think at that point. Thank god we didn't get killed in our short skirts. Anyway.... So...my girlfriend and I ...along with our drunken hungry stomachs..ordered so much sushi, which we devoured in less than an hour.... Service on a saturday night was great. No long wait. and they are really friendly. I had to take my boyfriend here....so we came back here on Monday...again.... What i've tried here so far..i really did like... here we go: (this is from two nights of being here) *First Kiss: Deep Fried Shrimp topped with soft shell crab, tuna and white fish. It comes with a subtle tangy sauce with a flavor that's just about right without overpowering the natural flavor and tast of the fish. *The ""O"" Roll: Chopped deep fried soft shell crab, spicy tuna and avocado, topped with Yellowtail. As the name says.... This is a full blown Orgasm in your mouth. Definitely a must try. It gave me multiples. I had to order this twice. *Palm Springs Roll: OMG. This is an orgasm within an Orgasm. Cubed Tuna in Spicy Mayo and Ponzy Sauce galore, with crab, avocado and cucumber. Soooo Goooooood. This is really amazing. We ordered this on our two nights we were at Kaizen. *Kiss of Fire: If you like Spicy...you'll love this roll. Inside: there's crab, avocado and cucumber... Topped with Spicy Tuna, White Fish, Jalapeno. Sauce: spicy garlic ponzu and hot sauce..... Down this with Asahi or a shot of Sake. you're good. *Kaizen Roll: Who doesn't agree that anything deep fried is just oh. so . good??? and unhealthy? whatever sushi pooper. This roll is a must try as well. IN: Deep fried soft shell crab, lobster, avocado, asparagus, yamagobo,cucumber, radish sprouts.. Topped with Tuna, Salmon and Yellowtail. sauce: eel sauce. *Chicken Teriyaki Bowl: Even their Chicken Teriyako Bowl is not ordinary. It's yuuuummmmy!!!! What i like about this Sushi Joint is that...it's not over-rated and doesnt try to be fancy shmancy like other sushi joints on the strip. They keep their quality and deliver freshness fish after fish..after fish. Service is fast and excellent. Prices are decent. Fish cuts are thick and generous. Selection is different and unique. Definitely recommend this place to Sushi Lovers in Vegas! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Came here on a Saturday last weekend (8/10). Girlfriend was on a guest list so she got in free, however I had to pay. Tiesto was the DJ so the club was packed and expensive! It was $100 for males and $50 for females not on a guest list. I normally wouldn't have paid that much but Tiesto was worth paying for. We got here early around 10pm so the wait was very minimal for me. Was inside within 30 mins with no hassle. If you are certain you want to visit the club, you can buy pre-sale tickets online for a slight discount + no wait in line. Definately recommend doing that when big name DJs are performing. Tiesto came on at around 1:30am. Make your way to the main dance floor before that! The entire dance floor was packed! Extremely hard to move around. He was on until about 4am which was great. Overall the club was huge, multiple floors. The Ling Ling lounge was downstairs for those who are not so into edm. Drinks are average for vegas at around ($15), however they do charge for water bottles!!! I would definitely return depending on the DJ. But I don't think it's worth the price for any random DJ.

 I didn't really like it. Maybe it was because of how much money I lost and how quickly, but why were the minimums so high? I didn't understand that.

It is a HUGE casino and is pretty new, but man the type of gambler that was in there wasn't fun to play with nor were the dealers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is one of those places you go for the atmosphere and beer and not the food. They really do the German thing well, pretzels, spetzels and sausages a plenty. Oh yes and beer and spankings, yes spankings. If you are the S&M, Christian Grey loving person then this is the place for you. Apparently if you order a shot of this dark liquor (Perhaps Jagermister?) you get a spanking by a waitress in a laderhousen (That Hansel and Gretel outfit with suspenders). This I did not indulge in, but many many men around our table did. We went late in the evening so the giant dinning room was emptying out so I assume we didnt get to see all the possibilities of spanking. Okay so the important stuff- the food. I ordered a white sausage dish at the recommendation of the waitress, interesting. I am not a huge sausage fan, but since I was here the sausage kingdom, figured I should try it. It came with potatoes and sauerkraut. I also of course drank a lot of beer and perhaps if I drank more the food would have tasted better. We also ordered a traditional pretzel with cheese dip and mustards, now that was tasty (The beer probably helped with this). I am not going to lie the German dinners that shared our table and the authentic German band probably helped me like this place more, it certainly wasn't the food. So all in all, I would come back to drink and eat pretzels, not to eat. So drink up! Das boot! ",0,1,0,0,0

 This review is more for the local looking to hang out by a pool. This is not the place! Yes, we got in for free being on the guest list but if you do not have a cabana or lounge chair reserved, forget laying out by the pool. Something the VIP guy forgot to mention to us before we said yes to the guest list even when we confirmed we didn't need a reservation. You can sit on benches up near the bar for free and that's about it. My friend I like to listen to music, have some beer, and chill out at the pool but with only 2 of us, we were not about to drop $500 (or more depending on where we would sit.) Plus the place is so small that I could not imagine it packed. We left and went to the Flamingo where we know we can have a seat, enjoy the atmosphere and have room to actually stand up. I don't know if I would even come back to Tao when I do have 10 people with me and pay for this place. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The place is too crowded and cramped inside and the Happy Hour only runs until 6pm while Chandler's other three bars go until 7pm. They charge more ($4.75) at their own brewery for a draft than other bars who carry their beer. When your at the source you should be charging less - how bout $3 a pint? Too bad, nobody cars and there must not be anywhere else to go out to eat in Chandler. All menu items are about $11 or higher and the Nitrogen beer thing they are doing now does not work well. It doesn't taste like beer, it tastes like beer water. Nothing creative either in this brewery's selections, but a couple of the bartenders were nice and attractive.

 Booked on priceline through ""Name your own price"". Got it for $45 per night for three nights. (Because I needed a decent room to sleep at night, not a fan of roach motels.) This was all great. Until a $19 per day fee was added to my bill. Front Desk Manager was a prick about it, I didn't use any of the services included in this ""Resort Fee"" such as ""Free Wi-Fi"" and ""Complimentary Coffee"". Someone there needs to re-evaluate how they use the words ""Free"" and ""Complimentary"". The resort isn't really great either. Seems like anyone can get a 4 star rating. I've stayed at better holiday inns. Also, If you're a big fan of thin walls and hearing everything the people in the halls and rooms next to you are doing and saying, this is the place for you. Overall, I wouldn't stay here if I could avoid it. I'm not a fan of being treated like an idiot by hotel/resort staff. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Professional somewhat sophisticated atmosphere in the Bellagio strip of eateries that specializes in Mediterranean cuisine, I got the scallops and they tasted like filet mingon, the wait staff was very knowledgable and had a wine expert on hand to recommend a nice but cheap (hey i'm not rich) bottle for the table. Try to get seating towards the lake and not the people walking by in the mall area. Not cheap but for a good occasion it is worth it ",0,0,0,0,1

 Not very thrilled with this place, but I gave it two stars for the customer service. I went in because I received a free underarm or eyebrow wax in the mail. So I decided to try out an eyebrow wax. The positive- The staff was very friendly and informative. It was the most comfortable wax I've ever had because they have some sort of special wax that they peel away instead of ripping off. The negative- After the wax, I looked at my eyebrows, and they didn't even look like anything had been done to them. The aesthetician told me as she was waxing me that they can't go over again after they've already used the wax, so I didn't bother asking her to re-do my brows. I can't really complain since it was a free wax, but I don't think I'll be coming back here. All I can say is, meh. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Visited with my sister while I was in town. Waitress was forgetful, kept having to ask her to bring stuff we asked for when we ordered. Regular Greek salad had one olive in the entire salad. Greek fries were good but arrived a little lukewarm. Lots of loud seniors in the place but that wasn't ass annoying as having one olive in my salad. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Went to club 12/13/14 a Sunday night when Brad Garrett headlined with Michael Malone and a Cowboy comedian from TX ( can't recall name) Club is small with tight seating at tiny round two-seater tables. Full bar with wine, beer and mixed drink options. No minimum. 3 pricing options with most expensive seats in first 7 rows. I sat in second section with good stage visibility. Go early because it's not reserved seating. Ushers will seat you according to your category purchased. Only snacks sold are $10/bag caramel or cheddar popcorn, not freshly popped and very small for price. Eat before you go. Be forewarned - Garrett is NOT politically correct and is very adult content but he is hilarious and plays the audience very well as did the other billed comics. I say definite go as long as you are not easily offended by ethnic jokes and overt sexual content. After the show all three comics remain in the lobby for meet/greet/photo ops. Garrett bought a round of drinks for a couple married 42 yrs and distributed logo hats to those he picked on during his set at the end of the show. Very nice gesture. ",0,0,0,0,1

 So I have been to this place twice and I have some good things to say and some bad things to say. First the food is not bad actually pretty good for bar food. Second the beer selections are awesome great craft beers which are always changing I'm a man I like variety so thank you. The big reason for the 2 star is the service. I have never been wowed here in fact the last server we had actually got into a verbal attack with the mother in law because she had asked for a discount because the server forgot to put some of the food on the order and it came out 15 minutes after the rest. Her answer was well you ate it and this is a business. Sorry but really that is the worst answer I have ever heard. I will be back but will ask to be seated in another section. I understand people have bad days so I cant ever say I wont return because of one, but if it happens again that is another story ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm one of the electricians that do 80% of the showrooms here. World Market Center is a huge place that consist of 3 buildings that showcases that latest of furnitures of all kind that you can't find anywhere else. Some are affordable but the majority of the stuff you find here are for those that don't ask for prices. It's mistaken that it's not open to the public which is false. The 1st and 2nd floor are always open to the public but the reason the rest of the floors aren't open to the public is because these showrooms are actually only open about 2 weeks out of the year and the purpose is just to display its latest furniture from different designers. Don't mistake it as a retail store. The majority of the rooms here are just for displays and aren't purchasable. There is also a hidden restaurant here that people don't know about, called Cafe Mundo which specializes on latin dishes. I have never been to it but it has very good reviews on yelp. A very nice place to take that special someone. This place is huge and you can easily get lost, but there are security guards everywhere that are always ready to help. The architectural design of this building is also nice. Check this place out, I'm sure you'll find something you'll like. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I went here for a birthday celebration - for ME of course! It was excellent! Our server was completely fantastic, and even though I really disliked the drink she recommended (the honey lemon ginger with rum), her upbeat attitude was totally worth it. I'm #glutenfree and went with a pescatarian/no-cow-dairy-eating-person, so we are a match made in heaven for horrible ordering. I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole. She ordered the shrimp goat cheese pizza. I love the menu, because it spells out the ingredients (which are all pretty simple - the whole appeal of the natural hippie simple recipe theme) and lists if it's vegetarian and gluten free. The casserole was SO delicious, I would totally go back once a week to eat that! My girlfriend's order came back with cheese on the pizza, although it wasn't listed. The waitress gladly remade the pizza and apologized. See, I told you she was great! They also serve Dos Cabezas wine here - a fantastic winery in Sonoita, AZ. I suggest you get a glass when you go there. They are fantastic people and I love supporting local wineries! I had the rasberry sorbet for dessert and the pomegranate seeds really took it to a whole different level. This place is brilliant, but I'd love to try it again to see if everything else is worthy of five-stars. I hope that the rest of the wait staff is as awesome as the server we had. It's not cheap by any means, but it's worth it if you want TRUE food :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 The staff is generally helpful but the range is limited. The rifle side of the range stops at 200 yards with only a few benches that are usually full. There are a lot of lanes to shoot pistols from and the targets are easy to work with while being well constructed. Safety is top notch but can be over bearing for sure however, that is understandable at a county range. Like any range, many of the range masters are retired military and will talk ad nauseam if you let them. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The scenery at the property was gorgeous. The service was beyond excellent throughout the property- at the lobby, pool, spa...etc. It's a nice resort with very down-to-earth employees. We really enjoyed our stay here. Our room was spacious. The only downside I can think of for our room was that because the door opens directly to the outside, bugs fly in when you go in/out especially at night. I got a few mosquito bites the first night. The spa was excellent and very relaxing. It was quite crowded on a Saturday though. With a spa treatment, we were able to use the facilities for an entire day. The spa had a restaurant, pool, workout rooms, salon, steam room, jacuzzi...etc. Everything was great. We walked out truly feeling pampered and relaxed after spending a full day at the spa. The main hotel pool (Jack Rabit) was nice and quiet. It was opened 24 hours. When it got really hot, the hotel staff brought pitchers of iced water to all of the hotel guests, along with bites of cut-up cold watermelons. The gym was awesome. The machines have touch-screens with TV and all controls for the machine on the same screen. The music mix was just right. The best was probably the cold washcloths kept in a mini-fridge inside the gym. The almost 4 mile loop trail that the hotel recommended for hiking brought us to incredible views. I highly recommend it early in the morning when the weather is cooler. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We really wanted to like this place. They bring the popcorn and soda right to your seat. However, they are really pushing meals. Who wants to eat a salad in the dark or almost dark. Which is another problem. The blue night lights, so people can find their food. The wait staff are always walking through and interacting with the customers. Overall found the experience distracting and won't be back. I can see families or people that like to have food/ drinks delivered to your seat enjoying this option. ",0,1,0,0,0

 You would have no idea which show I was referring to if I said I saw it in Las Vegas and it starred a group of fairly attractive women doing dance routines to prerecorded music while topless. That not only describes ""Sydney After Dark"", but also current strip shows like ""Fantasy"", ""X Burlesque"" and ""Crazy Girls"". Australian accents aside, there is nothing new being offered here. As I watched the prerequisite cowgirl scene, I wondered how/why THIS had become the formula for Vegas topless shows? Maybe having a girl that sings makes it classier than a strip club? There has to be a more creative way to present half naked girls! Oh! They have a girl in a leotard doing an aerial scarves act! That was so cool and original like 10 years ago but a snoozefest today. A topless comedian would have been much better. Keeping with the Aussie theme, they dance to mostly native artists from the ""lahnn daahn undah"" like AC/DC, Tina Arena, Sia and INXS. I can only guess their sultry version of ""Locomotion"" was inspired by Kylie Minogue. They even did an aboriginal routine which left me feeling cultured and educated. That's a lie. The few people in attendance (15% capacity at best) were all moved up to the best seats so buy the cheapest ones if you're going to pay. I would recommend ""Fantasy"" at Luxor over this. The girls are hotter! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I loved the food here. The ambiance is pretty bleh- I was there on a Monday evening and it was pretty much deserted. The only other people next to us were a few cops who were far from experienced. They asked for garlic bread instead of naan, and were kind of rude and insistent that certain dishes they wanted from some Indian restaurant were not on the menu even though they ended up being on the menu and they were just being a little dense. Anyways I got the whole shebang... A mango lassi, appetizer of vegetable samosa, paneer naan (one of their specialties) and vegetable briyani (spiced at a 10 out of 20...I thought it was cute that they asked to say how spicy out of 20..) The amazing thing was that for all of that it came to less than 20 dollars...that doesn't happen in Boston- the briyani alone woulda been 15. And by the way it was wonderful- the golden raisins, nuts, spices and basmati rice were all in perfect harmony :) ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've been practicing Baptiste power yoga for six years and had the great fortune to learn at the ""mother ship"" Baptiste studios in Boston. When I moved from Boston to Charlotte a few months ago, I figured I would find a decent yoga spot here but that it would never compare to my experiences in Boston. Wrongo! Yoga One rocks. All of the other reviewers hit the high points--great facility (showers, lavender scented towels, enough room to move around without trading sweat with fellow yogis = yoga studio Nirvana), reasonable pricing and a great, welcoming vibe from the staff. All of that is really nice, but the true greatness here is the teachers. In the month or so that I've been going to Yoga One, I've been offered a number of meaningful insights and some really excellent assists that have helped me to deepen and improve my practice. For me, that's the real test, the rest of the stuff is secondary. All of the instructors I've encountered are upbeat, knowledgeable, thoughtful, and clearly excited to be teaching yoga. Finding Yoga One has been a real highlight of my move to Charlotte! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Staff just seem burnt out. The customer service is really lacking. They really have no concern in their customer loyalty or keeping customers coming back. The facility is sometimes clean, and sometimes not. The water last week looked disgusting, it looked ""thick"", I can't describe it any other way. The play area toys are grimy, more often than not. But I decided to write a review after this experience: They were using our instructor during our 30minute private lesson to train new staff. He spent most of the time talking to this new staff about how to instruct. When we said something to the staff after about 10 minutes, 1/3 of this lesson, was already wasted. Then, it took a few minutes to sort it out. Now we'd wasted 15 minutes of a 30 minute lesson. This was the first lesson since we have been back where my son was back to being comfortable and attentive in the water and it was wasted on training their own staff. He was off jumping around on the platform and playing. He basically got a 10 minute lesson because they usually play with water toys the last 5min, as a reward for listening. The playing is fine. But I am not okay with spending $42 on a 10 minute lesson. I would also have preferred that they informed me of the training in advance, as I would have known there would be wasted time and then would have rescheduled my lesson....sneaky sneaky bad customer service. The worst part? When the staff started scrambling around after we informed them about the lack of attention during our private lesson...we asked that he stop training during our lesson...the person I am assuming is a manager or owner came out of the office and once she heard what was going on, she hid in the back offices and did not say anything to us. I mean, a manager should have AT LEAST apologized on behalf of the business and the RIGHT thing to would have been to reschedule us for a new lesson. Nope, nothing. Our instructor is good, Adam, which is why we return. And we have now signed up for a bunch of lessons coming up so we will see that through. We are looking for a new school after that. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I find it odd that a place with wasabi in its name served the BF and I multiple plates of sushi with nary a speck of wasabi in sight. Maybe they ran out of the maligned blue food coloring the night we went in, but it was weird for the wasabi to go missing at a sushi restaurant. Blue Wasabi's web site really dances around it, but the original location in DC Ranch has been shuttered. They now have two outposts and a thing for ""villages"" (e.g., strip malls). There is this location in Hilton Village and another in San Tan Village. Unfortunately, Blue Wasabi was better at the original location. The main advantage to the new digs is the increased size. The original in DC Ranch was the size of the postage stamp and the upholstered back room was like something you would find in a condemned asylum. The new space is much larger and a very efficient space planner managed to squeeze out every possible place to put a seat. We were there on a fairly quiet Sunday night and it was fine, but with the communal table running down the center of the restaurant, this place is probably jam-packed on a busy night. The wall of light that changes colors behind the sushi bar is cool. The owners spent at least a few hundred grand on the interior build out. The menu has been dumbed down in the new location. It now offers a number of options clearly designed for folks who won't eat raw fish. The bar food items include the Buddha Burgers, Macadamia Chicken Strips, and Filet Mignon Medallions. Blue Wasabi needs to decide if it's going to be a sushi restaurant or a bar that serves food. You've got to be open to modern sushi if you're going to enjoy Blue Wasabi. If you're a sushi purist, this is definitely not the place for you. The signature rolls are still irreverently named, but they don't have the outstanding flavors that were found at the original location. I suspect the original sushi chef didn't make the move to Hilton Village. It now feels like a second string chef is merely replicating what was once innovative. The BF always enjoys the Eating Nemo Roll of krab (Blue Wasabi has fallen into the fake crab trap) and cucumbers topped with fresh salmon, thinly sliced lemons and ponzu sauce. The Kiss My Bass Roll of shrimp tempura, cucumber and avocado topped with striped bass sashimi and ponzu dressing is also good. In another riff on colors, the Marilyn Monroll is tuna, yellowtail, salmon, spicy tuna, krab (again!), avocado and cucumbers wrapped in pink soy paper. Another different roll is the P.I.T.A. (Pain In The Ass) with tuna, krab, and avocado inside a cucumber wrap with a garlic ponzu dressing. The Where's The Beef Tempura Roll is seared beef tenderloin, asparagus, avocado and shrimp that is then tempura'd and topped with a sweet soy glaze. It was okay. If you like sweet sushi, the Killer Bee Roll is a California roll topped with freshwater eel, sliced mango and a sweet soy glaze. The Signature Martinis are also fun. The BF usually goes for the Wango Mango (Stoli Peach vodka, mango nectar with an orange cranberry splash). I always order the Mello Jell-O (Skyy Berry vodka, cranberry flavored sweet and sour and cran-raspberry juice infused with dark cherry Jell-O). It's like a Jell-O shot martini and that's a tasty treat. Anyone who dines out on sushi in the Valley will not be shocked that Blue Wasabi is expensive. The BF and I never get out of this place for under $100 for the two of us. There are a couple of promotions they run to help out the thrifty diner. The first is Blue Sundays. If anyone in your party wears blue on a Sunday, Blue Wasabi will give you 50% off alcoholic beverages. Their drinks are spendy, so the discount is nice. Somehow the BF and I end up ordering twice as many drinks on Blue Sundays, but we still feel like we're getting a deal. The real deal is Frequent Diner Mondays. The trick is to stop by Blue Wasabi and have a drink during the week or weekend and then return the following Monday with your validated receipt for 50% off all food. Depending upon how much sushi you order, that's one good deal, honey. The new Blue Wasabi is hip, fun and irreverent. It's not as innovative as the original in DC Ranch and I'm not sure that the food and drinks are still worth what they cost. It's best to try to catch this place on a promotional deal. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It's sad whenever a place goes ""downhill"" instead of up. We came here for a quick lunch yesterday (Sunday). We were seated by one of the waitress (which is confusing, because we used to sit ourselves and order up at the counter). We placed our order of 2 burgers (one plain, one BYO with swiss, bacon, grilled onions and mushrooms) and 1 side of fries immediately. 15 minutes and counting later we still didn't have any food. The place had a few tables but surely wasn't packed. AND it's only 2 burgers. That's pretty much the only thing they serve and how long could it possibly take?! When the food finally arrived, it's disappointingly overcooked, bland and small. The burger patties were crisp on the outside and quite dry and tasteless on the inside (but not in a good way, like smashburger way). They have shrinked so much the buns overwhelmed the meat. Speaking of the buns, they were plain; they didn't even put it on the grill or through a toaster. The ""best"" part: my BYO burger only came with 3 out of the 4 toppings I requested. If it took them 20 minutes to fix a burger, it should be perfect. We have decided at this point we'll likely never be back. $6.75 for a dry burger that took 20 minutes yet still missing a topping is probably a ""bargain"" I can skip. However, I do give credit where credit is due. When I informed the waitress that my grilled onions were MIA, she addressed to the manager who offered a free dessert. Granted I think they should have discounted or comped my burger, but at least he tried. And the fries were good. Good luck to The Burger Company, I hope you step up the game because at this rate the future is not looking good for you. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I enjoy Town Square, but it's not my favorite. I don't spend enough time there to know my way around without driving driving driving through all the roads, and I mean all of them. Reasons I go: The Container Store. I spent a lot of time in Texas growing up and The Container Store is a mainstay there. I love that it's here now, too. Whole Foods. Huge floorspace and selection. Cheapest place for lunch here for sure. Sephora. What, you'd rather go to Miracle Mile? Apple Store. The Genius Bar here is really good. I bought my computer here a couple years ago and learned that they don't work on commission, which I was very interested to learn. I haven't really explored it here in depth but once it cools off for good I will. I hate hate hate that they have parking meters on the streets--idiotic. I always go for the free parking in the garages or the lots on the periphery. I have seen officers ticket cars parked over their time--sucks for them! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I typically wouldn't be so excited about eating dinner at a Tapas (small dishes that would normally be consumed as appetizers) restaurant but on this day, I had already gorged myself at an awesome buffet so when our party met up at 9pm for a bite to eat, I was okay with not eating a full meal. The decor of this restaurant is really pretty. Very modern and hip and I felt one of the cool kids on the block. When I first viewed the menu, I had counted for dishes that I really wanted to eat. ""I'm not hungry!"" I told my stomach so I cut it down to two. I chose the shrimp ceviche and the tuna tirado. Both were DEE-LISH-OUS! Some other bites I ate off of friend's plates were the seared scallops and the grilled iron flat iron steak. Very yummy! I know. I hear you. So why not the 5 stars? Service sucked. I don't know if it was a busy night or what but they forgot about us and it took a while for our server to come back and ask if we wanted anything else. When he finally came back, we were able to order desserts and I thought they were just OK. So technically, it should be 3 stars but I'm feeling generous today and only dinged them a 1/2 star each on dessert and service. I'm hoping to go back there to give them another chance on their service but that'll have to wait until my next trip back to Vegas. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Was here for the 2nd time the other night. The food here is awesome! The pizza definitely has more of an authentic Italian feel to it. Got the prosciutto and arugula pizza last time I went. The crust is perfect - it's not super crispy thin - but still light and perfect. Oh, the dessert is pretty awesome too! We ordered a cannoli and tiramisu. Whatever the stuff that's stuffed in the cannoli tastes like chocolate chip cookie dough without being overwhelming. The service wasn't the greatest which is why I'm only giving it 4. I think it was the owner who took care of us, and maybe cuz it was the end of the day or something - but he didn't seem to be in the greatest of moods and wasn't all to welcoming or friendly. We didn't let it get to us. This place is definitely tucked away in a random tiny strip mall on Thomas. You miss it if you blink. But definitely worth the stop to check out. ",0,0,0,1,0

 It is a little hard for me to review a place like Pure because it is not really my scene but I have been to enough of the Vegas clubs to at least be able to compare a little. I like it better than Tao which is at the Venetian even though I like a the Venetian better as a hotel. The outdoor patio overlooking the strip is a great feature of Pure and it is nice to get some fresh air. It can definitely get crowded and hard to move around which is not really my thing but that is what clubs are all about. It is also nice that the line to get in in case you have to wait is inside Caesers and not as much in the odd cattle call type fashion as Tao. I think there are definitely more fun places to hang out in terms of bars and restaurants in Vegas but if you are into the club scene, I would say Pure is one of the better ones. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have been a Steelers fan as long as I can remember. I love the Steelers as a sports team, BUT this week I am very disappointed. Tisk Tisk Steeler higher ups. This does have to do directly with Steelers policy not Heinz Field. I have a 9 month old daughter and I was so looking forward to taking her to her very first Steeler game! Now, she is a very very good baby and in social situations I have been able to take her everywhere. She loves people and loves to take in new and exciting experiences. The point of this is that she would be well behaved, laughing at a Steelers game, and most likely clapping with rowdy fans not throwing a temper tantrum and disrupting the game for others. I would take her out if she was upset, believe me I get it! I feel that The Steeler organization is trying to weed out the younger crowd by charging full price for a ticket and a seat that a baby can't even use. Most kid friendly places don't charge for Children 2 and under, that includes Aiirlines in the US, museums, fairs, Zoos, Concert Venues, Pitt games(at Heinz Field) Baseball games(PNC park), and many more less opulent businesses. As far as the Steelers are concerned even though your child won't be using a seat they have to buy a full price ticket. I asked about Club level seating and yes especially in the club. Which would be the best place to walk around and entertain a youngster if fussy. If you purchase non club seating then it doesn't matter where your baby sits if you have lower level seats. Getting 3 seats together can be much pricier than a pair and are harder to find. I asked why this was the policy and an unfriendly person told me that ""Steeler Policy states that gate operator is not incumbent to assess a childs age of 2 or under so they do not have the resources available for gate entry for people in line entering the stadium."" Sorry but considering the Pirates allow free entry under 2 and offer discounted tickets for children under 2 if they want to participate in the activities for children's days. So NOT COOL STEELERS!

 Screwballs is my new go-to dive bar for HH at the end of a heinous work week! It is in a spot that doesn't get much traffic, so the reviews are true that the service isn't so fantastic...but that's because there is usually only one server/bartender and a person running the off track betting window. But, the bar food is tasty and the drinks are too. The bartender, who has been the same guy both times I've been in, is still very helpful and apologetic if he gets super busy. He stays on top of it pretty darn well for being the only on there. Poor guy. The last time we were in, there was a 2nd server and the service was quick and the food came out in a super speedy fashion. Try the fried zucchini and the garlic cheese bread...sure it's probably just some quick frozen fare, or maybe it's not. But, there is something about it that tastes so delicious with a cold glass of brew. I do love their hot wings as well for as inexpensive as they are. It's worth going in for at least one visit. You may or may not like the service, depending on if they are understaffed. On the other hand, if my review gets more people in...then they will start bringing in a 2nd server every time and no one will be able to complain about it anymore!! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I am continually surprised by the rating style of yelpers who review in Champaign-Urbana. As I write this I see there is a review by M.H. that complains about personally seeing cockroaches and yet gives this place three stars (Yelp definition: ""A-OK"".) We must be in a region of low standards. What would it take to get two stars in this town? One star? Well someone has to stand up. So here is my two-star review. The courier features tired furnishings and an ambiance that varies greatly as you take steps away from the front door. Get seating in the back and you'll struggle to enjoy breakfast in a strange, windowless cave. The food is consistently mediocre. I particularly can't understand why they've chosen the highlights that they brag about. One is their ""special blend"" flavored coffee each day. I foolishly ordered this one. Undrinkable. That experience does technically fit the definition of ""special,"" but I think it's not what they were after. I know they're trying for quirky, and succeeding. The name comes from the space's previous use as a newspaper office. But what does that have to do with the weird but sort-of-cool airplane fan thing near the front door? And why is a tortilla and egg dish named ""rarebit""? Do they know what ""rarebit"" means? Does it have some meaning I don't know? I know that I sound like like a poop in the last paragraph but this is the kind of monologue in my head as I sit at the Courier Cafe. I sit, mystified, and work my way through a plate of undistinguished food. The one ray of light is that for some reason they sell the cut-up edges from pans of brownies in bags by the front register. They call these ""brownie bones."" There are two kinds of people in this world: the person that likes the squishy center part of the brownie and the person that only likes the crunchy edges. They aren't always available, but if you're the latter, I suggest you do stop the courier to buy a bag of crusts. Just don't stay for a meal. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've been here twice for lunch on a Friday. Both times I left happy. I would come back again if asked. First off I love the atmosphere in this place. Such a cute, southern, home-like, relaxing feel. Mismatched lamps FTW!! There's plenty of room on the inside and various different areas to sit in, which makes it interesting each time you visit. I've never had slow or bad service here. The server my first time there not only was speedy and attentive but as I finished their version of an arnold palmer I was asked if I wanted to try a variation of it next. It was incredible. The food was also amazingly delicious. Their fried pickles are pretty authentic in my opinion. Our waitress this time was just as fantastic. She had a conversation with us, she was extremely knowledgeable and put up with our crazy table. The barbeque always good. I have had better luck with the garlic mashed potatoes than the mashed sweet potatoes. As far as drinks the Muddy Waters (non-alcoholic) is fantastic as is a drink I had today that actually involved a sweet tea vodka. Unbelievable. The only downside to Lucille's is that since it's mainly barbeque it has a limited menu. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Nitaya's food is still only okay by way of Thai food, but the service is amazing. So much so, that ti deserves a five star. The server there, a funny, thoughtful guy in his 20's (whose name I've forgotten--dang!) I showed up here yet again with Nicolle and Carol and even though Nicolle had a problem with her dish, he was kind, friendly and very cool about returning the dish for another. He also managed to keep thte table constantly full of water or any other food items, which was fantastic. The best part, however? He made a reference to ""Pedagogy of teh Oppressed."" Any waiter at a Thai restaurant who can cite the brilliance that is author Paolo Friere, deserves to have his restaurant kicked up a notch. Fantastic. Now, can we make the food a bit more exciting next time? ",0,0,0,0,1

 I went here last night to use my new living social deal. The decor is really great down to an awesome place setting, copper cup and copper silverware. I called ahead and made a resey for a Tuesday night and when we arrived there was a reserved sign on the front table. Really nice touch - we got the best table in the house. The food was really good. We ordered the vegdy appetizer platter, veggy meatball dish (skip this), garlic nan, and butter chicken. Everything was delicious and not at all spicy. I think the usual Indian buffets make things really spicy so you eat less, here I couldn't eat anymore b/c I was stuffed. I would be remiss if I didn't give a special kudo to the man who brought out our food and filled our drinks. Best Guy Ever. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Very comfortable sports book that's not too big and fancy. The bet takers are usually very patient and knowledgable although there's definitely a few better than others. I go there several times during NFL season and I'll surely be back for NCAA sweet 16. I'd probably give them a 3 1/2 star rating if available because of a few issues that I think a higher rated book would have? pros; very comfortable Friendly staff clean and secure Not too big (lines aren't out of control) Great overhead HD TV's cons; Ventilation poor.....if there's someone smoking nearby then bring your gas mask! Odds board behind the seating and difficult to see from your seats. It would be nice to have it up front near the TVs No food service although if you're looking for decent ""bar food"" it's close by within a within a short walk. ""Comp drink tickets"" don't come cheap. They used to be 1/$100 bet. Now it's 1/$140 bet I believe.

 My least favorite of the Caesar Ent hotels. Kind of a small casino. Another comped room so we gave it a try twice. Staff is friendly. Hotel gets very crowded and there is not much walking space. Rooms are decent. Not very big, but they do the trick. Just make sure you do not get rooms with connecting doors. You can hear EVERYTHING going on in the next room (not fun at 6:00 am hearing a drunken argument). Best thing about the hotel is its center strip. I still wouldn't stay here if I had to pay.

 I took a friend that grew up in Miami there last weekend. She loved it, said it reminded her of home. She said the Cuban bread was just French bread and not the real thing. The beans and rice were delicious as were the maduros but they were a little too greasy for my liking. I soaked off the grease with my napkin. The atmosphere was lacking, it did feel like I was in someone's house and intruding at times. The TV was so loud it was ridiculous. Is this a restaurant or what? The server was horrible. She was eating while we were eating and never came up to ask us if we needed anything. I felt myself staring her down to try and get her attention to order a beverage and more napkins. It felt a little dirty in there too, I understand it's older and outdated but it can still use a good cleaning. The food was mediocre, I'd probably go again because there aren't many Cuban restaruants but I'll probably order to-go and I'll know what to expect, for the price, it's good. Oh by the way....you can't charge the tip...they only take cash! She was lucky I had cash on me or she wasn't going to get a tip, not that she deserved one anyway. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Beautiful restaurant. Looks as though someone picked the decorations from a catalog, but great, clean setting nonetheless. The service was great.

If presentation is everything, this clearly missed the mark. It looked like a giant blob, but the taste was great and the bacon crispy which was nice.

 We gave this place a try b/c, well, Teakwoods has really been going downhill. What this place really lacks is an identity. We couldn't figure the place out.

 For the long flight to and from Philly, I've taken US Airways twice now. Neither time was I impressed. Was it the cheapest option: yes. And that's how 90% of us purchase tickets, so I doubt the things we complain about will really improve. Somehow on US Air, the seats feel even narrower than the competition despite the fact they fly the same 737s and A319s in the same configuration. But, I had no problem with finding overhead space, which is rare nowadays, so that earns them a bump. No seatback TVs is a downer on a cross-country flights, no TVs of any kind was a bit surprising (though a relief: if I can't control it, I hate having something running in the background). They ran out of food before reaching all the way in the back (though prices were better than the airport to be fair). But the attendants were helpful, professional, and did a second round of drinks. Will I fly them again? Probably, but if there's a flight on United or better for an extra $30 I'd probably take that. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The nachos were made with no care or consideration. Described as ""piled high"", but when they came out, they were maybe 2 or 3 layers of chips with all of the toppings just slopped on top. I ordered the shredded pollo and nothing about that chicken was shredded. There were 5-6 small bite size chunks. I know Mexican food can be easily made by pretty much anyone with any sense of taste or appreciation for Mexican food, but not this place. I've seen better things served at Del Taco. I wasn't expecting fine Mexican dining, but how do you get nachos wrong. Each bite and chip should have some cheese, at least. Chips, cheese, toppings, repeat for 2 more layers. It's not rocket surgery! This place should serve burgers and sandwiches and leave the Mexican food off of the menu. I'm willing to give them another shot, but this first experience was a total bummer. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This review is for their lunch sitting... Wow....that one word sums up this place for lunch. If you would have told me that I would be able to have a sitdown two-course lunch for $12.95 in Uptown, I would have told you you were crazy. This place proved me wrong. Considering my burrito, chips, and drink combo from Qudoba or salsaritas pushes $10, Luce was a real breath of fresh air. A fantastic variety of primi and secondi options, as well as daily specials, and you will be able to return to this same restaurant and never get bored. The great menu options, along with militarily efficient service, makes this the go-to spot for folks who work in the uptown area and have a limited time for lunch. I recommend the authentic ceasar with anchovies and fresh shaved parmesan. They had a tomato and goat cheese soup as a daily special that was out of this world as well. The Mare pasta was amazing....tons of fresh seafood throughout this dish. Most places would serve the pasta itself at $12.95. Instead, I got fresh bread with a white bean and olive oil aperitif, ceasar salad, and seafood pasta for my money. Can't beat it! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Went to the Open Kitchen about a year ago and the inside was very cool, lots of old Charlotte pics. To see how much S Tryon St has changed over the past 60-70 years is amazing.

Compared to other restaurants I think they should offer you a little more food then they do but i suppose its about equal to Olive Garden. I was disappointed that they didn't offer any healthy pasta whole wheat replacements. Overall, it was a nice experience....tried something new but I probably won't be going back.

Their frozen section is really good, too. The frozen meat is sliced perfectly thin for shabu-shabu at home. I also really enjoy the frozen takoyaki. At the front of the store they have a little corner of decorations/bowls/stickers/erasers that are super cute.

 We've used this location for the last time... When we picked up both our four legged babies, a cat and dog, both of them were a wreck! Let's start with my dog. He's a miniature eski. He's super friendly by nature... He's NEVER had a kennel issue in his 8 years. Yet, when we saw him, his nose was bloody on the top snout. We paid for the doggie suite and play time. He doesn't do that. He's never done this at any other kennel. My cat is a calico. I've raised her since a kitten, she's 14 years old. Her gums were worn raw and she has some kind of orange-red stain on her chin fur. I've heard of pets self hurting themselves if left completely alone for extended periods of time, but we were assured they'd get full attention. Bull.

 The name would make one think ""good gaud,"" but actually Gold Lounge is anything but gaudy. It's understated with a retro feel. This lounge doesn't resort to garish attempts for attention, nor did the crowd on the night I attended. Yes, it always helps to be on the list, as our entire group was. But, hello, this is Las Vegas and if you want to ensure a good time in any Vegas lounge, nightclub or restaurant, dress nice and be on the list. Keeping in mind we were on the list and had a table with bottle service, our servers were friendly, attentive and fast. Our table area was very roomy with plenty of seats for everyone, conveniently placed, small tables so we could set down our drinks and enough room for some low-key dancing. The bar area is also roomy and allowed for easy socializing and mingling, without the constant intrusion of a staff member asking you to ""move along."" Drinks were nothing special, but what I appreciated about Gold Lounge the most was the relaxed vibe and the music. There was no fist pumping action. The feel of the lounge, the music and the crowd were all sophisticated and laid back. And, the hubby and I have added Gold Lounge to our list of places to go to for date nights. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place is usually really good. Today I had the worst possible service. The waitress took about 10 minutes to take the drink order, and went to get it, and forgot a coffee, and just brought waters, she ""remembered"" and took 10 mins to come back with the coffee. She then took the order, quick and easy right, sausage and eggs, and a soup (negative ghost-rider) took over 30 minutes to get the order. She (the waitress) never came to inform what might be going on, or an apology or anything; Finally her assistant dropped off the food, and we did not see the waitress all meal long. BILL TIME (Chunn-chunn-Chuunnnnnnn): so I ask for the bill, and explained I have an ""Entertainment e-coupon""... she asked if she can take the phone, I asked, ""do you really need it?"" she said yes, the manager has to see it. I asked if the manager could come to the table if he needed to see it. (my phone does not need to be floating around with people I don't know, for I don't know how long). She said I will get him... yep... you guess, she forgot. I had to walk to the bar to ask for the manager (which wasn't at the bar,like the waitress said), he showed up and used the coupon and handed my bill. While I was trying to pay, I mentioned that his waitress needed some help on being a bit more attentive but its like I was talking to the dirty beer mug in front of me, because he did not acknowledge, just asked me for my card. Then, even though he was in front of a register, he decides to go to another register. I follow him, and then the only words out of his mouth are, ""sign here"" without handing me a pen. When I asked for a pen, he got one, and before the transaction could be completed, he just walked away and left me standing there. HORRIBLE WAITRESS, HORRIBLE MANAGER! These are the type of employees that make people not wanna come back. Very disappointed, as this place is usually pretty OKAY. Never super great, and never super bad... UNTIL TODAY!

 I recently stayed at the Red Rock hotel with my wife and children. Let me tell it was a fantastic experience. Outstanding service great room and the view that will give you a new appreciation for God's creation. We were on the 18th floor with a mountain view of the red rocks. You wake up in the morning and you look at that it gives you a new appreciation for life. They have done a great job of laying out the casino in terms of keeping the adult activities spaced away from where the children's activities are. They have Kids Park that will watch your children well into the morning hours so you and friends or your spouse can enjoy the hotel accommodations or all of the other amenities that the city has to offer. The hotel also has a bowling alley and movie theater. The pool is AMAZING great for a family and for single adults as well. They all have private waiting pools with cabanas and plenty of no reserved lounging and seating areas. It's also only a 20 minute drive from the Las Vegas bled. This is must try place ",0,0,0,1,0

 So this was our first time here tonight. The food is a solid 4 stars. The customer service however is a different matter. Young thug wannabes as servers complete with neck tattoos and ""i don't care"" attitudes. My wife ordered the beef Pho and was well pleased with all aspects of the tasty soup and lean beef. Plenty of garnish choices made for a nice meal for her. I ordered the #80 clay pot catfish. Again, taste wise, it was really good. Portion size however, was very small. Two pieces of catfish (not filet), some broth and a couple of stalks of green onion. After removing skin and bones, there actually was very little fish there. We ordered an additional catfish dish to take home to my son. When we got home, there were two half portions of rice in the bag. Nothing else. We went back and while they did apologize, the reason was ""we are busy"". Uh, yeah. Even though the food is quite tasty, the small portions, lack of customer service and ""I don't care attitude"" translates to WE WON'T BE BACK. ",0,1,0,0,0

I can go outside the theater and spend $10,000 at the slot machine and then gorge at a buffett. Vegas is the epitome of selfishness and gluttony. It would be like a priest camping out at an Adult Movie store. Father...you're doing it wrong. But I digress. The show was strange. Did not flow like most Cirque shows. And there was a female acrobat dressed like a bird and chirped like a bird. The chirp was a bit annoying. You cannot beat the price...perhaps the cheapest of all Cirque shows, and you get what you pay for. Overall it is a decent time killer, but I wouldn't recommend attending. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Everything is so...relaxed at Tahiti Village. Sure, there's a rec room, a gym, a spa, and even a lazy river on site, but its location off the strip makes it feel like a serene resort than a happening place (not a bad thing, mind you). Of course, the shuttle that goes to New York, New York and The Mirage makes it easy to get to the action. We hit a hiccup when we first got into our room, with a missing couch cushion and some stains on the carpet. However, management was completely understanding and gave us a different room at no charge. It's a different experience, but it's still worthwhile. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Awesome food! Steaks are amazing! And service is great too,. 1.5 less star as we asked for 3 different steaks (filet mignon, prime, ny strip) all medium rare but they were cooked -really- differently, one too cooked, the other one not enough. I was fine with it but it did bother my friends. But great experience overall ",0,0,0,1,0

 What can I say about this place except that ""I love it"". I visit there every time I'm in Vegas and I'm never disappointed. Just like the name, the Martinis are amazing. I've had the cookies n creamtini, peartini, & appletini, and they were worth their weight in gold. The venue puts our regular deals through groupon.com and livingsocial.com, so you should keep an eye out for them if your wanting to try the place out for the first time. Wednesday nights are ladies night, and Friday & Saturday nights turn into a night club. They start off with a band playing then a DJ takes over to finish the night off **Make sure to get there before 11pm on the weekends as that's when they start to charge a $20pp cover fee The place is inside TownSquare located in the back of the center and in front of the Rave movie theater upstairs, so park in the back lot. They also have happy hour everyday from 4-8, which is also a nice added bonus. I recommend the lobster salad and the cheese/fruit place for sharing. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I occasionally lead tour groups of young, fun foreigners to Las Vegas, and getting them all (especially the dudes) into a club is always a hassle. I've worked with countless promoters in Vegas with some seriously mixed results. Then a coworker discovered Chris Hornak, and our company's troubles with Vegas have vanished. He always knows the spots worth going to no matter what night of the week we arrive, and I'm amazed that with a handshake at the rope he can get a group of 50 people into a club. Not only inside, but VIP line access for no charge! If he's that good with a huge group, than I can only imagine what he can do for small parties. Check out the website, and let Chris show you a good time! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Pizza in Edinburgh = La Favorita. Simple as that. It's authentic Italian pizza mind, so if you're after an americanised slopfest of stodge, well, best go elsewhere. If you want a pizza that's every bit as good as one you'd get in Italy, this is the only place to go. So often in Edinburgh, authenticity comes at a premium price... not here. Even using a discount card Dominos is more expensive and infinitely more crap. We no longer order pizza, we order a Favorita. It really is synonymous with pizza in our household. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I went back recently with a friend for happy hour. We were excited to have some sushi and enjoy a drink on this nice night. We were told that there were no tables outside available for happy hour except for high tops, where we could seat ourselves. As we walked over to the high top table area, we passed at least one open table in the happy hour section (for which we weren't even offered to wait). Our server brought us menus, waters, and then disappeared. When she finally came back, my friend ordered a blushing geisha. After that, the waitress left and over the next 25 minutes, frequently checked on her other tables around us, but ignored us completely. Finally, after getting her attention, she took our food order. I asked for a sample of a red wine, and the glass came out filthy and unpolished. When our food arrived, the server took our edamame before we had finished them. We also had to ask for soy sauce (the dispenser was empty), wasabi and ginger. I was really shocked, because RA has such a good reputation. Needless to say, this server did not get a good tip, and the only reason I will return is because I am particularly fond of one of their happy hour items. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Signage mentions opened decades ago.Hard to believe I never tried their wonderful food.Have you looked at the pictures? With all the reviews I would like to just be among the admirers. There is evidently a wide apeal per the completely different customers. There were two people speaking and instead of Japanese one spoke in perfect northern Mandarin and the other possibly from another part of China. I am very easily pleased, which shows how unsophiticated I am. Getting excited is not a common occurance. With the exception of the green tea and green tea ice cream I was excited! My prefering the tea and icecream elsewhere probably just shows how little I know. If I could eat five very smalls a day, this would be the place. ",0,0,0,0,1

 My boyfriend and I chose mix for our 10 year anniversary dinner. It was more than we could have hoped for. The Delano hotel is stunning. It was our first time seeing it. You take a very scenic elevator ride up to the restaurant. The restaurant itself is gorgeous with a dark, sexy lounge at the entrance. We walked by a very large and CLEAN kitchen (where the magic happens). The dining room is large and modern. But we were sat in the patio. OMG the view is UNREAL! You can see the end side of Luxor and the entire lit up Vegas Strip! The most romantic table in las vegas and we were sitting at it! The rest of the experience matched the beauty of the view. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable giving us great recommendations and really making us feel special. We had the borabora (a cocktail that takes your tastebuds on vacation!) and did the tasting menu with wine pairings. All the food and wine paired wonderfully. The vegetable salad was delicious and light. The gnocchi was so light and fluffy, perfect little potato pillows. I had the bison and my boyfriend got the filet. Both cuts of meat were cooked to perfection and tasted so good with all the components on the plate. We were brought out a pre dessert in a martini glass. A little sip of coconut heaven!!! The housemade sorbets are a must! I got the exotic sorbet and it was the perfect finish to an amazing meal! Thank you so much to Mix for making our 10 year anniversary so very special and unforgettable! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Well, never turned out to be about 10 months lol. My husband and I have tried this place a couple times since the awful first experience because it's right next to our new eye doctor and has happy hour all day. We went mid afternoon both times and they weren't at all busy. That didn't make the service any better. I guess that's what happens when you give your wait staff their own section of the restaurant with a huge flat screen. The first time we ordered a couple Vegas rolls, some sashimi and a shrimp tempura roll. My husband asked for no wasabi on the sashimi, it came with wasabi. I asked for no cucumber on my tempura roll and it, of course, had cucumber. My hubby really liked the Vegas rolls, I thought they were ok. If you're having something with carrots make sure to order them without as their carrots taste nasty, like they soak them in something before serving. We only went the second time because my hubby's favorite sushi place is closed on Mondays. The second time we ordered the same things plus a gyoza roll. They actually managed to give us our sushi exactly as we'd ordered it. The Gyoza roll was good, but it really needs a topping or something. It's just a giant gyzoa wrapped in rice and seaweed. We might go here again if it's convenient but there's definitely better sushi around. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We had family in town and made reservations for dinner at the Heritage Tavern. I was very excited to try this place, but came away sorely, sorely disappointed. That's not to say that there weren't some highlights, but the lowlights and moments of sheer mediocrity dominated. ATMOSPHERE: The space was very nice and the seating was comfortable. Our party of six had a great table that seemed to be both centrally located and somehow shielded from the hustle and bustle on a busy Saturday night. However, we all found it to be uncomfortably hot in the restaurant, and our wine had to be kept at least 10 feet from the table, which was odd. SERVICE: The service was somehow both warm and pretentious at the same time. The waiter promptly announced that, ""I don't have any additions to the menu tonight... I won't even use the 's-word' [specials] that other restaurants use to try to feed you repackaged leftovers."" That was the first 'are you kidding me?' moment. The second was when another waitress came to the table with a, ""dish compliments of the kitchen."" Was this some sort of innovative amuse bouche? No. It was bread. Don't get me wrong-- I'm all for serving a basket of bread, but don't act like your bestowing some amazing gift on me. It's bread. Oh, wait... it's not just bread, because for some reason the plate had to be explained to us. See that butter? It's honey butter! See that little cup with a few pickled veggies on it? That's a little cup with a few pickled veggies! And did you notice the random little pile of salt? That's ""course sea salt, to cut the sweetness of the honey butter."" (I'm not sure how you're supposed to do this-- is every member of the party supposed to lick their thumb and grab some? Somehow I managed to deal with the sweetness of the butter without doing that.) All that being said, I actually didn't mind the service. The waiter was friendly and classy, and he handled our one major issue (see below) gracefully and appropriately. APPETIZERS: I had crispy head cheese with escargot. The head cheese was fried into two little croquettes. They were light and not too dense or heavy. I wouldn't have known I was eating head cheese. The escargot, however, was completely lost in the dish. I scraped a bit off one of the croquettes and it was very good on its own, but I would have had no clue that it was even there if I had eaten everything together. Several members of the party had a beet salad. Everyone liked it. No one raved about it. In general, I thought that the appetizers were fairly successful, if not amazing. ENTREES: And here's where the wheels came off the cart. My mother ordered the Wagyu burger. It was tiny and served on the edge of an enormous plate with absolutely no garnish or accompaniment. My sister had the salmon. She said that it was, ""very fishy."" Her fiance had a sirloin. He didn't say anything about it. He's very polite. I had the bouillabaisse. It was pathetic. This is a simple dish, and it needs top quality ingredients to work. This wasn't top quality seafood. It was absolutely indistinguishable in size, taste, and texture from the stuff I can buy frozen at Woodman's. There was hardly any broth at all, and it somehow didn't taste like seafood at all. It was just vaguely salty. This dish should have never made it out of the kitchen. That wasn't the worst dish on the table, though. My wife ordered a pork chop. That was apparently sold out, but the waiter said that they could make the same dish with a pork shank. What came out was a large bone with a little sliver of meat and an ENORMOUS amount of fat. I honestly have no clue how this pig even walked on a shank link that. It was disgusting and inedible. Had they not taken it off the bill, it would have plunged this to a one star review. The only person who was happy was my father, who wasn't all that hungry and ordered the tomato soup and grilled cheese. That was one of the cheapest items on the menu. In sum, they sent out three mediocre entrees and two completely unacceptable entrees. Was the food bad? Not really. Was it anywhere close to what I would have expected for the very high prices? Not in a million years. I haven't had such a disappointing meal in some time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This. Place. Is. Amazing. It claims to be Scotland's oldest pub, and it's easy to see why it's still in business since 1360. This place is just far enough out of the city centre that you can justify spending a whole afternoon or evening there, but close enough that almost everyone you ask will know about it or have been at least once. From the outside, it looks just like any given old man's pub, serving real ales and home-cooked food. Nothing surprising so far. But when you get inside the place has a surprisingly young and laid back crowd, with an atmosphere to match. The food is way better than you'd expect in most pubs, although it is slightly pricer. For your money though, you get decent-sized portions and according to the menu certain ingredients like the sausages are sourced locally, so you can feel proud of yourself for helping out local farmers/butchers in the process of stuffing your face with bangers and mash. I'm not a real ale drinker, in fact I'm about as far in the opposite direction as you can go, and there's definitely a good range of spirits and wines to cater for the likes of me. They stock ginger beer to go with my gin for a start, instead of watery ginger ale that a lot of places have. But saving the best 'til last... they still have the original Victorian skittles alley out the back which you can hire out. Most pubs are doing well with a pool table or an it-box, but this definitely trumps a dartboard and I'd highly recommend it. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We really were excited when we saw a family owned neighborhood restaurant near by. The first few times we came here the food was great and the service was too. So when we had an opportunity to bring another neighbor to introduce them we were excited to take her here. We were big time disappointed. They had a skeleton crew on and we waited quite some time to just be acknowledged for wanting a table and there were many available. Then when seated another long wait and no apologies and a bit of an attitude. Well our appetizer ravioli was great so we were ready to forgive the service and the wait. You never know they may have had wait staff no shows so we thought we would give them a break. Our ""FRESH"" scallops though were awful. Gritty and mushy and just didn't taste good. When we told the waitress she was less than friendly. She did get the owner who stopped at the table next to us as loudly asked how their scallops were. When the owner came to our table she flat out told us there was nothing wrong with the scallops she bought them herself FROZEN at costco earlier that day and that the another customer said they were fine. Hmmm then why did the menu say they were fresh? Oh well she basically told us we were wrong and was quite rude. We asked her to taste them but she didn't feel the need. I have since heard friends and neighbors that were thrilled to have a local restaurant but they also said it has gone downhill and they won't go back. Unfortunately, neither will we. Sad because we don't have much out this way and really wanted to love this place. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My husband & I were headed to the Streats event last night when it started pouring over the entire city, so we made a detour to Sushi House Goyemon based on the sudden craving for sushi and it's amazing Yelp reviews. We arrived close to 10PM and the wait was 30 minutes. Luckily, we weren't starving so we enjoyed the outside waiting area on a relatively nice night. Once we sat down and looked at the AYCE menu, our minds were blown. There are well over 100 items available with every nagiri and specialty roll you can imagine. My favorites were the uni (so fresh, sweet, creamy, and beautiful), super white tuna (I felt like the heat of my mouth made the fish melt), sexy girl, crispy rice, and green tea creme brulee. The sushi places I'm used to eating at typically pour a lot of eel/yum yum sauce on everything so I thought that the tiger roll and 911 roll were a bit dry. The 911 roll is no joke. I can stand a lot of spice and my husband could only manage one piece, so I had to polish that dish off by myself. My eyes were slightly watering by my last piece. This is my new go-to AYCE sushi joint with it's expansive menu, fresh fish, nice decor, and good service. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We were looking for a place to satisfy my husband's giant-sized hunger and my need for a good drink. The atmosphere in this place is relaxed and we enjoyed the Hawaiian/island themed decor. I ordered a Big Ass Bloody Mary and it didn't disappoint. My husband got his vodka and cran. The menu had a good variety to chose from and they served breakfast all day! We were in the mood for lunch and my husband got the Kobe burger and opted for the fried egg on top! My mahi tuna teriyaki sandwich was also tasty but very messy. Service was good and it wasn't very crowded and we felt like they just let us be and relax which was also nice. I would like to go back and try more options next time we are in Vegas.

 The restaurant is located in a strip center 2 doors down from a 99 cent store. The decor was a little cheesy. Our server and assistant were friendly but the service seemed a staged. The selection of items on the menu was very good. I ordered the special appetizer, steak tar tar. When the server placed it in front of me it looked like the chef had opened a can of dog food and plopped it on a plate. It tasted great but was a little strained to eat thinking about the canned dog food. Monday's are great they offer all their wines at 1/2 price. If you go in any other day and want to order wine be prepared to pay $40.00 and above for a bottle of wine. If you bring in your own they have a $25.00 corkage fee. All in all I think in todays times you could do much better. Our dinner with wine came to $400.00 for a party of 4. A little pricey for what you get ",0,1,0,0,0

 It's time for me to write some reviews of the churches i've attended since living in Las Vegas full-time ( 2006 ) My church reviews are limited to Sermon attendance on either Saturday, Sunday or Wednesday but primarily Sunday. Also, another confession - i have yet to ""formally"" commit to any specific church ( I won't bore you with the details as to why. ) I've only attended one service at Central - it was on a wednesday. It was a recording of the Sunday service ( not sure which one ) but the music was live. Man, this is one BIG church. Personally, not my cup of tea but after hearing the sermon, I can understand why people might be receptive to a large church like Central. The pastor (not sure if the head pastor or not ) was an excellent speaker. the message was positive with several examples of how the verse applied to current times the music was inspirational. I read some of the material provided prior to the sermon and i am impressed as to how Central reaches out to the community to help. I enjoyed my lone visit to Central ! ",0,0,0,1,0

 from 2011 -- Rancho Pinot never fails to deliver. The ambiance is classy, yet comfy. The service -- knowledgeable but friendly. and the food? well, it speaks for itself. whether starting with goat cheese stuffed squash blossoms topped with cherry tomatoes and arugula, or eating the lamb with lemon and beans, the food is fresh, inventive and wholly satisfying. this past weekend we sat at the bar and have skilled mixologist Travis make us a prickly pear manhattan. stellar! after the above-mentioned squash blossoms, we both had the nightly special -- a frisee and spinach salad, tossed in a sherry vinaigrette, with arizona lobster mushrooms, duck confit, crispy matchstick potatoes and a fried egg from Chef Chrysa Robertson's own chickens. topped off the meal with a new dessert -- a roasted banana/rum milkshake accompanied by two homemade peanut butter/chocolate chip cookies. heavenly! rancho is a well-established restaurant in phoenix, with a mostly well-established crowd. however, younger foodies from all over the valley shouldn't keep from flocking here for the fresh, seasonal, expertly crafted food. wine list is great, cocktails are inventive and service is exactly what you would expect for an establishment of this quality.

 I REALLY ENJOYED THIS HOTEL!!! First off it wasn't too far from downtown, and you can easily catch a cab downtown for not too much $$. It feels like there is nothing around the place but there is, you just have to do some exploring. The staff here was so awesome and friendly, they were very helpful to tell us everything to do around town, what times, have an amazing map and list of places, were just really all about getting us the ALL we needed and wanted to know. The bar inside the hotel was really nice, TV's were nice because sports were on and the bartender was very cool, and experimented with any kind of drinks we could make up he would try to make them and had some tasty concoctions of his own! We really had a great time at that bar, almost too good of a time to actually leave and head downtown for the night, but it ranked higher than a lot of the places we went. I needed a good workout, couldn't ask for a better facility, had an indoor pool too and it was really nice. The equipment was all new and there was plenty of it, I really enjoyed the gym there and visited it a couple times!!!

 nothing really wrong with the food, nothing really good either. my biggest complaint is the price: $12.99 for dinner. included in the dinner price is your choice of soup; I chose the hot and sour. weirdest hot and sour I've ever had. it isn't that it tasted bad, but seemed like it was made by someone who had no idea what hot and sour soup was. it was mostly thin strips of carrots in a light broth. not a bad flavor, but not hot and not sour, that's for sure. the dinner was also supposed to include a greater selection of ingredients. I don't know if it did since I've never eaten there for lunch, but I saw shrimp and scallops listed on the website, and the only seafood present was some suspicious looking kind of whitefish. you also get to choose from pork, beef, sausages, everything frozen and hard as a rock. then, a small choice of noodles (3, I think) a good choice of veggies and a lot of sauces. now, here's my real problem with this place: it's basically a buffet, except nothing is cooked until you order it, and your only choices are noodle dishes. you get a fairly small bowl, put a few pieces of meat in it, then some noodles, then you've got room for a few veggies. then, choose your sauce and wait in line to hand it over to the cooks. avoid this place like the plague if they are even remotely busy. on a Saturday evening I had to stand in line waiting to fix up my bowl, as people just shuffle through line like zombies, then stand and wait to hand your bowl over to the cooks, then stand and wait until it is cooked. sit down and spend a few minutes eating, get back up and repeat the process. I spent more time standing in line than I did eating. and again, the food wasn't bad, but I think $7.99 is a fair price for what you get, $12.99 is criminal. a lot of good Chinese buffets charge around $10 for the dinner buffet, and many also include a Mongolian grill. it's not this big, but for less money they also include egg rolls, much better soup, salads, rice, chicken dishes, beef dishes, pork dishes, sushi....you get the point. here, you get noodle bowls, that's it.

 What is it with this place? Why do these particular employees of this store have such a weird attitude towards customers? My husband whos the most mild mannered guy goes into the store to order a salad today . There were 4 people behind the counter over by the pick up area. They were talking or milling about who knows. Waited 10 minutes then you had to finally say hey can I order something? They said oh sure did you want to buy a paper? He said I wanted to order some food actually and the girl says oh. So that was enough to piss him off he said screw it I will go over to Wild Flower right next door. Apparently they had just screwed up 3 orders and my husband overheard someone asking hey whats with this order whats with this one and each person behind the counter replied I dont know, i dont know, etc. So all of that was just not worth it to him. He didnt want his order screwed up too. just wanted to get that out there because the experience is almost always the same there oh and I am PISSED because I wanted a fuji apple salad! I was mad that my husband didnt take the torture and get me my salad so I now put the blame on you Paradise. Do something about your people or your processes. Teach your employees to greet people and to treat each person that comes in as if they are going to order something! Make it so that it is not uncomfortable for us to go into your store and try to interact with your unwilling and uninviting employees. Teach them some teamwork. Why do each of them act like oh thats not my job. That is so weird and even gross behavior. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This was the most badass Apple Store in the universe back when Apple stock wasn't worth $300 a share and a bevy of retail consultants hadn't convinced them to turn it into an Abercrombie-esque store-cum-gay-dance-club. (Latin cum, not slang cum.) A&F can get away with it because they sell two pieces of cloth sewn together. The Apple Store sells computers. And more importantly, the Apple Store repairs computers. When you can't talk to an employee about your repair/purchase without shouting over the music, your computer retail location has failed to meet its purpose. Couple that with the usual crowds that come with being Chandler Fashion Center and it's a disaster.

 The yard house, where to start on this pretentious place.... Oh i know i will start from the bartender. OK so me and a few friends went here for a few drinks and maybe to talk to some ladies or possibly trannys my friend Sean is all into that, and i say don't knock it till u try it, anyway we sat at the bar and waited for our list of beers, when all of a sudden a man/pedofile crept out of the shadows gliding towards us as if he was wearing heelies or he was a fucking vampire!! he was very creepy and was wearing a trench coat and and a strap on, this guy was fucking creepier than Willam Defoe and it the clown combined!! I am almost 90% sure this guys is on AmberAlert.com, so he crept up to us and was like what can i get u guys...perhaps a beer, appetizer, or maybe a sacrificial virgin!! lightning struck at that very moment as my friends and i screamed like we just saw a picture of Al Roker's vagina!! we tried to keep it cool because we didn't want to end up in a dog kennel in the back of this guys van. I ordered the greatness which was Great white coastal stout and Guinness, it was pretty good but for 8 bucks it wasn't that good. My friends ordered some fucking daiquiris or some fruity shit like that cause there a bunch of pussies. We were thinking about getting another drink and the bartender rose out of the ground as if he had an elevator shoot him out of the darkest depths of hell!! I asked him what type of beer he liked and he said whatever makes an 8 year old girl pass out the fastest, i looked over at my friend and said they serve colt 45?? I ordered a Black and tan cause fuck it you cant go wrong with that...WRONG, my beer was completely flat and warm, so i asked the candy man for a new drink. he told me the beer was suppose to be flat so that way u can drink it faster, right than i knew....i had been roofied!! he winked at me and started to laugh so sadistically that the walls were crumbling and people were fleeing the bar like it was 9/11!! he pulled out a 2 foot machete and licked the blade and said....Can i get u guys any appetizers?? I said i think were just gonna get a booth, he replied ahhhh the bar is way better, u can see all the kids eating with there parents from this view, and its easy to slip roofies in the beer from here. I shook off the worlds scariest comment, and me and my friends grabbed a table. we looked at the menu for appetizers and i was gonna pass on the food, looked a little over priced. My friend ordered the coconut shrimp and my other friend ordered the spicy Asian glazed wings. When the food arrived my friend got 3 little shrimp over a pile of vegan diarrhea, for about 14 bucks. My friends wings looked pretty good, i tried one and they were alright nothing special, like my beautiful baby Tender Greens! We stuck around and tormented our waitress like the bartender taught us, we got the bill it was pretty fucking expensive for a round of drinks and 2 appetizers, but whatever my friends r rich assholes so they paid....i mean rich sweethearts ; ) as we were leaving the bartender flipped down ward from the ceiling like a vampire and said hope u guys have a .....lucky night!! we said, trembling with fear, alright cya.....he replied oh...you will.....you will and let out the loudest creepiest laugh like at the end of predator. the next day my friends went missing and the only evidence that was left of them was a comped receipt from a bartender ...who never existed!

 The venue is huge, but the dim sum sucks! It's supposed to be dim sum all day long, BUT the secret to their success is to warm up the food sitting in the carts all day long.. in the microwave.

They do have really good egg fu yung, so an extra star for the item ordered off the menu. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Came here using a groupon now deal $3 for $6 and I was pretty surprised about how great it was. It is just like yogurt world in SoCal where you have 15-20 different self serve frozen yogurts.

 This was a great dinner. My wife and I were staying at the resort on vacation and knew we wanted a special meal... this did not dissapoint! As many yelper's talk about, the Millionaire Tacos are fantanstic.. the 5 little mini tacos were just enough for a light start to a heavier meal... and do not get me started on the bread (rolls) as could have just had bread and butter and walked away happy. Drinks were yummy (both had mojitos) and main courses were perfect (Beef Tenderloin for me, Halibut for my wife).. we were also blown away by the side dish of smoked paprika garbanzo beans (with spanish chorizo)... it was an outstanding compliment to dinner. We opted for the Warm Chocolate Croquettes which were so good I wanted more even though I was full. This is an OUTSTANDING restaurant! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Today's lunch adventure: Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles at the Phoenix location. I had to let my food settle before I began writing. I am still in a food coma. I can compare this food coma to being Ryan Lochte for maybe 30 mins, because I feel slow and DUMB- Jeah! When driving to this place, you better look for it or you will miss it, but it is kind of hard to miss with people surrounding the door waiting to get in. We found a parking spot, walked in, gave our name and waited a total of 10 mins. We actually stood outside of the door for a minute or two before we went inside to see if your name was called. I have been wanting to come to this restaurant for along time now so I am glad I went with my friend Tamirra. She told me to pace myself because if not I will get sick. I seriously thought by the end of this lunch date I would be sweating grease and my pores would ooze of grease. I order the #9 lil amadi. I order it with 2 thighs and one waffle. It came out in 10 mins and all I can say is Oh my WORD! It was amazeballs. The chicken skin was crispy and juicy and the waffle could have been in the waffle iron for a tad longer but it wasn't mushy by any means. For the drink, I just ordered a water. There were two girls sitting next to me asking what the kool aid menu was, have you ever imagined asking a server what the koolaid menu was for the day? The server gave the colors and the respective flavors. She named them off: red, blue and purple and then went into the actual flavors tropical punch, blue raspberry and grape. Classy! :) Overall the meal was really good, the service was good as well. The server came probably a handful of times, to give us our drinks, take our order, give us boxes and the check. The only complaint that I have, which isn't even my problem but apparently they do not allow outside drinks inside of the restaurant. There was a gentleman drinking a starbucks coffee and a server actually stood there and waited for him to take a ""last sip"" before he had to hand it over. It wasn't as though he wasn't going to order a purple drank! ",0,0,0,1,0

 We were looking for a place to celebrate my Father's birthday and we came across this restaurant at Crystals in the Aria Hotel. It used to be the old Besos (which I wrote a review on). Quinn was our server and she was excellent! Great personality and very knowledgeable about the menu! SHe is a fine dinning boutique steakhouse that integrates fashion and music. Fun atmosphere where there are burlesque dancers that don't speak walking around entertaining the diners in a very classy way! Quinn knew that we were there to celebrate a birthday and we were given complimentary Birthday Cupcake Shots...great way to start the party off! Food was excellent, especially the add-on's like Foie Gras Butter...YUM! Everyone enjoyed their meal and we'll be back to visit on our next trip! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I wouldn't call this 100% authentic Mexican food or even Mexican with a Spanish flair. We did, however, coin a new term: ""Mex-ish"" - which doesn't mean we didn't like it. It means our meal was a delicious interpretation of both styles, creating a new identity and profile for familiar ingredients. The chips were warm, fresh, and crunchy. The salsa was a green tomato variety, with a refreshing vinegar finish. Our beers were icy cold and both served with ripe, juicy limes. I had the brisket tamales with red rice and black beans on the side. My husband had the pork chop special with pineapple salsa, kale, and a hybrid mole black bean sauce. The execution was spot on: My tamales were moist and full of flavor, and the brisket could have stood up to any regular BBQ brisket out there. My husband's pork chop was tender and perfectly seared. Our server was attentive yet did not rush us through the meal. We will absolutely be planning a return visit - this time, to sample a 5- or 8-course tasting menu. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I got the groupon for this business only because it is near my work and I don't regret it. In fact, this is the best groupon I've purchased to date. This used to be a Java Detour but I think it went out of business. All the staff is really nice. And the groupon deal, which gives you $10 for a punch card with ten $6 punches, is such a good deal. Even if you only spend buy $2 plus tax worth of drinks/food every time you come in, you are still getting more than 50% off. (They punch the $6 whether you spend $2 or $6.) If you spend $5 plus tax everytime like me, well, it's a really good deal. If you really want to be picky, you can go over $6, give them the difference in cash, and only get a $6 punch. That way you get the full $60 value of the groupon. But yeah, it's $10 for up to $60 worth of food and drinks. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. I adore the iced caramel macchiato and the veggie breakfast burrito (with taco sauce). Tomorrow will likely be my last groupon punch. But I definitely will be back. Great prices compared to anyone else in town. I'm addicted. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Perhaps it was my point of reference from a recent trip to the East Coast, but Brit & Chips did not live up to the reviews. I was disappointed by the sole with the sour cream and onion batter. The quality of the ingredients from Brit & Chips were questionable. I was overwhelmed by the grease and underwhelmed by the lack of freshness of the fish. The sole was also overcooked. The chips were slightly soft and not as crispy as fries could be. On a more positive note, the waitress was very hospitable.

 Way overpriced for the quality. I ordered a Toro Scallion roll, my wife ordered the Tempura Shrimp roll. Mine was 6 small pieces, my wife's was 8. Both were so poorly wrapped they fell apart picking up the first piece. We sent them back and had them remade. Both dishes tasted good, but could be outclassed in both price and taste by most supermarket sushi. The miso soup was better than most though. The only reason for the second star is because we were comped for the Toro Scallion. Some redemption, but I shouldn't have to send anything back for such an obvious defect. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is very good. Prices are on point and you get a very big hot dog. They have many varieties of dogs including your favorites.

 The bagels at DJ's are great and they have a lot of choices in their menu. It's a great place to go for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I enjoy their bagel sandwiches (including breakfast sandwiches), their salads (especially their caesar salad with bagel chips), their omelets, and their orange juice. They also have green tea. It's just China Mist, but most restaurants don't have green tea, and it's pretty good (fresh brewed). A bagel sandwich costs about 6 or 7 bucks (depending on what kind) and comes with a side. Sides include potato salad, macaroni salad, cucumber salad, and potato chips. They also have good cinnamon rolls and muffins. Check 'em out if you get a chance! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I expected much more being a brand new store. All of the previous reviews were surprisingly good, but I doubt they shop at Asian store every week to know the small differences.

 Spending a lot of my life in New Delhi, iam no stranger to punjabi cuisine which is one of my favorite north Indian cuisines. One of my favorite thing about this cuisine is its prevalance.. you would find little mom and pop stores selling freshly made breads and piping hot sabzi for dirt cheap prices, scattered like crazy. Also, having spent considerable time in various parts of USA including New Jersey and New York I have come to expect specifics from any given Indian restaurant in USA or Canada. But I was pleasantly surprised in this case. I walked in to Pushap just because it was close to where i stayed in Montreal. The appearances are unassuming and the staff were really really busy. The food was striking in its simplicity and authenticity. It brought back memories of all the good times I had enjoying authentic punjabi food from road side dhabas of India. The flavors were just right with no excessive masalas thrown in and the breads were freshly baked/ fried. I ended up paying 15 bucks for a truck load of food 2 of us ate. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Went there with my husband last night to celebrate our 15th anniversary. Had been once or twice and sat at bar. Had good experiences and enjoyed the variety of vegetarian options. Food was good last night, but our waitress needed some serious help. The ordering went well enough, but while we were eating our delicious pasties the waitress started bussing the table behind us. She knocked over what I think was a pretty good amount of red wine in a glass on the table and then left quickly. My husband's back was to the table and he had felt a splash on his arm. I went and looked behind his chair, saw the spill, and saw a huge splatter of wine across the back of his creme colored shirt. Wine was also a platter ed on the floor. The best I could tell is that our waitress either had very dull eyesight or was hoping we wouldn't notice. Another employee walked by and saw what happened and I told her it was our waitress. Waitress came back about 5 minutes later and offered to ""blot"" the wine out w/water......really..like that would work. She then asked us if we wanted anything else, dessert, if my husband wanted another beer. She ended up taking off $14. Said she bought us a round, but $14 didn't even cover our 2 beers much less the cost of my husband's ruined shirt. Pretty much ruined our anniversary dinner and she didn't give a true apology. After reading other reviews it seems like service is an issue at this location. If we ever go back, I would most likely sit at the bar or counter to hopefully avoid inconsiderate waitresses spilling food or drink. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm pretty sure every single review I've written this week has been about Mexican food. Maybe I need a chips and salsa intervention? Nahhhhhhh I bounce between a few items here. The tuna tacos, the crab and shrimp enchiladas and my new fav- smoked salmon tacos. Smoked salmon tacos you ask.... why yes, this is in fact a brunch item. I never thought of Vida as a brunch place until I had these. All the brunch plates come with fruit and jalapeno potatoes. I'm a big fan of the salsa here. I love guac and queso, so sometimes I have a hard deciding which to order at a Mexican restaurant. When it comes to Vida, I go with the guac. Personal preference. Now this is important, sit outside. IMO, Vida has the best patio for sight-seeing in uptown. And by sight-seeing, I of course mean people watching. Bubble (directly above it) also has a killer patio, but they don't have chips and salsa. The Epicentre parking garage is a total rip-off. Unless you are heading to the movies (which validates), park anywhere else or take the lightrail here. There is an Epicentre stop. Parking on the street is free after 6pm. The Wake Forest deck (next to Fitzgerald's) is usually only five dollars. Fitz also validates that deck is you feel like popping in for a drink before you head home. ",0,0,0,1,0

 AMT Coffee should kick-ass. An English business run by three brothers, they started off with one shop in Oxford and have slowly expanded across the UK with a string of distinctive bronze kiosks.

At \ u00a31.45, \ u00a31.95 and \ u00a32.00 for espressos, cappuccinos and lattes, their prices are also significantly cheaper than you know who. The problem is, the coffee.

 Ate dinner there last night. I have to say, Yelpers, you let us down. I had the smoked turkey dinner. When the plate showed up with 4 strips of ""turkey"" smothered in BBQ sauce, I knew this was not going to be a stellar meal and i wasnt wrong. When i say ""strips"", they were literally perfectly rectangular slices the size of a strip of bacon. The turkey was disappointing, the fries were warm (not hot), kind of soft, and definitely came out of the freezer. My fianc \ u00e9e had the chicken special - chicken stuffed with spinache, pimento cheese, and served over mashed potatoes. He liked it. For 2 entrees and 2 beers, That was not $45 well-spent.

 Glad to have a Mexican place in the hood! Came here on an early dinner date and had a nice time. The service was prompt and friendly, the space was simply and tastefully decorated. We arrived around 5:30 and the place was empty but it started to fill up with customers as we were eating. We started with the guacamole and chips and it was a small-ish portion to share (which I actually appreciated, I didn't want to spoil my appetite). Guac was really tasty. I had the pork tacos (can't remember what they're called on the menu now) and they were good.

 I go for the garden area, so that means I enter and exit the garden area. Now what I don't understand is their garden gates don't open until 8 a m, regardless of the season. In the Spring and Summer months the seasonal annuals and perennials out front are frequently dry, wilted or dying. Isn't there some sort of job requirement like the most basic garden experience required? Dried up, over watered plants, plants that have been grown in a greenhouse or a climate unlike ours are put in direct sun and fried to a crisp. And these people are supposed to be a source of information when I have questions about a plant or planting something?! Can you tell me why the overhead watering system is turned on when entry gates are opened. Especially when the gates don't open until 8?

 I found this business via Yelp. Great reviews so I went on a whim. This is NOT the place to go, 1. near or at lunch time, and, 2. if you only want a quick oil change. I specifically said I didn't want my tires rotated (I am actually getting new tires tomorrow morning!) but they did it anyway and the counter guy argued with me. He said it didn't take any ""extra"" time which I can't believe. I was there OVER an hour and while I appreciate all the 'extras,' I wasn't told it would take so long. They even applied my insurance company's sticker on my window. The women working the counter exited for lunch and there was virutally no customer 'service' while I was waiting. Then their printer broke and I had to wait for that to be fixed as well. Hoping I got a fluke bad experience. I might go back for service work but not for an oil change. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have been to Betty's several times over the couple years they've been open. My wife and I would go more often, but seating on the bar side is always an issue. The bar side has three tables that seat six. The rest seat 4. They are big tables and take up a lot of room. The bigger problem is that the ownership does not regulate how many people sit at them. My wife and I went in the other night to meet another couple. Live music was about to start, there was a playoff hockey game on and there was nowhere to sit on the bar side. There was one older gentleman at the very first table by himself with 5 empty seats surrounding him. The six top in the back has 2 older women chatting it up. There was only one 6 top that was being used someone efficiently (4 people). Most of the other tables only had 2 people each. So maybe just move to the Patio right?? Despite having a nice misting system and umbrellas, IT'S CLOSED?? So we end up sitting in the dining room with no TV or entertainment.. Not a bad place if that's what you are looking for, but shouldn't be forced to sit there if there is capacity to sit where we want. So lastly, I mention to one of the workers that if they have mostly tables for 2 and 4, more people would get to sit and the place would be more profitable.. This person said they agree, but that the ownership is not interested in suggestions and nothing will change.. Disappointing.. Ignorant ownership. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place never disappoints! The burgers are always huge and messy (in a good way) and some of the cocktails have a unique twist to them, which I really appreciate. The custom menu makes it easy to get creative, and their regular menu has plenty to choose from as well. I have a dairy allergy but am not vegan whatsoever, so I love being able to get vegan cheese on a regular burger. The space fills up a little too quickly and the seating isn't as comfortable as it could be, bringing the rating down to four stars. I do wish they could expand to a larger location somehow...the Waterfront is an immense shopping complex and the ridiculously long wait times (even with that app!) are the biggest downfall.

 I've been meaning to write a review for the staff and Dr. Majidi but because of the ongoing issue with the other's side insurance, I had to be prudent and wait until it all settles. Now that it's settled, I can happily review with five stars. Dr. Majidi knows what he's doing, is professional, helpful, and very skilled. I found his clinic on Yelp and the raving reviews did not disappointment. Besides from the important fact that he knew what he was doing, he was also very accommodating and sympathetic. His staff was also very professional and talented as well. The massage I received for my pain was much-needed. I'm quite sad that I had to move to California, or else I would continue going here. Thanks for all your help! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I'm a shabu fanatic and idk maybe I'm just being biased because Vegas is just not up to par with SoCal shabu standards...? but this place did not impress me at all. The meat (I ordered kobe chuck) had great texture, but the flavor was off. The peanut sauce was sort of chunky and too sweet. The veggie plate was very very very minimal and not fresh. They did not have the option of brown rice. Service was super slow. The only reason for a star? The sushi chef was so nice! And one more star for the delicious spicy tuna roll. BUT isn't this place supposed to be known for its shabu? MEHHHHHHHHHH. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This review is for Cafe Berlin's once a month German buffet. They have it on the first Saturday of every month. I just happened to try this place for the first time on their buffet night. The buffet has a huge following, and reservations are necessary. We saw some people turned away when they showed up sans reservations. The buffet is $19.99 per person and includes a soda or iced tea. I think the price is a little high for what you get unless you are a big eater. There is a small table in the corner set up with a few chafing dishes, like at a dinner party. I'm not sure if the selections change, but the options we had on the buffet were: cucumber salad, potato salad, peas with carrots, red cabbage, sauerkraut, spaetzle, one kind of brown sausage, pork schnitzel, chicken schnitzel, Frikadelle (German meatballs), and fried Spam. There were some gravies and mustard but that was it. Very limited but most items were very tasty. The weirdest thing was the dessert option: a puff pastry topped with cherry or vanilla pudding, marshmallows and Cool Whip. It was good but it reminded me of something my white trash aunt would bring to the family potluck dinners when I was younger. The small restaurant was packed for the special buffet night and the kitchen had a difficult time keeping up with the crowd; whenever a cook would come out with a pan of fresh food, people descended on them like locusts. At least the stuff was prepared fresh but you had to be on your toes to get something, especially the schnitzel. As soon as it was put out, it was gone. They also ran out of plates several times (but this was quickly remedied). There is one major thing I really dislike about the buffet. For the steep per person price, pretzels and strudel are NOT included. That's kind of sticking it to you when, let's be honest, all of us want a dang pretzel and some apple strudel when we eat at a German restaurant. I ordered the pretzel anyway, but having to pay extra rubbed me the wrong way (especially when the one I was served was overcooked and almost burnt). It would be nice if the owners would include one or two pretzels and one strudel per table with the buffet. Note that if you go on the buffet night, that is your ONLY OPTION. We were told that you CANNOT order regular dishes off the menu (only beer, wine, strudel and pretzels). The service was good and the German employees were so kind and welcoming. The decor ain't great but the place has its charm. I did enjoy the food and I am anxious to return on a non-buffet night. The cucumber salad, spaetzle and red cabbage were true standouts! I will update my review after my next visit. The spaetzle was particularly authentic, it took me back to my trips to Germany! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Kyoto does a good job of doing what it does. That being said, if you've been to one Kyoto, you've been to them all. Tepanaki (you know what I'm trying to spell here dont you?) tables, the Japanese dude lighting onion towers on fire on the table in front of you...taking pictures to put on your birthday mug...yes, its all the same. But its all good. Delicious actually. Never a bad meal have I eaten at Kyoto. Never have I not waited in a line as long as the nile either. ""But I have reservations!"" They dont care. Tell Lisa-Lipgloss to hurry her sweet cheeks up because they wont seat any of you until shes there. Pony up to the bar for some savory (and surprisingly super cheap) saki bombs while you wait, and you'll forget you actually came to eat. If you still have an urge to eat, do it right and get both sushi and a tepan-cooked meal...you'll be impressed and its not overpriced, you get a ton of food. Bring your appetite, patience and your valet money and roll through Kyoto...the annoyances are worth your weight in sushi. ",0,0,0,1,0

 You know the saying, ""you get what you paid for"" - Well this hotel is the definite meaning of that. I'll admit the price was cheap but the quality of the hotel definitely matched the price. When we arrived and checked in, we had a reservation for a king size bed and they told us that they don't have anymore king size beds available and would we consider a double queen size bed room which ended up being a queen/full size bed - smallest queen size I ever slept on - I mean c'mon! What was the point of calling it a reservation when it wasn't even reserved for us in the beginning. Well we eventually got our king size bed the next day, but still it was bad business. We also noticed the type of people that stayed at these hotels were super ghetto! It was like Compton, East LA, with Rednecks sprinkled around the place all in one...kinda felt like prison : \ \ Over all I will not be staying here again unless some serious re-modeling has been done to make this place appealing to the eye.

 This is probably the only thing that hacks me about The Wynn. I'm not a fan of buffets. Mostly because you never know who's dirty little kid stuck their fingers in the mashies, or how long the food has been sitting out. That being said, I've had my share of buffet experiences in Vegas and I actually prefer the Planet Hollywood one to this spot. I felt the selection was lacking, service was slow, and the price just really didn't match up with the amount of sub-par food I was able to consume. Was it the worst? Nah, but I won't be returning.

 This is a wonderful, hidden treasure! I've driven by there a thousand times and even went to the Liberace museum when it was still open. However, I didn't think to try the restaurant until my mom bought a dining deal. I went with my parents and had this old school, throw back Italian meal. My mom had the lasagna, a la carte. Huge piece came out! I doubt you could eat much more than that portion. She took half of it to go. My dad ordered a shrimp and spinach dish (I can't remember the name of it). I tried a couple bites and it was very good. I had this shrimp and garlic dish (can't remember the specific name of it either) but it was very good. In fact, I took a piece of bread and mopped up the rest of the sauce! Every meal comes with a side of spaghetti and marinara. I was too full to eat it but my dad said it was very good. A couple weeks later, my husband and I went for their Thursday night happy hour. It's so wonderful to go into the bar area. If you like anything that sparkles, you'll love this place! The bar is a white piano and sparkles from the ceiling to the floor! They also have live music on Thursday nights. Not sure if they have different acts, but the night we were there the people were very talented. Minimum, my husband and I will be back for their happy hour. I'm sure we'll make it for dinner too!

 Wonderful, spicy, and cheap! When we go, we always get the stir fried green beans with shredded pork.

 This guy that owns this shop is so nice and honest and very helpful. I first went to him in 2004. He actually turned me away and said I had about 70 percent brakes left on my back breaks and about 30 percent left on my front brakes and I should be fine and he told me how many more miles I had left! I went next door to Big O Tires to get new tires put on. When I went to pick up my vehicle the Big O Tire guy told me my brakes were so bad that I shouldn't drive off the lot without getting new brakes put on that was an additional $500 of what I paid. If I had not just gone next door to Mr Brake I might have believed him! What a rip off they are. As a result I went back to Mr Brake about a year later when my front brakes were ready to be changed and I have always used him since. He is always very honest and very reasonable with his prices. He is the best. I only wish he did other services because he is one of the few mechanics I have ever come across that is truly honest and doesn't try and rip you off. The best in town. I always recommend him to anyone I know that needs a brake job. I hope he stays in business for a long time. ",0,0,0,0,1

 My friends and I used to visit District fairly often for happy hour but ever since they changed their bar menu, we all agreed we won't be coming back any time soon. Last time we went, we all ordered the mac and cheese, the pretzel bites, and Kobe beef sliders. The mac and cheese and pretzel were items we had enjoyed munching on in the past while having some beers, so we were sorely disappointed with what eventually came out. The mac and cheese had a familiar taste and it didn't take long for us to figure it out: Hamburger helper with cheese puffs. Listen, I'm not hating on hamburger helper but it's not exactly what I want when I go to an ""upscale"" bar for happy hour. The pretzel bites which were once warm, soft, and chewy chunks of pretzels were replaced by thinly sliced, toasted pieces of pretzel. Think brushcetta only with pretzels. Neither soft nor crunchy, it just lacked any textural identity, which made it all the more disappointing. Oh and the sliders...they looked like two average sliders for $10. Honestly it felt like the chef decided to get a little cutesy with the menu. I'm not against presentation but when it's paired with mediocre food and shrinking portions, it looks all the more ridiculous. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I won't be back. It was just so unremarkable on every level that I can't see myself becoming even a fan. First off, we showed up at dinnertime and there were maybe 3 tables with people sitting at them. A family, some friends raucously laughing in the bar area, and some other crew. We had heard this place was worth trying, and it's quite close to where we live, so we thought, ""why not?"" We are kind of pretzel snobs, so we immediately asked if the pretzel appetizer consisted of house-made pretzels. Negative. One star removed just for that. With so many establishments in the area hoofing it to make their own pretzels, and this place already has some baking happening (pizza), I expected better. We skipped apps and ended up splitting a mediocre salad. I ordered a veggie calzone, expecting something delicious. When it FINALLY arrived, it was enormous and beautiful. I mean, huge! I believe there's a picture of this monster on the restaurant listing. Digging in, i found two types of cheese. Mozz and goat cheese (?). Texture-wise, it was strange because of the mozzarella's super melty-ness and the other cheese's not-quite-as-much-ness. The vegetables inside, once I found them, were boring. No italian seasonings, no char, nothing remarkable. And the marinara served as a dipping sauce didn't deliver either. I couldn't have eaten the whole thing if I'd tried, not that it would have been worth the effort. I read up and saw that other reviewers had better experiences. I believe the Mr. had some good wings, and I imagine that carnivores would appreciate a calzone with some spicy meats inside. For me, this place just didn't make the list of return spots. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've stayed here for personal and also business travel. The longest stay I have had here was five days. Although being in Vegas longer than three days is hard enough, the hotel made my stay on all occasions very pleasant. The rooms were always kept clean by the house keeping attendant and fresh towels were brought up about 30 min after I called for them... which was inconvenient but not the worst I have experienced. The restaurants in the hotel are ok... I would suggest going to another hotel if you were going to eat and were not looking to spend more than $50 a person. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Been living around this place for several years and never noticed it until I saw a small sign on the side of the road that caught my eye. Well, even with the sign just a block away pointing to the shop, it was blocked by another building that made it difficult to spot, going south on Jones blvd. Disappointing orders: Eggs Benedict: A pretty straightforward dish that consists of english muffin, layered with a slice of canadian bacon/ham, poached egg and the most important - hollandiase sauce. What would make or break the dish would certainly be the hollandaise sauce. Well, from experience with more than a handful of different versions of ""eggs benedict"" dishes I've had in the past, their sauce wasn't great or even good in my opinion. The home fried potatoes weren't any better.. Ortega Burger: Came with chili, grilled onions, pepper jack cheese and jalapeno mayonnaise. I didn't think I could've gone wrong with this one but it wasn't nearly as satisfying as the description. The meat was on the dry side, the chili was blah and I didn't notice anything special with their jalapeno mayo spread. Fries were fine, better than anything else offered this morning. I'd rather have Carl's Jr's. ""Santa Fe"" Chicken sandwich over this any day.

 I was pretty disappointed after my dinner at Couscous tonight. I went with my family-- five adults and two children-- and we all ordered dinner and appetizers. My salad was nothing like the menu description and came with--get this-- quartered BabyBel minis instead of goat cheese. I stated to the server, ""I thought this came with goat cheese,"" and he responded that it WAS goat cheese. Really dude? I mean, tell me you ran out. Tell me it was a mistake. Tell me pretty much ANYTHING, but don't lie to me. I know what freakin' goat cheese tastes like. My Mother had lamb that she said was incredibly tough. The hummus and baba ghanouj were mediocre. Meh. It happens. Afterward, we were listening to a street musician a few yards from the door when the server ran out hollering about us not paying... except we did pay and had the receipt to prove it. I'm not outraged, the service was fairly friendly, but the food was a bummer and the fibbing waiter left me unwilling to spend my money at Couscous again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I came here with some girlfriends and we were looking for a great place to kick off our first night in Vegas. The waiter was friendly and seemingly great. He brought us chips and salsa before we ordered, asked us if we liked guacamole and recommended it to us. He returned with our drinks and guacamole. Overall the dinner experience was great, until our bill came with a $10 guacamole charge. I was SO irritated. It's not about the $10 so much as it is about the fact that I got tricked in to buying $10 guacamole! Don't act like you're giving us something complimentary and then charge me for it. It was B.S. It wasn't just us either, by the time the tables on each side of us got their bills they were mad about the same thing. Aside from that, the food was okay. I'm picky about beans and these weren't my favorite, but I liked my tacos. The drinks weren't exceptionally strong or great especially for their price. But it's Vegas, what do you expect? I for one expect not to get tricked into $10 guac but that's just me. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Having lived for 3 years in the Silicon Valley, home to some of the best Indian/Pakistani food I've ever had, finding a good local restaurant is always a high priority. Tonight we tried Maharani. When I crave Indian food, it's not about the ambiance or the service. It's all about curries, rice, naan and spices. While Maharani is a decent restaurant, its food is nothing special. I ordered my usual round of chicken tikka masala, mutter paneer and veggie samosas. The samosas were crispy but the filling was very pasty and far too pureed. I could barely finish my serving of mutter paneer; it was extremely earthy tasting and the paneer quite bland. That said, the chicken tikka masala was pretty enjoyable and had a wonderfully rich tomato curry sauce. Would I eat here again if I'm in the area? Only if Meskerem isn't open. Time to find a better Indian place, I'm afraid. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Went and had the Prix Fixe three course meal while rushing from trade show event to trade show event. Gotta say I was impressed; Bacon appetizer to start, filet mignon entree and a chocolate flourless cake to end it. I'm okay with this. Bacon was about as spicy as all get out. Not for me...but I'm sure it's good for other people. Steak was good, very tender and good flavor, really enjoyed it. Cake was cake. Didn't eat. Hilariously enough, I was too damn tired to finish, I was struggle-bussing to stay awake. The staff was great, kept my water filled. I'm kinda particular about that. Usually just tell em to bring another glass, most just bring a vessel. This guy just kept it filled. Good to go. It was mid-day, slow and no one else was eating, so that worked out quite well as service was quick. Didn't blow me away, but definitely good to go...and $35 for three course at an Emeril joint ain't bad. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Honestly- I tried this place last year and haven't shut up about it since. Was in Vegas last weekend for my birthday and, not gonna lie, totally ate here twice within 24 hours, haha. I was saving the lobster mac and cheese for my actual birthday, but I had to eat something the night before and since I was staying at the Elara (which is attached) I thought, ""Well, I can have the lobster grilled cheese instead, so it's totally not cheating."" The lady serving was super nice and we chatted for a couple of minutes, then my order was ready so I grabbed the container and headed up to my room to get ready for Chippendales (if you haven't been, GO.) I sprawl all of my crap all over my room and jump up on the bed and open the container- IT WAS LOBSTER EFFING MAC AND CHEESE BY MISTAKE. Best. Mistake. Ever. I wasn't even mad- trust. I inhaled it. And then I went back and got it again the next day on my actual birthday and inhaled it all over again. No regrets. It's a little bit pricey - $13 or $14+ per entre, but DAMN, I'm still thinking about it. None of the others I have tried have even compared, honestly. Thank you thank you thank you. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We were looking for a good burger place to go to in Vegas. I came across this place on Yelp and it had fairly good reviews. I ordered the hot wings as an app and was very impressed with them. I haven't had great wings in a long time and they were cooked perfectly and were quite large. I have never had a Lamb burger so I wanted to try it. I must say it was probably the best burger I ever had in my life. It was really that good!!!! I was really amazed of the tenderness and taste, with virtually no game taste. My buddy ordered the Kobe burger with waffle fries. The burgers were cooked very well and the price was just right, about $20 per person. In Vegas for what we ordered, that is a definite win. The only thing that I was disappointed with was the service. It literally took 10-15 minutes for someone to come to our table and get our orders. There weren't that many patrons in the restaurant so it was quite upsetting to me. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone but keep in mind that the service is really not at all great so be prepared to sit a long time. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Came here on a Sunday night at the end of our Vegas weekend trip from Miami....was celebrating my 30th bday. It was completely empty as we arrived at 6:30. Overall service was very good but ordered a filet medium....first was well done; second was raw; third time just didn't taste good anymore! Staff was very apolgetic and gave us a free mac and cheese. But overall I would not return as this is a steakhouse and they can't even cook a steak!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Last week we went to Raising Cane's for the first time. It was pretty much a disappointment all the way around. The Texas toast was decent but the star of the show, the chicken fingers, were bland. I wasn't a fan at all. You Have To use the sauce they provide in order to get Any flavor. We ordered the Caniac Combo and specified, No Fry's, Double Cole Slaw. The person on the speaker repeated the order correctly and the order was repeated correctly again at the pay window. The food was picked up and we drove away. Double Fry's, No Coleslaw. FML.... I hear there's a movement around the country for fast food workers to make $15 an hour. Thing's that make you go Hmmm... I digress. ",0,1,0,0,0

 What a magical place to enjoy my very first dinner in Scottsdale! Fellas, if you're looking for a place to DAZZLE your lady, look no further than The House! I came into town for a work retreat and was completely taken aback by the tranquil beauty of the property and outdoor patio. We were seated outside and enjoyed a beautiful meal under the stars. Months later my head is still spinning from course after course after course which stuffed us til we were barely able to walk! The owner came by and told us that The House is one of the oldest homes in Old Town and I loved all the wonderful stories he told us about the property. Be sure to take a walk around the property and you'll see that the renovations have blended together the historic charm of the property with contemporary accents. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I visit Las Vegas on business for a nonprofit and have stayed here 3 times to keep our costs down. I paid $26 earlier this week. However, had I checked I could have paid $30 at Stratosphere a few blocks away for better room and ambiance. Similar rates were available in nearby downtown (Fremont Hotel, etc). As a result I think I will pay a few dollars more for a better experience next time. Room was small. It was pretty clean although some dirt in bath was missed. Toilet ran intermittently all night. Linens and towels are clean but very worn. No hair dryer or clock in the room, altho they will loan you these if they have them. TV worked OK. Neighborhood is the biggest drawback. There are some empty stores and defunct wedding chapels, plus occasional homeless people and addicts on the sidewalk. These folks are trying, and for some of the lowest rates in Nevada you can't expect too much. I just think the experience is marginal enough that I will look for something more reliable next time.

 This is the great fusion of Japanese and French food. The Spicy mono roll is sublime. The downsides to this place are their menu is not so big and it is quite expensive but worth it. The service is great here and the food is deliciously wonderful. It gets four stars only because the lack of depth on the menu. They have NO unagidon! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Our first impression of these guys was great but after that OH BOY! We were purchasing a new home and from front stoop to back gate are really doing it up. We saw them at the Home Show in Phoenix and immediately made an appointment. They explained that usually the rep comes to the house. We asked for a meeting in the Scottsdale Showroom instead as we wanted to see our options. Written in large print on our reservation and circled were the words MEET AT SCOTTSDALE SHOWROOM. So yesterday we (living in Tempe) took time off work and drove up there for our 3pm meeting. At 230 as we were preparing to leave we got a call from Shawn asking if we could make it earlier but since we were just leaving we couldn't. So we drive to Scottsdale and walk in the door. The gal in the back of the store yells out - ""hi how can we help you"". We yell back (oddly she seems opposed to getting out of her chair - maybe she has a condition or something so I don't want to judge) ""we are here for our appointment at 3pm with Shawn"". She yells out - ""sorry don't see you have an appointment here"". I yell back - ""well here is my paperwork showing I do"" as I wave the yellow sheet. ""Nope I don't see it"" she yells back (still not getting up from the chair and walking towards us - just yelling back and forth). After a few more volleys of us inquiring if she happens to know Shawn if this is really First Impressions if maybe Shawn was given the wrong info and was at our home etc. I finally walk back to the back and show her our appointment card. At this point I am ready to be done with First Impression and she still has no idea how to handle the situation (maybe you could call Shawn, maybe standing up to great your potential customer who is preparing to drop $5-10k with you today, maybe apologize and offer to assist us) so we just decided to end the yelling and leave. On the way back we call Shawn and sure enough he was given the wrong info and is sitting in our drive. We suggest either he waits, we go back to the showroom or we reschedule. Shawn is not able to decide what he wants to do - but eventually offers to wait. He says he doesn't really want to just sit in his car and asks for suggestions of what he can do while waiting (huh seriously, you don't have a google machine, you can't catch up on sales calls, no cat videos are left on the interwebs?) ... he asks ""is there a starbucks close"" - so we give him directions. At this point my wife has joined me in being fed up and she tells him we will reschedule at another time. Yes we will - with anyone other than First Impression. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Bleh. Mediocre at best. To state the obvious it is a buffet.. not a 5 star restaurant. Either way, I was disappointed. Ive been to a whole ton of buffets in Vegas, we come at least once a year. The Rio is supposed to have one of the top buffets in vegas. Ask around. The Rio is the place to hit.. or the Bellagio. I digress. The food was okay. One star up from Hometown i suppose. I dont remember the last time i went to one, but... theres a reason for it. They suck. I suppose a buffet is a place to stuff your face with everything u can think of.. at once,get full and pass out. Definitely not a place for quality. Starch, meat, some more starch, and a salad bar. Goodie! Ohh! and the vegeterian options? Minimal at best. Lettuce and macaroni and cheese? What a meal! 1 star for having bananas foster... and okay gelato. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Really it's just a bar, not much more. There are a couple of fun, fruity drinks for the ladies, all very expensive. I suppose for the purpose of dancing and drinking it's your one good free option and for that you get two stars. I was there earlier in the evening for some pre-dinner drinks. Not too busy except for the hookers looking for work, again because it's free I think you expect to see that. Relaxing yes, good spot for people watching yes, extremely memorable, no. ",0,1,0,0,0

 More of a 4.5. BFG is GOOD chicken! get ready for me to say ""really good"" 100 times. (Full disclosure: I know the owners/chefs, but that won't make me go twice in a week. The FOOD makes me go back 2x!) Portion sizes are plenty! The meals are $5.75, I think, and that is 4 strips, plenty of fries/sides with dipping sauces. Here's what we've had: Grilled Chicken is juicy and has a very nice, fresh yet mild marinade. The quality of the chicken seem higher than grilled chicken you get at KFC or other fast foods. Fried Chicken is panko-breaded which is a great switch from the norm, and just as juicy as the grilled chicken. If you want a fuller meal, go for these! My husband thinks this portion size borders on large. I don't love fried food, because I tend to feel the grease in my mouth for hours (cough cough, CANES). But these are fresh and leave the plate dry! No grease there. Super good. The french fries are super good. They are the kind of fries that have that texture like they've been rolled in a batter, on the skinny side, with just enough salt to make them irresistible. The grilled veggies (zucchini or squash, onions, roma tomatoes) are a point of contention for me. I thought they tasted great (they seem to be lightly marinated in the same sauce as the grilled chicken), but the cuts of veggies were on the small side. That is a personal preference for me, though. I would rather have a crunchy bite of zucchini in there still. THE DIPS: Oh Em Gee!! BFG rounds out their high-quality chicken with amazing, freshly made (I think they are homemade?!) dips that range from regular to wacky. Honey Mustard like I used to get in the south! you can see the mustard seeds in there! I loved it with the fries and fried ckn. BFG sauce is good, it seems to be something like a soy with a thicker base, with a little sweetness and seasonings? I can't figure it out, but its really good on the grilled chicken. Wasabi Cream! Nice Choice BFG. Talk about something different and very good! Its not overly strong (maybe they could offer a dollop of wasabi so you can change the strength? I like wasabi A LOT), its a wonderful change to a world of ketchup/ranch. Sweet Chili is another welcome change. if you like a little heat, mixed with a little sweet, this is for you! The only dip I didn't love is the Ranch, but that's another personal thing. I love buttermilk Hidden Valley Ranch (hey! i'm a southern girl) and no other. and this isn't that. but with the other dips, I don't mind! They made me a taste-test of fried mac & cheese balls, if they put that on the menu, get it! it was good (panko breaded too). All of the meals come with good garlic bread, great friendly service, and its made when you order it. So be prepared to wait about 5 minutes (worth it). I would think this would be great family stop on a weeknight or a weekend, or good take out (I'm going to try takeout sometime to see how it holds up). The place is small, like probably seats 15 people, but its definitely a place to try. Several times. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is a great place, although it looks unassuming from the outside (it's located in a strip mall just off the Strip). It has been open since 1958 and has a really great ""rat pack"" feel to it, which is appropriate considering Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Elvis, etc. came here often. Each table has a plaque behind it with a celebrity name of someone who dined at that spot; we sat at the Mickey Rooney table. Service is very professional with career waiters in tuxedos. One waiter has been there for 30 years. I had the prime rib, which is their specialty (they have a number of other beef cuts too). It was the best prime rib I have ever had...about an inch and a quarter thick and big. You will find a lot of classic steak house dishes here...tomato & blue cheese salad, creamed spinach, french onion soup, etc. All are very tasty and far more than routine. Most salads and desserts are made at your table by the waiters. The place has a very grown up vibe, not really a place for kids. Although there were a couple of people dining in shorts and t-shirts, I would advise guests to get in the spirit of the place; grow up and dress up! It's not cheap; prime rib alone is $35, add on all sides, appetizers & drinks, etc. Lobster and filet mignon combo was listed that night at $95. That said, I felt the experience was well worth it. I will definitely go back. ",0,0,0,0,1

 It's hard to critique the ""New"" Luxor for the mere fact that I have no idea what it is trying to be now. For that matter, I don't think they really have figured it out, either. The Luxor has been around since the ""theme"" casino boom a few decades back, and was at one point a really nice Egyptian themed casino. Sometime in mid/late 2008, they announced that they were going to chuck the Egyptian theme to make it all hip and trendy for the next generation of clientele. Here it is, at the beginning of 2010, and their ""grand remodeling"" thus far is underwhelming. Not that parts of the old casino style still remain scattered here and there, because it does, and you really can't hide the fact that the casino is shaped like a giant pyramid, and is a definable part of the Vegas landscape. The biggest disappointment is that the ""new"" style doesn't even try to outperform, or even merely substitute for the old look. At best, the adjectives I could muster are ""bland"", ""generic"", ""undefined"", and ""unspecific"". In a city that is designed to one-up each accomplishment with something ""bigger and better and more spectacular"". This does the complete opposite. Unless that was their plan to be so drastically unique that they would go against all conventions and expectations. In that regard, it has succeeded/failed spectacularly. The real problem is that in trying to make it so hip and trendy to the ""bro"" and ""socialite wannabe"" crowds, they are now stuck with the impending issue of when trends will change yet again, and now they are stuck with a bunch of mediocrity instead of what was some extremely well designed architecture and artistic flair. I'm sure in trying to further ""Un-Egypt"" themselves, they will no longer refer to the structure as a pyramid, and start calling it a ""pointed boobie"" in hopes that it will drag in some of the ""bro"" set. I admire the want to ""grow up"" and do things differently, but there is a difference between ""growing up"" and ""maturing"". Change some shows and restaurants as needed, but you're stuck in a giant pyramid, the ""Luxor"" name is a governing city in Egypt, and the locals can't figure out what ""Club Triangle"" is trying to do anymore. I don't know why they would work so hard to make their casino look so boring. Bad call, Luxor! Bad call! FYI: If you want to see the original ""Egypt"" part these days, the local Natural History Museum actually got a huge donation of the casino's art, so you can see what was there when Luxor had its original exhibit. Two stars for now, which will drop to one once they successfully ""un-lame"" themselves into their desired level of mediocrity. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is a new Philly cheesesteak restaurant in Arizona Mills Mall. It looks like it replaced Great Steak and Potato which used to be one of my favorite quick service restaurants in AZ Mills. Arizona Mills is doing a big food court overhaul and this seemed to be one of many new restaurants. I was not impressed. I got the buffalo chicken philly, which is what I always used to get at Great Steak. It was extremely salty and the chicken was like deli slices instead of an actual chopped up chicken breast. It was drowning in sauce and so salty I downed two waters afterwards. I realize that I should not expect a ton from a quick service restaurant in the mall but Great Steak used to make this sandwich so well and this was no where near the same quality. It took about ten minutes to get one sandwich which wasn't too bad. Overall, bad food. I will not be back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Friendly technicians. Good pedicure, but with a lot less massage than I normally like. The manicure was extremely rushed though. My cuticles were still very messy and I had paint all over my fingertips. It was a gel manicure so the paint came off my fingertips after about a day of me picking it off, but for the price I would have expected more. Both manicure and pedicure did last well though. I've had them for about a week and a half and not a single chip. I'm not from the area, so I probably won't try this place again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I moved very near this restaurant about a year and a half ago. The first time we tried it, we loved it enough to keep going back several times. The food was delicious and original -- not what you get at a typical generic americanized mexican restaurant. The place has really gone down hill a lot in a short time. The latest time we went will also probably be the last time we go. The food simply stank. Everything came with a pile of hard purple cabbage, which unlike the typical but useful pile of lettuce&tomatoes, was nothing more than garnish. (this cabbage can be seen in just about all of the photos others have posted) Dishes that had been consistently good over several visits were suddenly changed, and not for the better. My daughter's shrimp tostada thing was a portion size almost half of what it used to be, and if she's going to order something that costs more than what I order, It'd better be worth it, dammit! I know Parrilla Suiza has long been considered agreat place, and not your typical mexican restaurant, but it just isn't the case anymore. I am curious if any other former long-time customers are recently feeling the same? ",0,1,0,0,0

 aww i love this place!! got an amazing deal for my 21st birthday. we got two rooms that had the connecting door between them so me and my 7 other friends had a lot of fun! the newly renovated rooms are awesome. they definitely modernized the mirage and did a great job updating all the furniture, decor, and quality of the rooms. the service was great and theyre pretty good about letting you check-in early as long as you ask nicely =) the pool here is awesome too. its huge and we didnt have to get out there too early to find a good spot. the waterfall is a lot of fun and definitely adds to the wow-factor of the pool. ate at kokomo's for my birthday dinner, see my review on that, and also did quite a bit of gambling. they have a lott of roulette tables so if youre into that this is a good place to play since there's so many tables. definitely one of my favorite hotels, but the rates have gone up a lot since my 21st birthday... you can pay like $30 more and get a room at the encore...but i still love the mirage because it does have a great location!

 I'll just put it upfront. Given all the hype about Hakkasan and how it was going to be the Vegas club to shut down all other Vegas clubs (you can Google the story about the bitter rich guy that got shut down for a table and vowed to destroy everyone else), Hakkasan just doesn't meet the hype. Getting in itself is a pain in the ass for a multitude of reasons. First off, Hakkasan's in that ""we're the new hot new club, let's gouge everyone to death"" cover mode. $100 for guys on a big weekend is borderline obscene. But hey, they know can get away with it with suckers like me, so until some other new badass club comes around, that's just how it's going to be. Second, if you don't actually have a ticket beforehand, good luck getting in. Third, even you have your ticket or your name on a guest list, have fun with that wait. Luckily for me, I have all angles covered so this usually isn't a problem for me. Once you're in, layout is fairly simplistic. Third floor is the hip-hop floor. Fourth floor is the main/EDM floor. Fifth floor is just a balcony floor overlooking the main floor. The outside area is located...oh wait, there's no outside area here? You spent $200 million on the alleged ""best"" club in Las Vegas and you don't even have an outside area? What kinda fail is this? And this leads to the biggest issue of Hakkasan: it's just way overcrowded. Obviously they need to make their money back because they spent a ridiculous amount to build the place, then an even more obscene amount to get the top DJs to establish residency. But that's the problem, Hakkasan was clearly built to cater to those that get a table. You look around the entire dance floor, it's filled up with tables. You look at the fifth floor, the best (and realistically, only) views of the stage are if you have a table. For us mere mortals that go there every other week and aren't hood rich, you can't even move. Being on the dance floor for Hardwell, I swear the most valuable commodity available is space. Can't even really call it dancing at that point, it's just straight up being packed like sardines and MAYBE move around listlessly if you're lucky. No wonder all these people are getting their phones and wallets jacked, you're pretty much a sitting duck. Don't even get me start with the fact that the stairs leading down to the dance floor are just a hot mess once the main event act shows up. For my beating house music heart, the only reason I'd ever come here is because Ti \ u00ebsto, Hardwell, or Calvin Harris is playing. I suppose the good thing about residency is that you know they're going to play here regularly, but heyyyy the costs get passed down to us. And seriously, the light wall holds no candle to Marquee or Light, if you can even call it a light wall. I'm not gonna declare that I'd never come here again because I'm too much of a fanboy for Hardwell and Calvin Harris. But I'd much rather go to Marquee, XS, or Light, unless someone I really have to see is playing. All the other stuff isn't worth the crap I have to go through for the entire night to see one of my favorite artists playing. ",0,1,0,0,0

 3.75 stars for Boardhouse Subs. I'm rounding it up to a 4. I've never been so conflicted when writing a review before. Usually I know when I leave the restaurant what kind of experience I had. I write a pretty fair review, I think, and consider all the factors. So I'm going to break it down and write a long review because of my own internal struggles. Because as I'm writing this, I haven't selected how many stars I'm giving it. I'm going to talk myself into a rating. I've got five categories I'll rate Boardhouse in. Service - Quick, friendly cashiers never rush you or make you feel like you're an idiot for asking questions. I've only had good things to say about them. In my recent visit I had purchased a deal from LivingSocial off my Iphone. It clearly states on the app that you can print the voucher or bring in your iphone (same way Groupon works). The cashier struggled with this concept, nervous to accept anything but a printout. She balked and nearly refused me use of the credit. She ended up accepting it - good thing she did, because I would have turned around and left... and not batted an eyelash at giving them a one star rating. You simply do not allow your business to be on LivingSocial and not accept a paid-for voucher. But she accepted it after a few moments of hemming and hawing. Good for her. Quality - On the sandwich scale, about a four (out of five). MUCH better quality than Subway, or even Port of Subs. Not as good as say, Capriotti's or other specialty delis. Equally as good as some of the other 4 star sandwich shops on yelp. The turkey is roasted, sliced thick, breads are yummy, condiments fresh, etc. Price - Okay, they're overpriced. Even expensive. We picked out two bottled sodas, two bags of chips, and two whole sandwiches (you can choose whole or half portions). He got ""The Original"" with turkey and roast beef (extra charge), normal veggies, and cheese (extra charge). I got the Chicken Bruschetta. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals, but before the voucher it came to $24 something. UM, WHAT? We could eat out at a medoicre family restaurant for that. However, last time I was in Port of Subs I remember paying almost nearly this much and I wasn't as impressed... hmmm... Atmosphere - Adorable, cute little corner shop next to Albertsons. Cute decor, easy to read menu. Frequented by firemen, police, and other blue collar workers. I like this place. Clean, inviting, certainly a place I feel comfortable in. Return Business - Would I come back? If I was craving a really good hot sandwich, yes. I might gravitate more toward Heidi's Brooklyn Deli on a daily basis because of their price difference... but I'd come back here for a Chicken Bruschetta. With the deal we purchased from LS - hell yes. Added Bonuses: *** Kids Menu: Hooray for family-friendly! Three low-priced items on their kids menu. *** Frozen, chocolate covered bananas. *** Great bottled drink selection with fountain drink option. Okay, talked myself into 4 stars. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I love how this restaurant feels like a different world once you walked into it! The decor and service are A+, I was truely pleasantly surprised. To be honest, I'm really still an Indian cusine virgin. My friends knew what to order so I just went with the flow. Everything we ordered were tasty, but a little bit on the mellow side probably because I expected Indian food to be some what spicy (as in certain degree of tongue burning). I can't even begin to name the dishes, but we had a lamb chop curry dish, and chicken curry dish, and they're both really good. The chops were tender, and the spices were just right. We also had some lentile soup, that was good too. Then we had this thing that's almost like a spinach dip, except its mixed with butter/oil and chunks of Indian cheese that tasted like tofu! That's spinach dish was probably my favorite, and its actually something that's not on the menu, and my Indian cusine expert friend asked for it. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Oh Lucera. I wanted so badly to like you.... This complex is INCREDIBLY MINDBLOWINGLY LOUD. The window's are single-paned, and poorly sealed, so you hear absolutely everyone and everything. I'm on the third story and can tell you what's going on in the lives of every dog walker. I can tell you which neighbors are having relationship problems. I can tell you the landscaper is fed up with his hours, and thinks that alimony is a bunch of bs. Why must I know these things?? The loudness is compounded with the free-for-all landscaping. The landscapers are on no particular schedule, and it is not humanly possible to sleep through their visits. Sometimes it's 7am. Some days it's noon. As a person who works nights, I can tell you I haven't slept a full night since living here, and it's really starting to affect my mood and productivity. And now they're renovating the pool, so we have construction workers and heavy equipment here on random weekdays, too. Oh joy. The sound isn't even my biggest issue. Since living here, we have NEVER ONCE RECEIVED A CORRECT BILL. Not once. Rent was wrong. Tax was wrong. Utilities were wrong. Late fees from previous tenants appear and disappear in an enigmatic fashion that not even Carl Sagan could explain. One time, the planets aligned just right and they managed to get both the due date and the base rent correct. On the same bill. We rejoiced and hung it on the fridge with pride. It may sound like an exaggeration, but the problem is so bad, we've been told to simply ignore our bills, and go into the office before every month to see what fees are really due. Their billing company is incompetent, and I truly resent that they continue to contract with them at the tenant's expense. In their favor, I will say that Lucera is under new management, and their manager, Davina, is incredibly involved and competent. She communicates well, and does her best to address every issue presented, but this place is a trainwreck, and she's only one person. My issues are not with the office staff directly, but with their lack of standards for those they employ (such as landscaping, maintenance, and billing). One competent person is not enough to run a show this large, and until they can set a decent standard, I would not recommend this place to anyone. At least not anyone who enjoys sleep, and doesn't seek out overcharges for recreation. Get it together, Lucera! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Edinburgh Bicycle Coop is arguably one of the best bicycle retailers in Scotland. Discovered these folks roughly 7 years ago and they have grown and become much better over that time. They have their own brands of bikes and equipment. This stuff is field tested and improved yearly. Their Revolution bicycles are consistently rated as one of the best by Cycling Plus. The service is really good and they offer stuff that will interest everyone from serious roadies and mud-jumpers to kids. I would use them more if I lived in Edinburgh but currently I mainly use their website to order stuff and only visit twice a year. This is a blessing since i would definitely spend a lot more money if it was local. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Sorry wicked spoon but I must say the experience was a let-down. Once is enough. ============= Cons: Lamb was too gamey, I had to discreetly spit it out. Lamb looked good, I wish it tasted that way too but sadly the opposite. And I eat lamb all the time. but this one was no good. Bone marrow, another dish I wanted to like so badly but was a total fail. I guess they might have cooked it differently or more plainly that night but c'mon it was a Saturday night! Buffets are supposed to showcase their talents that time. Beef brisket with polenta: polenta was really good. beef not so much. it was dry and tasteless. gnocchi with lamb ragu: boring, bland For a Saturday night, their food selection was sparse, I saw a lot of dead space on the food displays. The dessert selection was FAR from what I saw in one of the pictures. Only the top two layers of the display had dessert on it. =============== Pros: Prime rib: tender flavorful moist mashed potatoes: best i ever tasted truffle scalloped potatoes: loved it but i wish it wasnt too filling chicken wings: just right ceviche: so-so but i ate 2 servings of this mainly to clean my palate somewhat pistacchio gelato and salted caramel vanilla gelato: heavenly Service: the best buffet service ================= I wanted to like this place but after thinking about my overall experience, there's a reason why, for a Saturday night, there were no lines anywhere in this buffet. Most of the items I liked were side dishes and dessert and the Cons I experienced were dishes that were supposed to be those center-stage. For the value of your money, it's not worth it. The decor was nice and the food looked nice but you can't eat these things and you're in a buffet, you come here to eat your heart out. I wish they'd spend more time improving the taste of all their dishes instead of the decor. Next time I'll hit the Bacchanal instead. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is a hit or miss when it comes to getting your food made correctly. I would say the last 3 times I have eaten here, they have messed up my order, wow! My husband does take out here often and they had the incorrect pick time even though he repeated it 3 times over the phone. I think PF Chang's really needs to take a look at the company they use for call in orders. I believe it's a 3rd party company that takes the phone orders. I gave this location 4 stars because the service has always been stellar, besides the cooks making my food extra spicy instead of NOT spicy. Its situated at Kierland, so you can take a nice stroll after you fill up on too much Pad Thai. Overall, I do enjoy coming here once and a while. A major plus for me is they offer a dairy-free menu!!! This makes it easy for me to pick and choose what I can eat. Just ask your server and they will print if off for you. I think the happy hour is great as well. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We came here last night for a quick bite to eat. We sat in the bar area. It was during the NBA finals--the bar was understaffed. The menus were filthy. The tables were not stocked -- no sugar carafe, no salt. My table seemed washed off however it was very sticky. Food was fair. Service was obviously slow/poor due to staffing. Someone in the kitchen area was cleaning a vent on the ceiling, not the appropriate time. So in my opinion, this place needs some management. ",0,1,0,0,0

 ""BEST ANNIVERSARY VACATION EVER!!!!"" This hotel packs luxury and personal touch better then some of the larger hotels in on the strip that claim to do so. The contemporary decor to the trendy cocktail lounge""Stir"" made our stay in Vegas the best as of yet. Rooms are incredible! from full kitchen to spacious tub, if your looking on spending some quality time with you special person. The staff was second to none!!! Attentive housekeeping, front desk and Valet. They provide a comfort and friendly environment that made things more relaxing. We tried the spa (Well Spa). My wife and I both agreed that if we live in Vegas we would frequent the spa more even if we were not staying here.

 I've been here on multiple occasions while I was in Madison, and I love this place! There is a very good selection of meats, and the salad bar is also really great. The cheese bread is delicious! My favorite cut is the top sirloin, it's tender, juicy, and so flavorful! And as others have mentioned, the grilled pineapple is definitely a must-have, make sure you ask the server to cut you a slice coated with brown sugar, it's sweet and tangy with a smokey flavor. My friends and I love it so much we tried to make it at home once, and it definitely didn't turn out as good. I've also been here for Restaurant Week, and the meat selection is also really decent for the reduced price. The servers are really friendly, and we were seated promptly with reservation. We always have a really good time here, and the restaurant atmosphere is suitable for both semi-formal or casual events. Love it! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I'm from LA so I couldn't help but compare with Boiling Point in the 626 when I came here. Pot Tea was good and cheap but I think I like BP better. We arrived a little before 5pm on Saturday (12/27/14) and it was empty! I was scared because I chose this location for my boyfriend's family to try since I love hot pot. They ended up enjoying it so yay! Unlike BP's hour wait, we had no wait here. Perfect. A lot more people arrived after us and the place began to fill up. FOOD: My bf and I had the ($20) Lobster Hot Pot. It was good. The shells were pre-cracked so it was easy to open (I think). He didn't let me open it. We got minced pork rice with it, but I wish all the pots came with noodles already like BP. He can't handle spicy, so they gave me a spicy soup base on the side. Nice! So I adjusted the spiciness in my bowl to my liking. Unless you're really hungry, one pot is good enough to share between two people. They refill your broth if you need it. His parents has the rib-eye hot pot and they seemed to enjoy it. Price is actually a bit cheaper than BP. Popcorn chicken was yummy. Needed a dipping sauce though. SAUCE: The two sauces are a Ponzu sauce and a chili bean paste(?) sauce. They were good but I like BP's side sauces better. TEA: SO GOOD! I'm spoiled by LA's tea shops, but I enjoyed this. I got the lychee black tea and it was delicious. I believe the waitress said their tea were imported from Taiwan(?). BF got mango green tea and it was yummy but I liked my choice better. His dad got a tea latte and it looked really good. Wish I got to try it! SERVICE: Service was wonderful. Since we were first and it was less crowded, service was very attentive and nice. The waiter and waitress were really helpful since it was our first time there. She explained things thoroughly and said we could sub things in our hot pot if we wanted, which is something you can't do at BP! The Filipino waiter said something to me in Tagalog (possibly thank you) because I guess I blended in with my bf's family haha. He was very polite to my bf's parents. Basically, they were great! It was a different experience from LA's Boiling Point; I enjoyed it. Loved the no wait!! Like the other reviewer said, they're both different and they're both good. And don't forget a stamp card if you're a Vegas local! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have been Dr. Tsai's patient for about four years now, and I love everything about his office and practice. I grew up in a family that never had a 'family doctor' and always spent hours waiting in Quick Care, but as an adult that really didn't appeal to me. Over the years I have seen him for a variety of reasons (trouble breathing, flu, cold, cough, head pain, check ups and lab work), and he always takes the time to listen and take me seriously. I recently wanted some bloodwork done just to check something out, which he ordered no problem. When I told my mom - a former nurse - she was so surprised that a doctor was willing to listen to what I was worried about and order the labs for me. The absolute best thing about his office is how easy it is to get in for an appointment. Usually it is that day or the next day. My last visit was a 48 hour wait, and when I told him about it he was surprised, apologized, and asked me who I talked to. In office I usually wait less than 15 minutes to get in the room and maybe 5 minutes in the room. I also love that I don't have to fill out paperwork EVERY. TIME. I. GO. I did it the first time, and he keeps all files electronically (which means when I complained about a symptom that is new he was easily able to confirm that with his own electronic notes.)

 Awesome, honest guy. Took my car in today because I thought I needed my brake pads replaced. He took a look at them with me there and let me know that it looked like I still had some life in them but he would put the car on the lift to check the brake pads on the inside. He confirmed that I still had a few thousand miles left in them and that it was safe to drive. Never had a mechanic not try to sell me on something. I appreciate him saving me the money for now. I will definitely be going back to him for all future needs. Word of advice, there is no sign out front and it's a one man shop so call first to set an appt if you can. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This is one of the few Starbucks locations that does not make me want to be extra cautious about not sitting or putting my stuff down on sticky chairs or tables nor make me want to stick my head outside to escape the overpowering scent of coffee beans and gasp for fresh air. Like all Starbucks locations, it provides a fairly comfortable atmosphere. The walls are adorned with shelves of Starbucks and Teavana products for us to glance over and momentarily display an inkling of interest before being ushered down to the cashier and being asked how our day is and what we would like to have. Free Wi-Fi is always a plus (and, really, a given for any coffeeshop). I greatly prefer this location over the ones in Oakland, which are prone to having long lines, dirty tables, and curious clients sleeping on tables or couches. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I freaking love Rodizio Style Brazillian Churrasco! Texas de Brazil is tasty and the service is phenomenal. Don't overload on the orgasmic cheese bread or the freshtastic sides because the MEAT is where it's at! My favorites are the bacon wrapped filet, flank, and the ribs. The only downside to this spot is that they don't do the rodizio pineapple that they have at most other Brazillian bbq spots and the fried banana is soft all the way through instead of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Those things are minor in the grand scheme of things. This is a great spot for a large group, or just for a date. The ambience justifies the price. If you're looking for a less trendy rodizio experience check out YOLIES on Paradise. That place is LEGIT! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Two words: amazing mussels. I have had many a moule frites in my life, but this place probably ranks in the top three for me. The mussels are plump and juicy and the broth is perfectly made -- full of flavour but not overwhelming the taste of the mussels. I was sopping it up with bread the whole way through. I tried the steak as well, but it wasn't anything particularly outstanding for me. Fair warning though, if you're tempted by both the steak and the seafood option, don't go for the surf and turf! The quality of the seafood in the surf and turf is not as good as individual orders of seafood for some reason, so I'd highly suggest just sharing two mains with your dinner partner and getting the best of both worlds.

 It's probably been 8 years since we last tried out the Garden Court Buffet. We had fond memories of it from previous visits. I don't know what has happened, but our breakfast buffet was extremely disappointing. It's one of the most inexpensive breakfast buffets you will find in Las Vegas. It's only $8. But even for that price, we wouldn't go back again. The coffee was the worst we've ever had. It was served in plastic mugs and was very watery. I could barely drink it. The orange juice was almost as bad. We tried a variety of items. We were disappointed with everything except the omelet, coconut donut, and cinnamon rolls. We arrived around 8:30 am on a weekday morning in early April and there was no line. When we left around 9:30, there was still no line. So, I think it's safe to say you won't have to wait to get into this breakfast buffet. Conclusion: If you have very low expectations, you might not be disappointed by this breakfast buffet. For the same price, we found the breakfast buffet at the Orleans to be better. Of all the buffets we went to during our 5-day stay, this was by far the worst. If you want an absolutely scrumptious dining experience, you must try the breakfast buffet at the Wynn or the Wicked Spoon. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Wir waren heut zu dritt dort und ich war sehr begeistert. Problemlose Tischreservierung. Wundersch \ u00f6nes, garnicht kitschiges Ambiente. Freundliche Bedienung. Wir haben uns einen Vorspeisenteller geteilt, welcher reichlich und gut war. Ich hatte ein rotes Thaicurry, welches eine wunderbar angenehme Sch \ u00e4rfe hatte und sehr gut geschmeckt hat. Meine Begleitung hatte eine Suppe, welche sehr gut war, die andere Dame hatte Nudeln mit Shrimps etc. Alles sah sehr gut und frisch aus und schmeckte hervorragend. Zum Dessert habe ich mir gebackene Banane geteilt. Dies war auch kein Problem, wir bekamen entsprechend 2 Bestecke dazu. Zur Rechnung gabs die obligatorischen Schn \ u00e4pse und Gl \ u00fcckskekse. Rechnungstrennung war kein Problem und alles korrekt. Die WC Anlagen sind schlicht, aber sauber, hier k \ u00f6nnte es f \ u00fcr Rollifahrer Probleme geben. Allerdings ansonsten durchaus behindertengeeignet. Kartenzahlung kein Problem. Erreichbar am Besten per Bahn bis Postgalerie/Kaiserstr. oder ab ins Parkhaus.

 I love the concept of this place, food drink and free games. There's value there because you can spend A lot playing games at places like Dave n Busters. Let's get to the food, I had the trout. It was topped with green beans almonds and onions, what a nice combination of flavors. The fish was cooked just right, it was moist and I enjoyed every bite. Another memorable thing from my dinner here is they have these mystery brown paper bag beers for $1.50. You never know what beer you will get (icehouse was one of them) but this is a great deal!

 The Baked Potato Shop really does have the best baked potatoes ever. No joke, ever. It was an amazing find when I was a student because I could make two meals out of the BP, easy. They're huge! (admittedly, I eat a lot more now, so it's just one meal for me these days) As far as I am aware they only have veggie toppings. I'm a meat eater but have no problem with veggie food and when it comes to a BP even prefer the veggie stuff. Every time I eat here I choose the three bean topping with cheese. The beans are cold, unfortunately, which means that the cheese doesn't melt, but it doesn't even matter; the taste is phemonenal. My only gripe is that they have space for about two people to sit in which means that every time I've been here I've had to find a place to sit and eat my meal somewhere around the Mile. That is fine in nice weather, but we're in Scotland here, and nice weather doesn't come around that often. But, they work with what they have and do a fantastic job of it. I'll definitely be coming here next time I have a few after work pints in that region, because I am craving a baked potato now. ",0,0,0,0,1

 The food was solid. Nice chips and salsa, not too rich of beans, and the right amount of cheese. Ordered chorizo and eggs, bean and cheese burrito, carne asada tostada and an enchilada (just because we have to try an enchilada everywhere). Chorizo and eggs - good but not great Bean and Cheese burrito - not overly filled, so it could have had more Carne asada - Excellent! Enchilada - a very good enchilada (not on the menu, so make sure to ask) The only problem was the service. There were only 2 people working, and the woman didn't speak english well enough so the chef had to come out and take orders. So he was obviously very busy and missed the side of rice we ordered. No fault to his own, he was doing everything, but it was something to note. We were thinking that maybe she fits more with the spanish speaking neighborhood, but for us it made it a little difficult to order. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Loved this place!! Came back to Madison for Wisconsin fare, and that's exactly what I got. Started the night off with well, an old fashioned; Wisconsin-style with Korbel. That's the way my parents drink em', so I thought I'd give the old stand by a try. It was most delicious! The drink was made well--very sweet and with real fruit. Yum! Moved on to some local delicacies--a pickled turkey gizzard (not worth the chewing), and a PBR with a spicy pickled egg in it. They served that to me in a chalace, it was pretty wonderful and disgusting. Their local beer selection was excellent. We tried some local porters and IPAs.

 ""My name is Barack Obama and I approve this restaurant."" - The President of the United States Alright, so I totally made up that quote, although it is true that Obama did make a stop at Pamela's while visiting Pittsburgh and loved it. But even though I voted for the guy, I can't say that I'm with him on this one. Pamela's is just okay. Pretty much everything on the menu is standard and over-the-top greasy. Even their so-called famous hotcakes fail to dazzle my taste buds, and I can assure you that my taste buds are not particularly discriminating, especially during the time that I lived in Pittsburgh as a broke college student.

 This place has to be the worst as far as customer service and timing. The 1st time I came here I bought 1 smoothie and a juice totalled to be $13.21. Instead I was charge $1300.21. If I didn't check my bank statement I would have never known. When I went to have it corrected no one knew what to do so it took 2 days for staff to figure out how to fix the situation. I got a $50 gc for waiting 2 hrs while they tried to fix it. I again came back to purchase using my gc and every time I go it it takes over 30 mins to get a smoothie. It's never completely packed. Last week I ordered a Pitaya bowl and the person making it clearly didn't look at the ticket and made an acai tropical bowl. So I asked if they had different products and she said oh I'm sorry I thought it was something else. Took 30 mins. Then a couple ordered and another staff member came from the back sucking on her fingers from eating something in the back, didnt wash her hands just put gloves on and made 2 bowls. Being in the health profession I was highly disgusted. Today I'm on my lunch break and I place my order and the cashier asked if it was ok if it would take 25-30 mins on my smoothie and Pitaya bowl I said no not really why are ticket orders so long and her response was ""Idk that's a good question."" Mmmm ok if you know this is a constant issue why is it not being addressed. I wasted my whole hour lunch break waiting on a smoothie and a bowl for 45 mins. I just don't understand. Nothing is being cooked. Are you under staffed, don't have enough blended or just don't care? There was 2 ppl before. I just feel like the errors made are preventable and ticket times are so long because of not paying attention.. I'd hate to see the food cost at this location. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is extremely overpriced and overrated. My companion and I ordered a whole fish to share (the salted, baked fish). At $57/lb, I thought it would be pretty special. Alas, we got back was nothing beyond standard, doused in lemon butter with capers, like you'd get most anywhere. The fish itself (a red snapper) did not offend but was wholly unremarkable. I've had better elsewhere for a fraction of the price. The menu is a la carte, so don't expect any sides with that either. We got some fried potatoes to that end, which turned out of be a small amount of thick-cut fries, for $12. Even though I expected a pretty big bill, I didn't expect such mediocre food and small portions. The ambiance was a melange of upscale and trendy. No doubt, many patrons were trying to impress one another, which is inconsequential to me, except as entertainment (perhaps, for this, I give a star?). (Collagen to the left of them, silicon to the right of them! Volley and thunder!) The service was brusque, and often inattentive. The guy who refilled the water and the bread was far better than our actual waiters (yes, there were two). In summary, even though I expected a rather big bill, I couldn't help leave feeling I'd been suckered, not to mention a bit hungry, at paying more than top dollar for average, insufficient food. I don't mind paying good money for an awesome experience, but this was not it, and I couldn't help but compare to much better meals I've had, with better service, for less. Do not go here unless you have the appetite of a model and the, uh, patron to pay for you. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place never ceases to amaze me. The staff, service and food was incredible. Let me mention the service- it was a Sunday evening and not too crowded, our group of 6, I have to admit we were a pain in the ass.......we DID have reservations, 1/3 of our party were running late (OK, it was me).....CPH not a problem. Then when we finally all get there drinks at the bar chit chatting away...our table is ready. We don't want to sit there, we want outside....CPH not a problem. Ok, so it was another 20 minute wait, now we are getting kind of hungry, so we sit at our original table and order appetizers, but wait 2/3 of the party still want outside sitting!!! CPH not a problem. An outside table for 6 is finally available so they move us (Ahhh....2 tables over), we get our appetizers and lucky for us we still get to keep our fabulous server and FINALLY the group is content. The food was fabulous! I love going out with foodie friends because we all ordered something different from the menu. We started with the original chopped salad and pork bellies and they were delicious! Dinner, we basically order everything from the pan seared scallops, buttermilk chicken, meatloaf the fish and short ribs were all excellent! Everything was absolutely delicious.

 Found this place on yelp. Was a little skeptical about all the mixed reviews, but glad I went. The food was amazing. The chicken in the dishes was real chicken. Not that weird rubbery fake chicken. We ordered Thai beef jerky, mint chicken, Thai chicken fried rice, crab rangoons, mangolian beef, Thai ice tea and Thai coffee. Everything was great. The place was very clean n the service was great. We went on a Friday at 4pm and were the only ones there. Go and try it out if you live close by. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Anyone familiar with Sonny's BBQ (a southern chain) will immediately notice the similarity. This is not a good thing. Salad bar was ok. Not a lot of great variety. I had the 1/2 rack of ribs with slaw and fries. The slaw and fries were fine. Nothing special but not bad. The garlic bread, soaked in buttery garlic, also was fine. Probably the best part of the meal. The ribs, on the other hand, could use some work. First, they were covered in SO MUCH SAUCE, that I had to hold them up to let some drip off. Sauce should provide an accent to good BBQ, not be the BBQ. Second, the doneness of the meat varied across the ribs. One rib was fall of bone. Further down, it was closer to jerky. All in all, not a great BBQ experience. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Man, I hate to hate on local business, but this was truly an awful experience. I notified their ""info"" section of their website of the complaints listed herein and received a canned response in return. I hope that my listing my bad experience on Yelp will help them improve their business model and service. My mom and I walked in at 11:45 to Mix N Mac. Both of us being something of macaroni and cheese connoisseurs, we were excited to try it out and had been for a while. When we walked in, it was silent with only a couple people in the restaurant who were already eating. I really hate the trend in the service/retail industry right now that requires the workers to holler out across the entire establishment, ""WELCOME TO _____!!!! CAN I HELP YOU TODAY!??"" I mean, we're in a building the size of a household living room, there's no need to bellow. But I digress. We looked over the menu, and picked two Lil Mac (kids' size), which includes, and I quote, ""1 Mix-In."" Thinking that the mix-in that was included was listed underneath the menu section called ""Mix-Ins,"" I selected spinach for my mix-in. I also selected Dorito topping for my mac. Later, I realized I had been charged for spinach, and I asked why. Apparently, a Dorito topping is also a mix-in, even though the menu makes it look like the topping is included. Be mindful of this when ordering! It's important to note that Mix N Mac is in the style of Panera or Chipotle, just with macaroni and cheese. Quick service, but not drive-thru. We placed our order at 11:52 (according to the timestamp on our receipt). For 15 minutes or more, no one was working on our food. There was a woman stirring a cauldron of cheese sauce, one teenage boy standing at the register for customers that weren't there, and another was chopping up meat that I knew couldn't be for our meal because we did not order meat in our Macs. I had an appointment to get to, so at this time I asked for it to go. At this point is when all hell broke loose. A storm of people came in, all the while the woman stirring the cauldron of cheese without helping the two teenagers prepare food, and they aren't even really doing that. My mac and cheese arrived around 12:20, and I had a few bites. It was, to be honest, slightly fishy like another reviewer had said. There wasn't so much as cheese flavor as it was cheesy-fish flavor. There was hardly any spinach that I had paid extra for due to the confusing menu, and I couldn't even taste the Dorito topping. The key part of the paragraph above is that I got my order, but my mom's was mysteriously not arriving with mine. The people who ordered 10 minutes after me and my mom got their food before she did. I was going to be late for this appointment, so she ran out with it in a to-go bag. At 12:31, we left this quick-service mac and cheese establishment not having even sat down to eat. I will give it another try in a few months, once they get a chain of command worked out and realize that prep work like stirring the cauldron of cheese and chopping meats should not be done during high lunch time. I feel really bad leaving such a bad review, but this place was not worth our 40 minutes or our $15. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I think this may be the best restaurant near the U of I. Standard Italian food, but some wonderful improvisations in addition. I don't know where they get their seafood, but the swordfish is the best I've ever had. Also pastas, steaks, and great vegetables - they are committed to organic ingredients. Spend a few hours and taste a few appetizers before dinner. Reasonably comprehensive wine list and full bar. Cordial service, but they keep it leisurely, so let them know if you've got a curtain later. The owner comes around to make sure you feel well cared-for. Note: they serve lunch M-F from 11:30 until 3. Dinner begins at 5 p.m. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Wtf!? Who puts disgusting, processed American cheese on a sub sandwich!? Every time I go back to this place, it gets worse. For...the...love...of...God... This is why I'm scared to go out for lunch in Phoenix. Nobody seems to have a clue about what you should and shouldn't do. Also, the bread. Why choose a bread that has millions of tiny sesame seeds? Hmm? No bueno. Hey, Hero Factory, the 80s called. They love your cheese. The rest of us, not so much. I paid about $11.00 for this awesome sub and a small bag of chips. If you appreciate it when people flaunt their right to wear a gun in public, then this is the place for you. However, if you want some decent food, I would avoid the Hero Factory. They get 2-stars for quick service and good jalapeno potato chips. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Had an awesome time here at breakfast. Its an old school diner. Juke boxes at the table and everything! We got the breakfast special which was 3 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 bacon and hash browns. It was only $3.99! I got a heath bar shake and my buddy got coffee. The heath bar shake was awesome! They hook it up too by that they give you the shake, plus the leftovers in the metal shake container. So its like 2 shakes in one. It was kind of hard to suck through the straw because they put sooooooo much heath bar in there but I wasn't complaining......I love heath bars!

 Disappointed. I've definitely had better. Was extremely excited at first to treat my mother and friend to a nice girls-out-to-brunch while visiting over the weekend and turned out to be undistinctive and bleak.

 I came here for my birthday dinner... It was early evening Saturday, so there was no wait and we just ate at the bar with a view of the pool to my left. The waitstaff was super friendly, attentive and helpful. She even took the time to describe in detail how things were prepared. We ordered two sushi rolls (spider and philly and edamame)...it was all great. But the edamame is really superb. Really. They even gave us complimentary birthday shots...what more can a girl ask for? Oh yeah...the meal was free because I was staying at the hotel and I was given a $50 credit to the restaurant. Awesome. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Restaurant has a great feel and look. Outside patio is massive with lots of seats and things to do. Staff was very attentive, but not hovering. We had an assortment of apps, entrees, and dessert. Food was top notch and watching the chefs prepare it in the show kitchen was really cool. This would be a great place for happy hour or a night out with friends. I heard somebody talk about them having live music, but not sure of the bands or schedule. The crowd was pretty mixed with respect to age and demographic, but everyone was having a good time.

 The wash isn't anything special and the place is gross! I've had my car washed at the Scottsdale location an it is far better. While it is a 'and wash', the car moves along an old track system and not the conveyor style at the Scottsdale location - so watch your wheels! This location appears to be a conversion from another wash company but it looks like it happened 20 years ago and is in dire need of an update. It's old, tired, dated, dirty and nasty.

 Finally had a chance to make it over to the new location--pretty awesome! For what it's worth, I think they are, without a doubt, the best brewery in the entire state. Cool digs, free pool and great beer. They had a one-off on tap when I went--a very drinkable session beer which (I think) was classified as a Belgian pale ale. It was nice, had subtle hints of coriander and orange, and was totally delicious. Ballistic was the standout--you know, because IPAs are where they shine. I will absolutely go back for food. Until then--Ale Asylum's brews will continue to remain in my fridge. ",0,0,0,1,0

There was a short wait; however it was just after noon on a Sunday. We could not have asked for a better server and the food is great as well as reasonably priced. We enjoyed our covered outdoor seating, I did think the inside was a slight bit noisy but once again it was lunchtime on a Sunday. We had 2 small children with us and were accommodated without a problem. This will be a regular brunch place for us and I look forward to trying lunch and dinner here. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Come for the view and then leave to go dancing somewhere else. We visited on a Saturday night. Walking through the Casino we were handed two discount coupons for the club. We arrived about 9:30 and weren't charged the cover which was nice. We went upstairs and as I expected that early it was relatively empty. It was filled up more by the time we left around 11:30. There is NO seating. Every booth inside and outside was reserved for bottle service. There was a couple of benches and stools by the stairway from the steakhouse and one booth right at the front that were not reserved. Outside on the deck, which is supposed the dance floor, they've put more booths for bottle service that take up half the deck. So when everyone crowds out there to see the view there is essentially no where to dance. When we left at 11:30 not one of the bottle service tables had anyone sitting at it. Go check out the view but don't plan on much else. Expect to stand. The crowd is definitely mixed age. I saw mid 20's up to early 50's. Also, the dress code is a joke. Don't bother. I saw people in jeans, t-shirt and tennis shoes and even one guy in shorts. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Wow, this place has quite a few bad reviews! I've been to this location a few times and I have always been pleased with the outcome. They provide a discount to ASU students, so that's always a plus! Also, I have a truck, but they charge me for a standard size car. The first time I went, I was a little confused about all the packages, but the owner explained each of them to me and suggested which package was best for me based on what I told him I wanted done. I thought this was great customer service. My most recent visit, I purchased one of their frequent wash cards, which provides 10 washes and 2 waxes. It is a really big savings for those who cannot stand to have a dirty car. I have recommended this place to a couple friends, who have also had good experiences. I'd much rather support this Mom & Pop car wash over Danny's! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Hohum food. Nothing special here except the view. Great spot for drinks and snacks. Patio seating during cool months. # server actually warning me *against* what I asked for. Thanks a lot, but it's not a good sign. new chef needed? # sharp scampi drowning in wine. Blechy sauce reminds me of cheap gloppy Chinese lobster sauce. shrimps bouncy, approaching rubbery. # Chicken Caesar blabla nothing special at all # pasta served cool. Sauce greasy and not fresh. I can have cold-food-leftovers-style at home, GODDAMIT! # meatball sandwich uninspired, hohum. Service was attentive despite other reviews here, but the pace was empty.

 This review is based on our experience with a comedy show in the Plaza showroom. We purchased tickets online and were instructed to pick them up at Will Call. A word to the wise: Will Call is located at the concierge desk, which is next to the front desk, a brisk walk away from the showroom. This may have been the case for this show only, but our tickets were not actually at Will Call; they were being held, along with everyone else's at the door to the showroom. It took a lot of walking and being misdirected, but we eventually got into the venue. Another word to the wise: this place is teeny tiny. Maybe 250-300 people max. The seating is arranged almost exactly like the South Point showroom: the front area has long tables radiating out from the stage, while the back section has round booths. It seems like this is the go-to arrangement for a venue with a semi-circle stage, but all it gives the audience is a bad viewing angle and a sore neck. There is nothing special about the venue itself. Typical Vegas, with a gold ceiling, giant chandeliers and red velvet booths. On this occasion, it seems like the show was vastly oversold, leading the ushers to pull chairs from wherever they could and seat people in the aisles. Kind of a bummer. A tip: there is drink service within the venue, but it's by waitress, so it can be slow and the waitress (just the one, mind you) covered maybe half the venue. While it is ""technically"" against the rules, there doesn't seem to be any restriction on bringing drinks from the casino bar into the showroom. While I don't know how much of our experience was due to an outside company running the show itself, the experience was meh. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was very surprised by this place. It's kind of tucked away in the corner of the strip mall it resides in and the sign doesn't draw much attention but thanks to Yelp, we found it. The surprise for me was the gluten free options. They were very tasty! We've been back several times and the servers know me by drink :) So far, everything I have ate has been delicious. The only thing I would change is the portion size on some of the dishes but that's just cuz I have a big appetite, it's tasty and I want more. Fortunately, that is usually solved by going during ""Halfy Hour"" where EVERYTHING on the menu is half price (and yes, I order two. Kinda defeats the whole half thing but whatever). Good food, great service and lots of gluten free options. You can't go wrong with Tryst. ",0,0,0,1,0

 In our never ending quest to find some good Chinese in the valley we tried Eest Asian Bistro based off of the positive Yelp reviews. Our family of four ordered the following: Mongolian Beef Sweet and Sour Prawns General Tso's Chicken Combination Fried Rice Overall the food was good, not great but better than a lot we have had in the valley. However, one issue ruined the entire meal and I can't figure out why a place like this would scrimp on this when everything else was of good quality... The General Tso's Chicken used chicken waste parts (skin, tough thin meat, fat, etc.) and the meat was extremely tough and tasted like chicken fat. The meat was so tough you couldn't cut it with a fork and so you would put the whole piece in your mouth and have to chew and chew before you could swallow as it was so tough and had terrible flavor. The sauce was good but the taste of the chicken fat ruined it. My wife and daughter had to spit theirs out and I could only handle two pieces so we threw it all away. When two servers came and asked if everything was ok I told them both that the meat on the General Tso's was very tough and tasted terrible and neither of them said a word and walked away. If it wasn't for that issue we would go back, however, that ruined it for us and my wife and daughter would not even consider going back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 OMG! So excited my girlfriend introduced me to this place last night. Unbelievable. I'm sad to say I ate every piece of my 10"" pie, but SO worth it! I'm a simple girl and since I'm trying this place out for the first time I wanted to keep my order simple and basic. My pizza -- I got pepperoni, olives and roasted garlic. Holy smokes that garlic was amazing!!! The pizza was mouth-watering delicious. Everything tasted fantastic and that garlic I'm still dreaming about! We also ordered the Chopped Salad and this was also just as delicious. I think when I come here for a lunch I'll just get the large chopped salad. They mix and toss it for you, which is how I love my salads. I'm definitely going to become a regular and kudos for them and their business. This is a winner and can't wait to come back!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I am not one for hyped-up restaurants, but i had a friend in town that really wanted to go check out everything the Sugar Factory had to offer. We went around 8pm on Friday night and got sat immediately. We were greeted by our server Matt right away and he showed us the ""specialty"" drink menu and then gave us a few minutes to decide what we wanted. The drinks all sounded good but considering my sister and I don't eat sugar, we couldn't have any and they were VERY expensive. The menu is comparable to the Cheesecake Factory, with all the different choices, so it was hard to decide. We finally decided on a steak sandwich, which my friend said was awesome. My sister got the bacon and blue cheese burger, she enjoyed it and I got the open faced tuna sandwich. Mine was good but very overpriced, $14, for one small scoop of tuna, but whatever, it's a restaurant on the strip, what can you do?! The service from Matt was GREAT!! Never pushy, very funny and honest about everything on the menu that we asked about. The music was loud but other than that our experience was great. We also didn't try any desserts, because of the whole sugar issue but one day we will! We also were introduced to another server, Jake, because we were saying we saw his name in another Yelp review, he was very nice and funny. The hostesses seemed kinda of lost and we had 3 different managers come up to ""table touch"" to make sure everything was OK. (that was kinda of weird) But it is a new restaurant. I would go back if I have company in town that wants to go down there and I also recommend it for tourists. All in all it was a fun night out. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I stayed at the Omni William Penn Hotel for only one night while on business. The hotel itself is very nice, there is a restaurant and a Starbucks in the lobby. The room was amazing!

I was impressed with the towels, they were a little on the thin a scratchy side, but they were big - large enough to wrap up in them!

 At 1pm on a Wednesday we were the only customers. Service was friendly, but slow. The 2 servers/manager were too busy chatting on the phone in the back or eating their own lunch. Another group departing as we came in seemed to be waiting at the front counter for about 10 minutes for the girl in the office to finish her phone call and close their tab. Food was good, reasonably priced for a lunch combo with more than enough food. 3 of us ordered the lunch special (2 vegetarian, 1 chicken) which were all good, although the heat level was off. The 2 vegetarians asked for heat level 3 (offered range of 1-10) while the chicken was requested as a 9. Both came out around a 5. Why bother asking if you're not going to follow through. Portions were good but oddly served. Lunch combo includes salad, chutneys, rice, naan, entree, side, and desert. For our group of 3 we were served 2 bowls of rice and 2 pieces of naan. We didn't run out, so it was ok, but seemed odd when everything else was served in individual dishes. We had to ask for the salad and chutneys which were forgotten. Masala Chai tea (which to me is the barometer of quality for any restaurant) was just ok. Too much fennel/anise flavor, and too thick/heavy being made with a lot of whole milk. I checked in on yelp (which is how I found the place, after my first choice and favorite Udupi turned out to be closed/out of business!). Yelp specified it was open for lunch, and offered a $15 for $25 coupon, which I purchased. It wasn't until the end of the meal and attempting to pay that I was rudely told the promo wasn't valid with the lunch special. I told her that wasn't mentioned in the terms, she made some excuse and wandered off. I decided I'd just take it up with Yelp later, and put my card in the folio. Unfortunately she disappeared and after about 10 minutes of waiting I tracked her down in the office behind the hostess stand, knocking on the door and interrupting her personal phone call. At that point I was getting upset. with the service and called her out on the yelp promo, insisting that the only restrictions are that it's not valid for takeout or on Fridays/Saturdays. She disagreed but finally said she'd honor it and wrote down the promo code and adjusted my bill. Overall the food was good but service was unacceptable. Portions and prices if ordering the lunch combo were reasonable but ala-carte and dinner menu pricing were excessive and the portions are probably the same judging by other reviews. I would not return given the variety of other Indian options in the area. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I had a horrible experience at the Marquee Day Club with its small pool and their fantastic ability to stuff people in like sardines. There's nothing better than to come to a spacious pool, good looking people, and best of all: you don't even have to try to look good. Just grab a drink and relax in the pool, pot belly goes under water folks ;), and waddle in the water to good music. If you come with a bad ratio of guys and girls (bad, meaning that having men in your group diminish your chances of getting in for free), I would recommend contacting a promoter about your ratio and then come very early, before noon, to avoid the $50-$60 cover charge for men. But generally, girls get in for $30 if you can't get in for the promotion price. Oh, and if you're worried about fitting your lunch plans prior to pool time, they have a grill there that serves food. Drinks are fairly expensive, as they regularly are in Las Vegas clubs. The only thing to complain: I know the pools are heated, but the water is slightly too warm for the amount of people, which makes me think that the water is warm for other reasons :( But I definitely would do this again on my next trip(s), Summa Summa time! - Will Smith http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtDseXwpJ0U ",0,0,0,1,0

We had pork fried rice, pepper steak with steamed rice, cream cheese won tons, and barbecued pork strips. We thoroughly enjoyed the won tons, the pepper steak, and the steamed rice. We thought the pork fried rice was absolutely delicious. We weren't impressed with the barbecued pork strips. Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely be eating from Cook On Wok again.

 I feel kind of bad giving this place two stars....no actually, not really. First, The kitchen was completely understaffed. I came in for dinner on Sunday night with 3 others and our total dinner time took us almost 2 hours. I asked our server to bring everything out together but our dishes came individually with about 10-15 minutes in between. We pretty much had no other choice but to share, which we do anyway, but I wanted all of our food to come at once. Second, The servers were really nice but lacked communication. Example: My party had finished our second dish and was waiting for our third. One of the servers came to pick it up and asked if we wanted any dessert. She was very polite, but where was our food..........? Third, there was only ONE dish that was good. Here's what we ate: Kobe Beef Carpaccio: The quality of the meat itself was great. I would've liked it if it had been cut a little thinner though. The dish as a whole was a little inconsistent. Some parts had too much or too little of one thing or another. The Parmigiano Reggiano was also a little too mild for my taste. Uni Tomato Cream Spaghetti: This dish is that ONE good dish I was talking about. This dish was delightful. They didn't go cheap on the uni, and the uni was fresh. The tomato cream was nice and light. The spaghetti was perfectly al dente. Kurobuta Tonkatsu: The sauce was watery and bland. The meat itself needed more seasoning as well. I liked that they put cheese inside of it, but this dish was a complete fail. Very disappointed seeing how this dish was featured in one of their articles. Fettuccine Prosciutto Carbonara: I literally had to force this down. I was the most unhappy with this dish because it took the longest and tasted the worst. The pasta was undercooked and tasted like it had been boiled in unsalted water. The sauce had NO FLAVOR. The only thing OK about this dish was the prosciutto. The chef obviously didn't taste this dish when he/she sent it out of the kitchen. My boyfriend who *ISN'T A FOODIE* said, ""I could've made something better than this..."" and as much as I love him, his cooking is..not as good as most other people I've met? ;) I am very unhappy with my experience at this restaurant. I was really excited when I looked this place up and my mouth started watering when I saw the photos and read the reviews. I wish I could've had as good of an experience as all the other Yelpers. I guess it was just a bad day for this place. But you know what, consistency is one of the most important things in a successful restaurant. That is all I have to say. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I really like China A Go Go. The only complaint I have is I don't like their soup, but they always give me extra egg rolls instead of soup with the dinner meals. That is why I gave them 5 stars! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Another yummy meal at Bouchon. I've been to the original in Yountville years ago and to this one as well about 2 years ago. They did it again, although I must say that my previous visit had a bit of an edge on this one. Maybe it was because last time I was part of a party of 10, therefore able to sample a wide variety of foods. Also, last time I had the lovely foie gras terrine which was CREAMY, RICHNESS, CLOG YOUR ARTERIES DELICIOUSNESS! I couldn't order it this time since there were only 2 of us and both of us would have had instant heart attacks if I had! So back to this visit: Started off with a half dozen of my favorite creamy oysters from the Northwest, is there a better way to begin a meal? I had the duck breast which was the perfect ratio of fat to juicy meat and I, unlike some of you yelpers, enjoyed the orange sauce that accompanied it! It is duck a la orange after all...The special peeky-toe crab salad was excellent, even if it was on the miniscule side. And the classic chicken was simply cooked to perfection. Yes, the bread here is near perfection and we ate every last bite of it! Finished with the three bites of brownies with tin dollops of mint, chocolate, and carmel ice cream-the perfect ending. Only complaint here was that the restaurant was not that busy, so it took away from the usual energy of the place. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Their banana pie and carrot cake are SUPER!!!!!!! and if you happen to buy the whole container, you are required to give a 5-dollar deposit which will be returned if you bring it back. Oh Monty, finally! This morning, though I am still a little bit ill, I came only for you :) (and for me:)) Waiting for less than 10 minutes, we were seated by the window. A very nice spot. I decided quickly: I wanted to have a dish of scramble ""something"" (hahaha, I found this funny, I was wondering what ""something"" meant. I asked the server and she said it is for broccoli, pepper, some cheese (and God knows what else!-- too many to list! :D) and has no meat (yay!) Hubby ordered a dish of pesto omelet! Both came with homemade biscuit- I'm in love with this biscuit right away! We enjoyed our brunch soooooooooooo much. I told the waiter: The food is excellent! I wanna come back soon! The food is a five. The service is a five. Yes, full score for you, Monty. Sshhhhh, don't forget to also order their coffee and the donut. The coffee is really an eye opener and the donut is ridiculously huge but so GOOD. Monty has made my Saturday happy! and I really need that after one week of my illness :( Mahalo, Monty! ",0,0,0,0,1

 O Lordee... Was it clean? Was it unclean? uhh... Last minute booking landed us at the Best Western. I'll tell you one thing - it was by far NOT the ""best"". Our 2nd floor room looked clean enough, but we found an old sweatshirt on the floor of the closet and also a camera case/memory card that someone left behind. I know, people forget things at hotels all the time, but when they are still there when new guests arrive, I wonder if housekeeping really ""cleaned"" anything. Wi-Fi is free, but you need to get the user ID and PW by calling the front desk. I was pleasantly surprised that there was a fold out couch in front of the TV. I like watching TV in bed so the bummer was that the TV was in the ""other room"" but on the up side, you could turn it to face where ever you are. The bed sucked: I could feel springs poking me in the back. Same deal with the pull-out couch. Both were really, really old; just sitting on the pull out couch, I sunk down all the way and could feel the metal frame supporting underneath. On top of that, somebody oughta call Sit n' Sleep for Larry to yell at em, cuz this bed had some bed bugs; I woke up itchy with red bite bumps on the back of my calf and thigh. Ugh. Unsatisfactory. Also, the walls are very, very thin; you could hear every step that someone takes upstairs, and the people outside passing by your room. Needless to say, we hardly got any sleep. Staff: The first night, I requested an extra blanket, and the housekeeping staff was courteous on the phone, and security was prompt and friendly to deliver. We checked out a night early and told them about the bed bug issue that drove us to do so. The front desk was... decent - they agreed to refund, as long as Hotels.com agreed. Strangely, it was the ""manager"" of the hotel spoke to us about the issue, but when the Hotels.com representative called, ""the manager was not there"". Funny, cuz we were looking right at him standing around when we saw another lady on the phone speaking to the rep. Whatev, Hotels.com agreed, but the rep was very rude and kept cutting us off. That wasn't Best Western's fault, though... still - Never again. This Best Western should be called Crap Western. ",0,1,0,0,0

 LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Very hip crowd, fits in perfectly with the Plaza Midwood area. Artistry and very laid back. Reminds me of a DC handout I went to. The best sushi in town. Small restaurant and bar, perfect for a outing with a small group of friends. I would not suggest bring kids, this is more of a adults only restaurant. SOUL Rolls are the best. YUM ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place is back to being a normal Pei Wei for those who are concerned. With that said, I'm not really sure what niche Pei Wei occupies. If I want Asian fast food, I'd rather get Panda Express which is simultaneously cheaper, tastier, and healthier. If I'm willing to spend more is rather just go to a normal Asian restaurant. I was never a fan of Pei Wei in Tucson but decided to give this location a shot since I had a coupon for a free meal. I got a cup of the Thai wonton soup, which was fairly tasty but for 1.99 it looked like enough to fill maybe a tea cup. For an entree I tried the spicy Korean with shrimp and white rice. The whole meal was basically a flavorless morass. Two stars for good customer service and fortune cookies but would not go back on my own. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Had their buffet on a Sunday between 11am to 3pm. The Indian food was mediocre and it tasted and looked like it was reheated from yesterday. And what's up with the quantity of chicken? There is a chicken tiki masala with barely any chicken! I had to scrape the tray to find any kinds of chicken. The chicken tandoori was the only thing that made the meal decent. The naan was okay too. The server was really nice and the place looked clean. But seriously the buffet was not worth it. Cook some new food daily and maybe you'll get more clients. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Most times when you go to bars that serve peanuts in shells, there are at least a few nuts that are kinda...retarded. They taste off, look a little strange and are just throwaways. How is it possible that every peanut this bar has is perfect?? Is there a guy in the back inspecting each and every peanut? Aside from the fact that most beers start at $8 here..the food is certainly worth coming for. We had a 1/2 lb of the pastrami and it was pure heaven. I cannot wait to go back and try the rest of the carved meats. It would be a bit pricey to get drunk at this place...perhaps just show up drunk already?? ",0,0,0,1,0

 Hmmm....despite the surroundings the staff at the birdcage didn't get off to the best of starts... A beautiful sunny day with an entire restaurant empty and the only other table besides ours was next to us outside. In spite of having more staff than you could shake a stick at I still had to go inside to firstly get hold of a menu so that we could order. We were quite hungry so thought a couple of snack plates out in the sunshine would be nice. 10 minutes later we'd still not had our drinks order taken. Along comes a waitress...one Passionfruit Margarita and a coke please. No problem. 10 minutes after that someone comes out to say that ""I'm sorry we have no passionfruit would you like a normal Margarita?"" No worries, yes please. 10 minutes after that a lady comes outside with the one drink, the Margarita...erm excuse me we ordered a coke too please. ""Oh sorry, I'll just go and get it for you..."" 5 minutes later it arrived. She didn't even ask if we would like any food. My god not that we would now given the it's taken 35minutes to get a drink in an empty restaurant/bar... The menu however does look nice. Perhaps we will give it a try during one of their 50% off days as if we receive the same level of service I won't feel so enraged with half off the meal. The Jury is out but in the meantime I'm giving this place a 2 and it's only really for the surroundings not the minging Margarita or the poor poor service. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Ok so here it goes. This review needs numbers: 1) We (myself, Blanche and her bf Mark) walked in the door at approx. 8:45 pm. It was pretty busy they had a large table of about 9 people and a few groups of people. There were about 6 empty two person tables. Sitting in the waiting area were two parties, one party of 3, one party of 2. Weird, since there are tables open. No signs saying ""Please Wait to Be Seated"" and no employees coming over to say Welcome or Be Right With You. Servers and people behind the counter seemed to ignore that more people were walking in. 2) Got worried when the party of 2 that was waiting left. Another party of 4 walked in and started to wait. They waited a few minutes then also left! Finally a server walks over, ignores us completely, and goes to the group that was waiting of 3 and calls there name to follow him. Wait... he had there name?! I walk over to counter and ask the guy behind it if I need to put a name down, he says yes! Ok, ""John party of 3"". He has the nerve to go ""about 15 minutes"". I purposely laugh out loud and was very close to saying forget about it, but was dying to see what all the fuss was about these burgers. About 2 minutes later he calls over to me and says ""5 minutes"". 3) So we finally get seated at 9:02 pm. A 17 minute wait with open tables. As we are getting seated a group of about 7 walk in and a server happened to be standing right there and he says it will be a few minutes. They waited about 10-15 minutes and walked out when nobody came back over to them. 4) The guy that Allison J talks about as the server was ours as well. He reminded us of Jimmy Fallon. Kind of neurotic and trying to make up for the stuff that wasn't his fault was funny and annoying at the same time. 5) Left menus with us when we sat and took a bit to come back. (didn't ask if we wanted any drinks when he sat us). By the time he came back we were ready to order drinks and food. Blanche orders Mango Boba Tea ($3.50), the Ronin Burger ($8) and Truffled Parmesean Fries ($3.50). Mark orders just a basic Bachi Burger with no veggies and add egg, bacon and blue cheese ($8.50 w/ additions). I order the Wagyu Steakburger add swiss cheese ($13). Mark orders a Coke and me a water. 6)My water comes out right away but no coke or mango tea. He says Coke is out it will be a minute and tea will be out soon. Comes back in a bit with tea still no Coke. Says Coke is still out did Mark want root beer or anything else. Mark asks for just a water. I watch him go back and grab drinks for another table that came after us and bring those over then do something else, then finally go get Marks water. 7)Skipping a while here and a few times them coming over and promising the food soon. At 9:50 we receive our food! 9:50!!!! We waited 50 minutes from sit down to food. We were very tempted to walk out a few times but we drove from summerlin to try this place and I was not leaving without a burger. 8)Food was good but hard to enjoy because we were so aggravated. Only mistake was Mark's burger had no egg which was what he was looking forward to the most. He let our server know so he would take it off bill but did not want it brought back (for obvious reasons). Everyone seemed to like the food but nobody thought it was anything all that special. My steakburger had a lot of flavor but I thought a tad bit overcooked. I was pretty disappointed that I paid a $1 for cheese and got what didn't even look like a full slice of swiss cheese on my burger. 9)OK- the decor and atmosphere of this place is lousy. It has no ""vibe"" to it at all. You think Asian-American fusion you think this is gonna be a cool place. Not at all, its dull and boring with bright lights and uncomfortable tables and chairs. The walls are plain with a few HDTV's and paintings that are for sale. Problem is the paintings are just random ones and don't go with anything. The music sucked it was just like 70s and 80s rock and added nothing to the atmosphere. Ceilings were too high with nothing there to give it any visuals at all. Felt like a fast food joint. Oh and the placemats sucked! (haha had to add that in for Blanche) They actually were very uncomfortable and kinda hurt when you leaned on them. Which we were doing a lot of with how long we had to wait. Food: 4 out of 5 Atmosphere: 1 out of 5 Service: 1 out of 5 Most likely will not be going back seeing as I'm moving next month. They need a lot of work. I understand they are still somewhat new but that is enough to get them by on a few things but not this disaster. I have worked for a restaurant that was just opening and we did not have those kind of problems ever. My expectations were high with all the 4 and 5 stars on Yelp and I'm sure you all had good experiences I don't doubt that at all. But you probably went at a better time. For the amount of people working and them not being packed. This was just sad. They lost 14 customers in the hour and a half we were there! ",0,1,0,0,0

 So, my husband ventured out last night to pick up dinner for the family. I told him I was craving mexican and so he decided to come home with Cafe Rio. He got one barbacoa burrito, one chicken burrito and a side order of chips (which he put some cheese sauce on). These were the biggest burritos I have ever seen... not sure exactly what he paid for them but they weren't the best I've had. The barbacoa was really sweet like they simmered it in sugar and the chicken was really dry. If it wasn't for the guacamole and the salsa I put on it there was no way I could have eaten it. It was good and maybe we will go back, but we will definetly try something else next time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Seeing as the pub next door had a line of 500 for nickel PBR's, and Beso seated their last table 20 minutes prior, tapas seemed like the most appropriate choice for a 10:30PM dinner. Besides, without any walls, who could resist looking in and admiring the millions of colorful little mosaic pieces that tiled the floors and columns? Absolutely stunning. Service was attentive. The host at the door smiled sincerely. The waiter greeted us with a courteous grin - serious, yet gentle. Sangria was sampled, and the red was chosen. The white offered friendly flavors, sweet for those who cringe at the bitters from reds. However, the red stood bold, while embracing the sweets of the fruits. It was just a beautiful mixture of character and quality. Raspberry Tuna. Amazing. Visually, you acknowledge two cubes of the deep, dark shades of red. One cube has four sides rolled in a mixture of toasted black and white sesame seeds. The other cube, skewered and stacked elegantly on top, had a gentle dash of pixie dust (otherwise known as wasabi powder). Gently lift the skewer, but careful not to let it rip through the cubes... The raspberry cube instantly melts - velvety and smooth - offering tart flavors to the subtle tuna and sesame seeds. Garlic shrimp - another winner. Chorizo and mashed potatoes - perfect for a pre-going out item. I have yet to try the paella - perhaps when I go with a party of 12. My advice: try everything on the menu. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Love, love, love this place!!! Food is fantastic. I usually get the ""Pick Two"" and get a turkey sandwich with all the veggies (cucumbers, sprouts, onions, tomatoes, lettuce) on the 9-grain bread and a garden salad. The salad is fantastic! Spring mix lettuce, carrots, peppers, mushrooms. Not your ordinary side salad! And the honey mustard dressing is fantastic. I have also eaten The East Coast Panini (pastrami, sauerkraut on rye), The Scottsdale (roast beef, red peppers on sourdough) and several other sandwiches. All top notch. Their red potato salad is also fantastic. The service is stellar as well. The counter people are always really friendly and quick. Your food comes fast and I've never had a mistake in my order.

 My personal experience and ongoing situation with this vet is too long for a review on yelp (I already typed it, took a step back and said oh no, too long). To make a long review a little less long..,We took my dog in for dental work due to some mouth pain he seemed to be experiencing and lack of appetite. It was recommended by the vet to do the dental cleaning. My 7:30am appt turned into an overnight visit as the other Dr was sure it was something else, bloodwork and x rays were taken and the teeth cleaning not done (we both thought it best to not do it if there was a more serious, different issue). His health ailments became cancer, kidney failure, and para hyperthyroid disease, with a new ailment arising once yet another test cleared him of the previous one. So now we're back to cancer. But wait, we still don't know what kind or where and we can pay $1200 for an MRI that May give us a better idea of it. THAT is not what set me off to write this review. I understand illnesses are tricky and it's not a simple negative/positive situation. What set me off is that we're 2 weeks into this and the vet is surprised that the Prednisone he gave him hadn't returned him to normal. My dog is still not eating and is yelping a lot when touched on a certain side of his mouth. And now it turns out they didn't even take X rays of that area to begin with. That was the reason for our initial appointment....mouth pain!! How can you completely ignore the area that was the main concern on the initial visit? We're too far in to head to another vet now so we'll have to weather this storm and then steer clear of this vet. 2 other things that don't seen right to me about this vet: 1. They don't call you when test results come in. They tell you a certain time to call them after and then you do and they say they'll call you back in a few minutes when they go look at the results. 2. They don't discuss pricing with you. Any other vet I've been to always gives a price breakdown of estimated costs and if there's anything else that needs to be done, they call you and discuss it with you then. I brought this up to them and the response I got was 'well we waived the overnight fee and the waste disposal fee'. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Not exactly hitting the mark! Needs improvement. If you are making something as simple as a hotdog or brat, it better be Damn Good! OSS...not so much. I'll start with the bun.....It's a bulky chunk of white bread almost resembling being stale. Bland and exactly not what I'm looking for. The Chicago dog: So many things wrong with this item to be calling it that. I'm sorry to the people of Chicago (the home a great hotdogs) that this happened to you. The menu says---- ""Just how Chicagoans like it: tomato, relish, onions, pickle, celery salt, sport peppers, & yellow mustard. Never ketchup!"" I think the cook got a little lazy on mine and I never received relish & sport peppers. When I think Chicago dog, I think Vienna sausage & sport peppers.....What happened here? Blah.... They even used one of their huge white brat buns on this item. Who does that? The $9.50 Sloppy dog: ""A gigantic plate of food!"" is what the menu says....Fooled me I guess. A simple hotdog on a brat bun again, a bowl of subpar chili, onions, and cheddar cheese. Just call it a regular chili dog and charge people the same as your Chicago dog. Overpriced. The Kalberwurst, well maybe the closest thing to tasty I've had. It was a nice veal brat with mushy red cabbage...and that bun....oh yes that bun. Service: I enjoyed being welcomed in and asked if I had questions, but when I have to argue with you about whether I want to eat in or take my food to go all because the Groupon I purchased apparently in small print says ""eat in"".....That is a big NO! I understand that you wanted to take up more of my time to explain to me that your food taste so much better if I eat in, but honestly....Why are you arguing with me at all? I am trying to sample your food and become a long time customer because I work around the corner. Put my food in the ""to go"" container sitting right behind you and send me on my merry way! Atmosphere: Looks great. A handful of nice beer taps, and looks like somewhere ""I would have wanted to go"" have a beer and hotdog after work. Emphasis the WOULD HAVE.... ",0,1,0,0,0

 Being an Italian girl, I am very picky about the Italian food. When I go out to eat, very rarely do I opt for Italian since I can make most of the dishes at home. However, I had a BOGO coupon for this place and decided to check it out. It was a gorgeous night so we had a short wait for the patio area. I like how they have cushioned seats outside where you can get drinks and also eat if you choose to instead of waiting for a table. They had an intriguing selection of wine and I had a smooth, robust pinot noir while waiting for our table. The service could have been better as our waiter wasn't too attentive. He did the job but forgot an item or two that we requested however the artichoke crusted beef medallions redeemed the bad service. They were absolutely perfect---cooked just how I ordered and they melted in my mouth. It was served with mashed potatoes and a hearty portion of fresh veggies and I couldn't have asked for a better meal. Others got the pasta which wasn't drowning in sauce, which is a nice change of pace compared to some Italian restaurants in the area. The chopped salad was wonderful as well-it reminded me of a greek salad. I absolutely love the patio area, selection of wine and was very happy my meal along with the variety of their menu. They had traditional Italian dishes along with more modern Italian dishes so you can go old school or new. ",0,0,0,1,0

 T. Cook's and I have a long history but T. doesn't know it. The first time I met him was over ten years ago when I was just making it in this town. I had reached my goal for my office and in celebration, I took some of my friends and biggest cheerleaders there to celebrate. T's food went right to my g-spot and I had an orgasmic reaction right there at the table. I saved T for special occassions. The next time I went was again for some celebratory occassion with some friends and once again, T's food went right to my g-spot and I had another orgasmic reaction. The third time, I've been spoiled so I was secretly rubbing my legs together under their pristine table linen in anticipation and didn't care who saw me as I licked every delectable morsel off of my plate and fingers, groaning with pleasure. With gloating praise of T., I got a group of friends together for a private dining experience at the Delano Room (min. $500 spending) for a holiday dinner this past Christmas. When making the reservation, the lady was a bit snubby which I can accept when I am anticipating another orgasmic experience. We gather for a evening of fine dining . . . except this time, T. had performance anxiety and failed me. First the waitress looked like she was overworked and coming into the Delano Room was an inconvinence to her because she has just way too many tables outside that were more important to her. When my dish came, it had been under the heat lamp for so long that it was completely shriveled that I could not tell what dish I had ordered. I gave her one look and without a word, she took the dish back and asked me if I would like to order another dish. Where my g-spot was left high and dry was when we got the bill, the antipasto dish that the waitress had recommended we ordered as a 3-person portion was a whopping $45 per plate. She had said that ""some"" additional amount would be added for a larger portion- she neglected to clarify that it would be a whopping 3x's the amount. And we had 2 plates of those . . . $90 for 2 antipasto plates?? So what was supposed to be my most savory experience with T. was completely anticlimatic and totally blemished my memory of him. I know T's popular so he'll have many suitors- just not this one. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is my go to spot when I need caffeine and don't feel like hitting up a Starbucks. There coffee area is always clean and plenty stocked. I am not sure what brand of coffee they supply but whatever it is, is pretty decent. This gas station has actually pretty decent prices to be right off the strip and highway intersection as well. It stays pretty busy with a steady stream of cars and people. But just be mindful to the area. It is expected to see pimps, hookers, drug dealers, drug users, all of it. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This review is specifically about the new show OVO. Almost too late, I remembered that Montreal is home to the world-renowned Cirque du Soleil. Fortunately for me, when I checked the website a few days prior to my trip to Montreal, I saw that the new production OVO was playing during my trip and a few tickets were still available. When I was shown to my seat, I was amazed at how close I was to the stage--just two rows, and maybe 12 feet separated me from some of the world's best acrobats. I was so close that I could see the details of their makeup and costumes, like the seemingly two-inch-long eyelashes on the women. OVO tells the story of a world of insects, including a flirtatious ladybug, a bugtown mayor, and an intriguing stranger who arrives in town carrying a large egg. As a romance develops between the ladybug and the stranger, an equally intense battle over the egg ensues between him and the mayor. As the story unfolded over the course of two hours, I was treated to an amazing spectacle of vibrant costumes, stirring music, and astonishing athleticism and artistry. Group by group, the various acrobats took center stage to perform their magic. The troupe of Asian girls costumed as red fire ants wowed the audience, followed by the women dressed as black widows dancing on a rope web, and the couple who created a beautiful and touching mating dance while twisting through the air on ropes. There were also the shiny bronze scarab beetle men who performed a more traditional flying trapeze, and the lone acrobat who commanded attention for his tightrope act and even managed to balance himself by one hand above the rope. But one of the most visually amazing feats was the interaction of the artists with the climbing wall backdrop. Certainly with the aid of trampolines, the acrobats bounced several feet up the wall and clung to the handholds with the easy tenaciousness of flies on a wall, before bouncing back down again. I can hardly do justice to OVO by describing the performance with just words, so I encourage people to visit the website for a video preview. If you're in Montreal, this is a must-do event. Otherwise, wait until OVO travels to your town on tour. ",0,0,0,0,1

I understand people get busy but iv gone on slow days and the amount of time u wait for your food in quite a bit. Also the prices are a bit high so add a couple of drinks your bill might be quite a number $$$The first time I came here I fell in LOVE with the trail mix salad ..

 Dear Monty's, I miss you so, so much out here in Boston. We've had quite the long-term relationship: from late-night pie after high school dances, to my stint as a busgirl/counter in the ever-important Sunday brunch rush, your old blue tshirts with ""World's Best Coffee"" on the back, to dinner before a show at the Barrymore, to my going back each time I'm in town to run into familiar faces. For years, Tim and Roma and a large posse have made this tiny former gas station a stalwart in the Madison dining scene. Monty's, you and the Barrymore have rejuvenated Atwood Ave. You, and your vegetarian comfort food, zucchini-potato pancakes, scrambled something-or-other, andes mint cheesecake, chocolate malts (don't ask how much ice cream goes into those, btw. but it's all from the Chocolate Shoppe), muffins, pumpkin bars. I could go on and on. And how. For all of you lucky enough to reside around this place, please take advantage. There's nothing like it anywhere else. Sincerely, Angelina ",0,0,0,0,1

 I mention this place and most people don't know where it is BUT it is one of the best kept secrets for great cheese steaks that I know of. GO and find it on S. Priest Dr. just about a block north of Warner and just east off the I-10. My wife is from Philly and she proclaims this joint to be the best of all. Bernadette can talk for 30 min. about Philly cheese steaks like Gino's in Philly and how this place is very close to Gino's as in ""GOOD"". I don't each much beef but I definitely like this place and especially the fried onions and the sweet potato fries. And you can get it in chicken.

 Not for the faint of heart (or wallet)! The food here is very good. Interesting selection of fresh fish, giant prawns and the octopus starter is great. We were given a prime table with a view of the Strip and attentive service. Be warned, however, that the prices are extortionate! Dinner for 4 with a bottle of wine, whole fish ($270) and four giant prawns ($117), two appetizers, two sides and two desserts plus coffee totaled $850. That's approximately double what I'd expected to pay when I made the reservation. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Wow! I'm shocked. No reviews of this place yet? The Walking Company, located in the Fashion Show Mall, was where I needed to stop when we were in Vegas last month. My flip flops just weren't cutting it. My feet and back were killing me from all the walking! The employee who helped us, I think his name was Jamie, was totally cool. Made great suggestions about what would work best for my problems. In the end he recommended a pair of Mephistos. Oh my god! I felt 100 times better walking around in those shoes on the Strip. And they look pretty cute too! Definitely going to go back for my next pair of shoes.

During my last visit this month, the cake tasted totally different. Not terrible, just blah. Nothing that is worth recommending to friends. In fact, now I feel embarrassed that I ever encouraged people to try it. At least the service continues to be very friendly. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Portofino's is the kind of restaurant I can get behind. A small local chain with great food, equally great staff, and a warm and inviting atmosphere. I've ate there twice and both times were good experiences. Their food is hearty and filling and a notch above anything I could concoct in my kitchen. The chicken portofino has everything Italian food should in my opinion, alot of well seasoned tender meat, rich creamy sauce, and a huge helping with enough for leftovers. The shrimp parmigiana isn't quite as perfect, but I still enjoyed it and like that they use really fresh jumbo shrimp. Kudos for their tomato sauce too, some places have a tendency to make theirs overly sweet, but Portofino's keeps their sauce a little tangy, just as a tomato should taste. I feel that great service can make average food subconsciously taste better, but luckily the quality of their food and service shine through in both areas. Their staff is superbly friendly and they come by frequently to check on things. They clearly want you to have a great meal, and as you can probably tell by my review, I like Portofino's quite alot. Skip the 45 minute waits at Olive Garden and come here, you'll leave with a full belly and a smile on your face. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This review is just specific to their lunch menu and lunch service. I took my mom to lunch after a busy morning of shopping at the mall. We were greeted right away and asked which we would prefer, a booth or a table. I love when restaurants give you a choice if either are available. Our server was very sweet, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Mom and I both had salads. The lobster Cob was so yummy! I almost ate it all and it was a good size! The only downside to the meal was that they charged me 3.25 for an unsweetened tea. What??! I should have ordered their house chardonnay for a few bucks more.. Oh well. Everything else was wonderful and I'll certainly return for lunch again soon. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The only plus was the oyster bar which tasted amazing and I will be writing a separate review for. The rooms were definitely cheap looking and the fridge was leaking and unplugged when I got there. Maybe it was defrosting? Hah, not sure. But we didn't end up using it. The shower water temp is flippant I expect due to toilet flushing from other rooms etc. It would go hot to cold to warm and never hot again. Internet wifi not free. There's no elevators. Everything in the courtyard rooms will need to be brought up the stairs. The rooms are some distance from the entrance. Walking through the casino to the rooms, it was passed the bingo hall and looked like we were walking into the mirrors at the end. Very trippy. Being on the north end, it's still far from strip, even to the stratosphere and riviera. I would have paid the extra bucks to stay on the strip since taking the taxi cost just as much. They do offer shuttles to fashion show mall and airport but I never figured out where the drop off/pick up station was since I was told it was off in the corner outside. And Vegas in the winter time doesn't offer you time to kindly round the corners to find the right one. Nahhhhh. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Although they have a very nice special going on - buy a classic pasta and you receive an additional one to take home, the spaghetti with marinara was awful and not worth taking home. It was just this tomato sauce, no garlic, no seasoning. Our waiter, Ryan, was spot on and very attentive. But shortly after our salads arrived, another waitperson brought our pasta. We wanted to have them take it back and keep it warm but she moved plates over and dropped the pasta and left. So, until they start adding some flavor to the sauces, this is not even an average Italian restaurant. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have been here numerous times and don't really have an issue with the inflated prices. I knew going in that I would pay a little more solely based on the fact this SB is located inside of a casino. $3.50 for an iced tea is a little much, but it was good, and the prices are posted. I do have a problem with the customer service, however. On my latest visit the cashier seemed to just be going through the motions and her demeanor was as if I was bothering her. The barista was slow to get my drink ready, but at least he had some personality. The product is good here, as Starbucks usually is, but the customer service is in need of an overhaul, at least during my visits. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This event is pretty chaotic if you're a newbie at this. Even veterans of this were a bit confused. I guess they switched to tickets instead of using cards for the '13 season. Would probably have used a punch card instead cuz keeping track of these tickets was a pain. The option for 5 tickets ($5), was the Sky Vodka area...which you basically saved a dollar per drink, which was $6 dollars compared if you ordered it outside. It was also a younger crowd but only an area blocked off with nothing special inside. The beer choices are horrible (no imports), and were each $6. The food, for the most part disgusting and expensive. Dickey's BBQ was very good though the line was very long do to it being the best and they were very slow and confused. They could have put more pulled pork on the sandwich, you don't get what you paid for but it was good. Dos Gringos and Salty's was just disgusting, served cold. Salty's burrito was already pre made and I had no idea where it came from, must have just been sitting in a bin. The bathroom situation was insane, especially for the women. It would be hard pressed for me to do this again but I'd definitely do the beer garden next time or just wait for Beerfest in Flagstaff which is awesome. You really just need to game plan what your going to do before you get there or atleast once you get there, or you'll spend a crap load of money and can't figure out where and what to do. There's also a place inside which I think was called the Tiki Lounge, with a theater that had really good drinks on special which seemed like the best place to go and if you wanted a break.

 UPDATE even know id still give it a 3.5 upon eating around town a bit more, and coming back to Crisp, I have to say it's on the higher end of 3.5 than the lower end. . Id probably give Crisp a 3.5 if .5's were allowed. Crisp was good not great not bad consistent. Ill go back for sure but it is what it is a salad place. I guess im struggling cause i feel a 3 star is low, but a 4 i think is too high. It is just really what it is an honest salad place. It probably surpassed my expectations. I know i will be back, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh quick bite to eat. It's clean, you get real silverware and real salt and pepper shakers all plusses in my book. It was a little chilly, but what ever thats as much the weather. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I went here tonight for their grand opening and was shocked by how not impressive the food was. I hate to give a negative review as a first review and also hate to give a negative review to a place that allowed me to come to their grand opening, but it just wasn't very good. The food they were serving definitely should have been good, for example, they had a kobe beef slider....sounds good, right? No....it was not good. It was ground kobe, not sure why you would grind such expensive meat, and it was covered in a weird sauce and then topped with velveeta. Yes....velveeta. It was such a waste of a good meat, you couldn't taste the meat at all...it could have been ground anything for all you could tell. Additionally, the BF found a bone in his....not so appetizing. They also had mini burger bites, that were decent, but the way they were served made it so you couldn't taste any of the toppings because they all fell off before it got to your mouth (they were little balls with bacon and whatnot on top skewered with a toothpick, so the bacon and things fell off when the burger was picked up). The crab mac and cheese was mediocre and I believe had velveeta in it as well....how weird. The pork sweet and spicy wings were an odd texture and tasted like frozen food. Not good. The only thing that was decent was the spicy mango cone....a mango pudding of sorts with cayenne in it served in an ice cream cone. We ended up leaving after only a short period of time because we didn't want to continue tasting/wasting their food....that's pretty bad when the food is free. Maybe this place just needs to work out some kinks, but it was surprising that they hadn't done so before this event. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I had read all the Yelp reviews and purchased a Groupon for an oil change from Central Car Care. I am very disappointed. The actual experience was great during the service. One of the workers made coffee for me and the lounge area was nice for a car shop. I was advised that my truck needed a water pump, belts, and an alignment which I got done elsewhere due to a better cost. I think they were upset that I turned down the additional service because a week after the oil change I found out that none of my fluids had been topped off, that my battery and alternator were almost dead (no one bothered to check the battery at all during a 16-point inspection), and that my oil change gauge had not been reset. I would not go back to this shop. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was a fan of the old Teakwoods which was housed in what is now Tavern Grille. I tried out Tavern Grille and loved it. The food was great, they added desserts and on some days the owners oversaw the goings on which contributed to good and quick service. So I am a fan. Today I went to Tavern Grille with a friend and we had burgers and sliders. When the burger came I saw that it came with a one piece of thin slice of pickle maybe 1/8 inch thick and 3 inches long( Crossectioned). I noted that my sliders did not have any pickle. I can' t possibly think of eating hamburger or slider for that matter without a pickle. So at my earliest possible opportunity I called the waitress over and asked for a FEW slices of pickle. Pickles?, she asked. Yes Pickles, I responded. A few minutes later she returned with one slice of pickle on a plate. I couldn't believe my eyes. A patron makes a special request for pickleS and you provide one pickle on a plate? Amazing. If they couldn't give more than one pickle perhaps the waitress should have told me that more pickles would have required an upcharge. I would have paid it. So I didn't finish my sliders, paid my check, walked over to Fry's Marketplace and bought a jar of pickles. I will eat the rest of my sliders with my newly bought jar of pickles. Pickles and day old sliders. Better than freshly made sliders without pickles. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Island Style Restaurant #2 is located in the food court of the Greenland Supermarket and they hail from the original Island Style restaurant on West Sahara. The Mom and I headed to Greenland for lunch and did a tour to check out each place to see what interested us. They shouted their wares and specials, hoping to hook us in. Island Style was our last stop, and for some reason, the Mom was more interested in what they had to offer. She was eyeing the Bibimbap for $7.95, and I mentioned that the Husband likes that dish too, but with the stone pot version. We inquired and found out their Dolsat Bibimbap was $8.95. (She wasn't very familiar with the dish.) As I pondered what to get, an order of fried dumplings were placed in front of us for another customer. The Mom was immediately impressed by it and the smart guy at the counter pointed out that you get the dumplings for free if your order was $20 or more. Of course, that easily sold us and we added the Kalbi Plate ($12.95) to our lunch to get that order of dumplings! We took a seat nearby and waited for our order. The order of 10 dumplings were ready first, and they do usually go for $5.95. It was piping hot and we loved the extra crispy texture. It was filled with pork and noodles. Two banchan were given to us as well - kim chee daikon and kim chee cabbage. The Dolsot Bibimbap came with a side of soup, and it was definitely a generous portion. We ate as much as we could and packed the leftovers. The Kalbi Plate came with mac salad and rice, and I enjoyed the tasty beef - lots of flavor indeed. We also had leftovers of this dish too. The Husband ended up getting all the leftovers for lunch today and he was a bit skeptical about the bibimbap (sans the hot pot). However, upon arriving home this evening, he proclaimed that the bibimbap was very good and the kalbi tasted really good for leftovers. Overall, sounds like everyone was happy with Island Style - and they make for good leftovers too!

 I agree with David V.'s Tip, this is strictly a Japanese Curry house (not Katsu house) and they do it right!! I've been a handful of times and the curry is always consistent and has great flavor. In addition, I like/enjoy: -You basically build y our own curry plate. You can either start with a plain plate and add on items, or just order one of their set plates. -You can change the spicy level, but you pay for anything above spice level 5 -They have Curry Udon now!!! -Chicken Katsu is a thick cut, not dry and fried well. -Jasmine Tea is good -Spinach Curry is a good way to get the greens in without taking away from the curry.

 I came here with my husband about an hour before closing time. I don't usually like going to restaurants last minute but I have been craving Indian food for awhile. I really wanted to try a lamb dish even though I've never been a big fan of it in the past . I've always thought the taste of lamb had a weird after taste. I tried the Lamb Vindoolo ($12.99) which is cooked with potatoes and Chilly sauce. The lamb was tender and surprisingly no weird after taste. It was really good ! I also had a Mango Lassi that was super delicious. I'm glad it came in a clean glass because at Bollywood they gave me a glass with a whole bunch of fingerprints all over it. That was a turn off! My husband had a salad with garlic naan .The salad tasted great with the naan but too sour without it. The naan came out hot and had a nice garlicky taste to it. We didn't feel rushed even though we came in an hour before closing time. The service is attentive, quick, and friendly. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've written before about how I prefer Wal-Mart over Target. I can't believe how often this is true. The other day we were in there and had to return something, and it took what seemed like forever to accomplish this simple task. Now don't get me wrong - the Wal-Mart return process can take a while. And now you have to get the little bar code as you go through the main entrance. The line can be long. But they often have two or even three workers at the desk (depending on the location). At this store - one of the larger ones in the area - there were at least five people in line, and there was one person working the desk. She was very nice, but the line moved s-l-o-w. Eventually we made it up to the front of the line, and returned our merchandise and moved on. But it was a whole lot more difficult than at Wal-Mart, underscoring the reason why I shop there instead (usually). ",0,1,0,0,0

 ""Who will tell them? You need me to tell them how you helped at the hotel. They blame you for all their misfortunes. "" -- Hotel Rwanda (2004) I am a Marriott snob - I prefer to stay in Marriotts wherever I go. I love the points, I love the service, I love the status. This time, we stayed here because of the ease and convenience to where our meetings would be and unfortunately that was a mistake. The front desk staff was the nicest thing about this location. Don't get me wrong, the room was clean and well made, but lots of little things add up very quickly. First, I was right by the lobby - so sound was a MAJOR issue. Any conversations had in the lobby - I could hear (and quite well). The walls were thin as I could hear conversations in the next room as well (not just their TV). The breakfast was fine - included in the cost of the room - but the toaster did not work very well at all (so you ended up with hot bread instead of toasted) and the juices were like water with flavoring. Also the scrambled eggs were like rubber and from powder or egg beaters or something - very watery. The coffee - also not very good. Thank goodness there was a Starbucks across the street. The A/C units were the old-style and made insane noises when cutting on and off all night - not very helpful when trying to sleep. Time to upgrade, Marriott. My co-worker and I agree that we won't be staying here again. Probably the Courtyard across the street or something nicer a little further from the customer next time around. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Came here for Christmas dinner finally after numerous trips to vegas and saying ""I want to go there!!"" Well I finally went and it was great food. We ordered the cheese plate for appetizer and it was to die for, especially with the fresh baked baguette that they kept brining to my table after we fell in love with it. We ordered the 22 oz bone in steak to share with garlic spinach and whipped cauliflower. OMG!!! it was better than mashed potatoes and was just the best fluffy, creamy goodness that I have ever tasted. The steak was cooked to perfection and the ambience was the best as well. I am a sucker for parisian ambience and this place is the place for it. I must say I was a little ticked off by the staff that help the waiters at the table... they were not the nicest people and just plopped and slided the plates on the table when they arrived, until I had to say something and they they all got nice....... interesting. Needless to say our waitress was fantastic and answered all our questions about the menu and made sure to check on us without being too overbearing. Apparently the hot ticket dinner item was the beef bourginione which I will have to order next time I am in vegas..... love that beef!!! ",0,0,0,1,0

 We had an enjoyable dinner tonight. It was really busy but I was able to make a 7:45 pm reservation via Opentable 40 minutes before the reservation. What made the dinner so enjoyable was the friendliness of the staff, starting with the hostess and ending with our stellar waitress, Tracy. She checked up on us often without being intrusive. Our water glasses were filled constantly. The dishes we ordered included: -Two bowls of French Onion Soup- very filling with the right amount of melted cheese and bread. It was on the sweeter side but good. -Trout Amandine: The trout was tasty but just slightly over cooked. The green beans were crispy and well seasoned. -Mussels Mariniere, full order with frites. The creamy white sauce was delicious as a dip for bread. The mussels were good but a bit too small. However, the portion was big. The frites were thin fries that were slightly too crispy for me. -Bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream- it typically is one of my favorite desserts. However, the bread was slightly too dense. We liked the fresh French bread in a bag. The restaurant is easy to get to- it is across the street from the Bellagio Fountains. The dining room was dimly lit- I would have preferred a brighter dining area. Overall, we really liked our friendly and attentive server. The food was good so I would give it 3.5 stars. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My partner brought me here for my birthday last year and I brought him here for his birthday this year. It is a bit far from us, so we make a special occasion out of it. This is really unique place with very unique food. I love the Curry Waffles and Supreme Nachos! My partner ate the this Red Beet Burger that was very special. It was really red and yummy. I have to ask them to VEGANIZE them because they have like 2 dishes with eggs, but they are always accommodating. The place is super cute with home-made desserts that are always vegan. Across the street is the parking lot with the most awesome graffiti that I always like to take pictures of. I love the area. We walked around the streets before and after dinner. There are little fruit and veggie plants that are being planted all the time in the front yards of the restaurant. I heard the owner walks and waters them every day. That is AWESOME. If you drive a little bit, you will see a green bike lane! They really put a lot of effort to making the space very nice... The price is fair and reasonable. I do hope they expand their menu though. It is a bit small, but I do love their breakfast choices. It is awesome to see Vegan varieties like that. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place was fantastic! I feel like we ordered one of everything off of the menu because we wanted to try a bunch of stuff. We had garlic bread, dinner salad, zuchini sticks, ribs and fries, mushroom thin crust pizza and a pepperoni deep dish pizza. The pizzas were wonderful and the zuchini sticks were good too. The best thing in my opinion, which we actually ordered for the kids, were the ribs. I've never had better ribs anywhere! Who woulda guessed? I like the salad and the garlic bread, but if I were to go back, I would have ribs and fries with an appetizer of zuchini sticks. Great service, not too long of a wait (we have three kids and a long wait would not be fun). It was super busy and we were seated in about 10 minutes. Deep dish pizzas take about 40 min, but the time flew by. They recommended we call ahead to order it in advance next time. Super impressed!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 True Food has so much going for it - a well thought out menu, delicious flavor combinations, a killer kids' menu, and good service. We've been many, many times, and have always enjoyed ourselves. The Husband and I particularly like the menu coding system (vegetarian? gluten-free? you know EXACTLY what you can/can't order). The mock-tails are deliciously refreshing... light, bright flavors that just taste good for you! The Husband swears by the crudite appetizer... and even I, who doesn't always love the green things, really enjoyed it. The curry dish is my personal fave, and the carne asada tacos are pretty darn good, too. The kids' gluten-free pasta with red sauce, greens (kale??), and lots of cheese is enormous and totally worth the money. A good stand-by place, especially when we're feeling like eatin' some healthy stuff :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 There are Hawaiian restaurants everywhere in Las Vegas, but this is one of the more ""ono"" spots in my opinion! * Chicken Katsu - Can never go wrong with deep friend strips of chicken and rice, right? * Adobo Omelet - Scrambled egg wrap around rice mixed with shredded pork adobo. It's in the shape of a burrito and is pretty huge (although I can easily gulf down one myself!). I know a lot of people hype this dish up, but to me, it lives up to the hype. It tastes like home cookin! * Loco Moco - Gotta love hamburger meat smothered in gravy with egg all over? I've tried many a loco moco and Aloha Kitchen has one of the best I've tried in Vegas (best I'd ever had is in Hawaii). * Oxtail Soup - Delicious and a must try if you can. * Saimin - A little too salty for me. * Tapsilog - Tapa, egg, and garlic fried rice just like my dad's standard breakfast. Prices are reasonable and the d \ u00e9cor is cute (there's a location on Sunset that is aesthetically nicer) . My one complaint is that the food can take long sometimes and the service is par. There were a couple of times we got the wrong order/order never called when eating there and a couple of times we got a cashier who just seemed angry all the time. This could have been due to the busyness of the place though since it does get pretty crowded late nights. We frequent the bar next door too. They have a pretty great song selection, although it can be hard to get on the mic on busy Friday and Saturday nights. Drinks are normal priced, but the karaoke is free. Have some drinks there then walk over next door immediately after for a complete night out! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I don't understand why people love this place. I think its seriously overrated. At least for food. Sure, the atmosphere for games/UFC is awesome and they do have an extensive bar. But just to dine I'd say is pretty mediocre. The wings are small, but I will say the sauces are pretty good. I had the Chili Garlic, Garlic Parm and the Wild. All we're actually good. Everything else was just ok. All of the appetizers seem like they just take them out of the frozen food bag and drop them into the fryer. Nothing stood out, it tastes like fast food. Service is good. But next time I'll just goto PT's or Village Pub. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The two reviews are about the wrong Doctor or are down right false. We have had two babies with Dr. Leonard. It was discovered that our first daugher, Charlie, had a Cystic Hygroma at 14 weeks. We had a fun ultrasound at a commercial location when her condition was found. As a side note, we went back to that tech later to thank her and she said Dr. Leonard treated her with great respect. I can't imagine it is easy for a commercial tech to call an office and give bad news and be berated by a Doc when they are just trying to help. Christine, the tech, said that is normally the case, but Dr. Leonard was grateful and thanked her .... We were called into the office the next business day. We knew something had to be up. Dr. Leonard was loving, gracious, and let us know he would be with us at each step, and he was. Mary, Dr. Leonard does not per scribe the pill let alone have ""abortion pills."" I don't know what pill you are referring to and I can only imagine it's plan B. Further, having HIGH hCG numbers would indicate the opposite of a miscarriage. In a miscarriage it would be expected to have very low numbers. I am sorry you had a bad experience at the hands of another OB, but I think you are confused on the details. K.G. Dr. Leonard has a form on his website where people can ask questions and he personally responds to each query. As far as bedside manner, when we had our second daughter, Amelia, he was in our room with plenty of time. He sat and prayed with us as Sarah came close to delivery. During delivery, Amelia's heart rate was dropping because the chord was pinched by her head. Dr. Leonard worked expertly, and very quickly to deliver our healthy little girl. Afterwards, he ensured all three of us were in a good place before he left. He is nothing like the stories you hear where the Doc is in at the last second, pulls the baby out, and is gone before you know it. When our first daughter passed at only 23 weeks due to Cystic Hygroma, turned Hydrops, he took the time to attend her funeral. He treats your child like the living, breathing person it is. We looked forward to seeing him and his team every week with Charlie. They made us feel loved, and cared for. We felt better because we knew we didn't carry this burden alone. The entire office shared the load. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I don't usually review Strip Hotels but I'll make an exception this time. Mr. Wynn knows how to do things right. First came the Wynn Las Vegas then Encore. These two properties are the top cream of the crop. Beautifully designed with all the amenities and satisfying service you could only expect from anything Steve Wynn builds. Everything is just better at the Wynn/Encore. The pools, Nightclubs, the gambling action, cool vibe and crowd is as good as it will get for us sinners. I'm taking the liberty to mention that you will have the best Vegas sex in here! Yes you heard that right, someone had to say it. Guys, you know what I'm talking about. Oh by morning, you'll wake up refresh, ready to do Vegas again or hungover and sleeping most of the day haha but don't worry, you're crashing in one of the nicest beds in the world!

 The Duce was the last stop for my last night of 39 and got their before the midnight hour forced me into the Fab & 40 club. I have never been to The Duce and had been looking forward to going. As soon as I walked into The Duce, I was awe struck, I absolutely love this place! At the last stop my friends and I were at, I left a lil tipsy and was in need of some food, so when we 1st got to the Duce, 1st item of business that needed taken care of was order some food, after surveying the menu and debating on if I wanted something sweet or not, I went with the cheeseburger sliders. Let me tell you, these were the best cheeseburger sliders I have had in a very very long time, the bread was soft, tender yet held the sliders together well, the cheese was perfectly melted over the burger, oh it was just delish! The Duce has plenty to offer everyone, corn hole, foosball, Ping-Pong, hula hooping, dancing, singing, drinking or just chilling, The Duce has space for it all! Only down side I have is that it's hot, but that's the Phoenix summer weather, I am sure when it's no longer summer ticket, The Duce would be rocking! I am looking forward to coming back and playing some games for sure! ",0,0,0,1,0

 In the spirit of getting back to my original burger 'to-do' list from way back, I finally ventured over to Rambo's Kitchen last week to see what they have to offer. It was on a Vegas top 10 burger list I read a while back but was located in a part of town I rarely went through, but that's not an excuse any more. What has been an excuse for some time though, are the very polarizing comments and responses on their Yelp page. It seems that they've had some issues with customer service from time to time, and instead of just apologizing, their representative on the site tends to be a bit too defensive in his responses. This all made me a little hesitant, but finally decided to evaluate for myself. How did it go? Rambo's is located in your typical Vegas neighborhood strip mall, but the interior is pretty unique. Much like the Metro Pizza on Decatur and Flamingo reminds me of the 80's Saved by the Bell diner, this place is fully decked out in 60's theme with posters, surf boards, books about the 60's, tie dye, etc. There's even a TV with all sorts of 60's-era commercials playing on it, and music playing throughout the restaurant from that period. I brought this place up to my girlfriend a couple months ago, but after looking at their menu she nixed the idea as we're trying to eat healthier and there isn't much on that front to choose from, although there is quite a bit. They offer a few burger choices; the one I initially went in for is the self-titled Rambo Burger: 1/2 lb burger stuffed with a special combo of cheeses and topped with a stack of pulled pork, bbq sauce, topped with an onion ring on a toasted bun, but after contemplating it I just didn't have the appetite for such a thing on this visit. Instead I went with the waitress' other recommendation, the cheesy cheese burger: 1/2 lb burger stuffed & topped with a combo of cheeses and topped with bacon, lettuce and tomato. What was brought to me was a bit less that groovy. Sorry, had to. The meat didn't have much flavor, the cheese that was supposedly stuffed in there wasn't noticeable, but there were lots of what I think to be fat chunks. It was also very dry by the end, and I ate pretty quickly. The bun was a bit too big for the meat, but good, buttery, fresh and sweet. There was way too much lettuce and I had to pull some off. The cheese was melted and good, but I don't know about 'cheesy cheese', just kind of a regular cheeseburger. The bacon flavorful, but some of it was not cooked enough and it was a bit chewy. Yes I chickened out on ordering their signature burger, but if this is a sign of how that might be, I question why this was on a top 10 list I read in the past. The fries on the other hand were very fresh and great at first, but got a little oily near the end. Still they were decent, of the natural cut variety. My pickle slice was a bit small, but hardly a deal breaker. The additional side option seemed a little excessive, I went with a pasta salad as it seemed like a good idea, but just ended up being a bit too much food. The piece of bazooka gum with my bill was a nice touch though. The final price of $14.46 is about normal for a local spot with a 'fancier' burger, but I can't say I'd spend that again. I'm sure Rambo's offers plenty of tasty options for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but based on my meal I can't really stand by the burger. ",0,1,0,0,0

 First time here and went in for a staight manicure ($15). The front desk and ambience are great. Tammy, who took care of me, was not friendly nor a good listener. She asked if I wanted square tip, I said round. She filed my first hand square. I asked if she could please file them round, so she had to cut my nails even shorter. When it came to painting my nails, she left me under the ultraviolet light to do someone else's pedicure. A little unsure, I sat there too long until the gal next to me asked, ""how long did she tell you to sit here?"" Her nail gal said I should be done. After leaving and look at my nails in the sunlight, I have all kinds of streaks and polish on my hands.

 Well we returned again today only to experience the exact same thing. We sat outside at the bar during breakfast as the wait was 20 mins, the hostesses suggested the outside bar area. It took approx 20 mins to get iced coffee. The people across from us sat down after us and was enjoying their blood marys long before our coffee arrived. My husbands order was incorrect. The girl next to us also received the incorrect order. My scrambles eggs were not very good. My breakfast potatoes were undercooked. Also, i asked for strawberry jam and didnt realize until i put it on my biscuit that they have me raspberry. $30 later, I'm still hungry and headed home.

 Tried this place a couple months back. Was looking for some quality Thai food, and came across this spot on Yelp. I went around 530 or 6 on a Thursday, and the place was empty. Open seating at any hour is never good in my opinion but I wasn't concerned with the amount of people that frequented the place. I was worried about authenticity! I ordered the Pad See Ew, and it was delicious. The portion was large and I think it ran about 10$. Since I checked in on yelp, I received a free Thai iced tea.

 With the same company that owns local, steel cactus, diesel etc I should have known the service was going to be terrible. Our waiter appeared to be on drugs. Zero knowledge of any happy hour specials that resulted in us to grab a bar tender for information. There was 8 of us, so as a ""larger party"" I can understand some difficulty in regards to splitting checks. However, he decided to assign us all a seat number by counting out loud and pointing---I was ready for a game of duck duck goose to follow. The incoherency continued well into the evening. Overall the food was decent. Overpriced for appetizers but the decor and atmosphere was a plus. Bathrooms were clean which is always good in my book.

 After living in Vegas for a short time, I've made it. No, I didn't become the headliner for a show on the strip. I made it to a baseball game. I attended the 51s game for a Yelp CMYE outing, and I couldn't be happier with the experience. I didn't know any of the players, or anything about the teams. I just wanted to come out and hang out with my yelp friends, and have a good time. Having said all that, I do watch baseball, but just not at the AAA level. The game atmosphere is nice. Concessions are cheapish. Bathrooms are clean, and I had one hell of a time with my friends. My advice to you? Try to pay attention to the ball as it is being batted.

 Thai Basil is one of the better restaurants that litter Clerk Street. Situated just opposite the Festival Theatre, it targets this crowd, with the pre-theatre menu always seeming very popular whenever I've been in there. Also due to the fact that they are used to dealing with high numbers of people in a short space of time, the service is excellent. The staff are polite, efficient and really speedy, exactly what you want. Don't be put off by the looks, although it appears tiny, there is a great atmosphere inside and the food is great. The full menu has a huge variety of Thai dishes, with good curries and stir fries. If however, you are on a budget, the lunch or pre theatre menu offer excellent food for a reduced price, two courses for \ u00a36 and \ u00a312 respectively, and three courses for only a pound more. The pad thai is great, as is the hot and sour chicken soup. Thai food is normally expensive in Edinburgh so it is nice to find a place that doesn't break the bank. With good service and great food at affordable prices, Thai Basil is a good find. Whilst not the best quality dishes around it is certainly a pleasant experience and I would definitely recommend it for a cheaper alternative ",0,0,0,1,0

 The service was fine, we had a nice waitress that kept our drinks full. For the price I thought it was a pretty small bowl, and it just seems like a game they are playing. You get this small silver cat dish and when they serve it ,it comes in a large red funky shaped bowl. As if no one can figure that out. The fried rice looked ok, the noodles were disgusting. I should have refused to eat them as they made my stomach upset later in the day. Very, very greasy, sauces were sugery. They have calories on the wall and I have a sneaking suspicion they are very misleading and the calorie count is probably without the carbs and sauces.... This place is run in a guise of hoping we don't notice we are being treated like knuckleheads sardined in for an 8.99 bowl of goo. The cat dish is what? to prompt you to what upgrade to a second bowl of goo? Yes, the tables were small, there was 4 people in my party and I was afraid to move my elbow. The bill was 45 bucks without tips. ( you get reminded to tip too via signs)... For that amount of money you are better off going to the Great Greek On Warm Springs and you can eat off their family meal for a few days. By the way two people in the party were hungry later on in the day.. so after spending so much on lunch they weren't even full... seemed extra expensive on that note.... I was disappointed with the overall experience. It wasn't a total bust but I would not go back unless someone else wanted me to go. In short too much work and aggravation. Getting your own food, squeezing in and out of the tables, and too little of it for the price once you consider tax and tip. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm a total downtown hipster-hater, so of course I eyed this place with huge trepidation for a month or so after it opened. It LOOKED like an overpriced, annoyingly pretentious place...but I'm trying not to be so judgy, so I finally went in to see what was up. Honestly, I feel like there's no excuse to charge these prices for Mexican food. I mean, wtf. It's guacamole and corn chips and tequila, for pete's sake! It wasn't reCOCKulously expensive -- not as bad as I'd feared -- but was still pricey for what it was. Food-wise, everything was ok. The free chips & salsa are fine, nothing out of the ordinary, but they did replenish our basket without even asking, so I give them points for that. I ordered the cheapest margarita on the list, which at $9 was OK... not bad by Strip standards, but this isn't the Strip!! Then I had the street corn appetizer, which was good, but...any better than real street corn at Valley View & Sahara for a fraction of the price? Then the snapper tacos, which were ok, but again...two smallish tacos for $12 or whatever it was? Really? Ambiance-wise, the place was not NEARLY as annoying as I'd expected. It was actually kinda low-key, and I give them points for having plentiful outdoor seating. Overall, the place was OK, but... too expensive for me to consider going back there. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was a little disappointed with Hash House a Go Go. The portions - yes, they are huge. But the food was just okay. I had the chicken and waffles and really, neither were spectacular. I guess the novelty is being able to get them (and a huge brunch menu) throughout the day. My friend had the pork sandwich, which was unexpectedly fried. Everything was warm and delivered quickly, but nothing seemed fantastic. It felt like the appeal is huge portions and fatty carbs (and I do love carbs), but the draw of large portions takes precedence over quality. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I don't often review McD, but after my experience with their drive-thru, I needed to say something. I went here during afternoon rush hour on the way home from work. Not only did I get a regular Dr. Pepper instead of the Diet Coke I ordered, but I realized why the drive thru was going so slow: The exit line spills out onto southbound 7th Street as it crosses Van Buren. During rush hour, this is a disaster. So much traffic comes down 7th Street that you could find yourself waiting to exit the lot for five minutes or more--per car. It might not take that much time for you, but it's the luck of the draw. This is a more or less typical McD, situated in a lousy spot traffic-wise. I'm not lovin' it. Even if you get what you order, you'll have to wait forever to get it. Nothing's fast about the food around 4:30 or 5:00pm if you're hoping to eat on the road. Better to park, eat inside, and wait for the torrent of cars to die down a bit before heading home. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Met with my wife and her co-workers here for drinks several times. My wife likes the fancy mixed drinks and sassy service. I don't care about those very much. The best thing about this place (and the Double Down, same owner) is that you will NOT hear Don't Stop Believing or the cha cha slide or modern country music, ect......this bar has a juke box loaded with surf and lounge music. Even if that's not your thing it's a nice change! I like that it's dark inside too. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place is really cute. We waited 30 minutes for our reserved table. The menu was not the same menu I had looked at on-line (I went back and saw that the spring menu is still on-line, although it is now September), so I was a little disappointed in that as I had chosen the restaurant based on the menu. Nothing on the current menu appealed to me that much. I got the duck with faro. It was very salty. It was just so-so, nothing memorable. My husband got the steak and fries, which was somewhat tough and also very salty. They were out of the dessert we wanted. It was our anniversary, which I told them when we made the reservation. The only thing they did for that was that we got a ""happy anniversary"" from the hostess as we left. We went a few blocks away to another french restaurant and had dessert and coffee there on the patio. They brought a sparkler out with dessert in honor of the celebration, which was a nice touch.

 I had a great experience at Marble Express. I only needed 2 slabs and a little but of tile for my condo and my sales person, Leor, moved all the slabs for me with the fork lift so I could see all the slabs from the bundle and pick my favorites. He also gave a recommendation for a fabricator that turned out to be great. I came in three times and couldn't make up my mind. Leor was very patient and gave me some samples to take home and see how they looked in my house. In the end I decided on a Mascrorato granite for my counter tops. It is BEAUTIFUL! I took a few trips to other places in town and they were fine but no one had the selections that I found at Marble Express. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We just made our first visit to this year old spot in Middleton, after a great recommendation from friends, and while mourning the loss of Casa Bianca, Madison's closest approximation of NY-style pizza. Madison is not a great pizza town --local Wisconsin cheese lacks the tang of Boston's Regina's or the great New Haven apizza spots, and the corporate Uno's lacks the distinctive pizazz of the Chicago original (we prefer Due's) and its best Chicago competitors (e.g., Lou Malnati's). Given all that, Villa Dolce was a very pleasant surprise. Crusts were excellent, and the imaginative toppings (we are veggie types on our pizza choices) were exceptionally fresh and tasty. In our view, Villa Dolce is a strong competitor for best (upscale) pizza in Madison. We'll make a few more visits before coming to a final decision on that... The gelato we sampled was superb--intense, delicious and distinctive taste and excellent consistency. I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. We strongly disagree with another reviewer's comment on service. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic without being overly intrusive. Her recommendations were on the mark, and she suggested favorites we might try on future visits. The seating and environment were comfortable and very pleasant, with seasonal outdoor seating as well. More cafe -like than other pizza places in town. All in all, a winner. We'll reserve a fifth star pending additional visits. ",0,0,0,1,0

Bacon mashed was creamy the way I liked it and Cheese scrambled eggs! The Service. Wait time to be seated 15mins. Server was great if we were curious anout an item id it was ordered in his area he'd run by with a quick flash.

 I went to Mathers West End tonight to watch the US game. We scored in the first minute and the four of us Americans who showed up cheered happily. Unfortunately, the bar regulars did not take kindly to that and made their displeasure known, repeatedly, throughout the rest of the first half (we quickly left at half-time). I am a recent expat to Edinburgh, but I have never felt more out of place, nor have I ever had to deal with ANYONE being hostile toward Americans. People in this great city are usually so welcoming to the yanks. Unfortunately the surly barmaids did nothing but comfort the poor natives who had to watch 4 Americans enjoy their team's goal in the World Cup. Please take down the American flag and don't tell anyone else to come to this bar for USA games, I don't want visitors to think this bar represents this wonderful city. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Tuesday, a visiting family member decided to take eight of us to dinner and one of the girls selected Pita Jungle. I am now sad to say that I had never been. Both the food and the experience were excellent. I had the Chicken del Sol (a Southwest style chicken cooked with diced tomatoes, garlic, black beans, and sweet corn), which comes with a chipotle cheddar pita crisp. The chicken itself was better than most, but what really made the meal was the chipotle cheddar pita. It complimented the dish perfectly. Perhaps most surprising were the portion sizes, given the relatively low cost. I did not expect to have so much food. Serving eight people is difficult for anyone, but the waitress handled our party's size decently well. The only mistake we had was an incorrectly-prepared dish, which the staff replaced without a fuss. It is the only thing keeping my review from being five stars. We've already made plans to go back...

 For a Marriott, this place sure did disappoint. We've stayed at many other Marriott's and their affiliates in the greater Phoenix area, and this one was by far the saddest we have stayed at. Beside being built into a mountain, that's about all there is to ""ooh and ahh"" about. Terrible experience from the moment we pulled up to register. While the staff was welcoming, they offered no extra information or anything about their hotel. After driving around the hotel to come to our room, not even being offered valet service for our car, we dragged our suitcases up the elevator and through a most aggravating hallway, where we arrived to the saddest part of all, the room. The room looked run down and cheap. It's 107 degrees in Arizona currently in June, and when we got in the door the air was off. I'm sorry, but if you know a specific room will be accommodating guests, wouldn't you have the air on? At least on a low setting? The sliding bathroom door wouldn't close, the illuminated magnifying mirror didn't illuminate and a whole host of other things. Most of all, the thing that disappointed us most was that we paid for a room with a patio and a view, and we got a patio that faces a gate that was on a landing that takes you to the pool. And the view... the landing pool for the slide. Wow! NOT. We called down to the front desk to see if they have wifi in the room, and the lady I spoke to hadn't the slightest clue. We knew we had paid for a room with internet included, otherwise it's $14.95 a night. She insisted the only way to connect was with the Ethernet cord, and no other way. She was clueless. So after a couple minutes of confused banter, she transferred me to Internet services, which answered the question in about 2 seconds. Needless to say, yes, they do have wifi. Sadly, after reaching out to the Marriott customer service line and management about our disappointment, the only thing they could offer us was to fix the problems in our room and a complimentary breakfast buffet. Whatever. For literally $1 more a night we could've stayed at one of the JW Marriott resorts that have always been amazing, and I wish we world have. Seriously, 2 stars only for the beautiful mountain and nothing else. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place has a lot of rules: 1. You cannot wait inside if there are no seats available, even though when you go inside there is plenty of standing space near the ATM. There is not standing at the bar, or around the tables. 2. If you have a party more than 4, and you want to split a check per what you ordered, this will not be accommodated. You will have to split it evenly. This got very awkward for my group of friends because we all ordered very different things. Luckily some of our party had cash so the four of us that didn't could pay for what we bought. 3. They do not take reservations between 4 and 8pm 4. There is a $10 minimum for a card charge, but luckily the drinks are $9-11 dollars, so you should be ok. I've been here twice. Once was on a Thursday around 7pm. We were told we couldn't have a reservation till after 8. When I arrived at 7, the place was empty and luckily they sat us. The second time was last Saturday (labor day weekend) and we were told it was a 2 hour wait for a cocktail... not dinner... so we went to another bar in cityscape. So the first time I was able to actually get in was ok. The drink menu is fun. Tons of options and there was a fantastic graph on the back to help guide you if you wanted something exciting, sweet, traditional, or savory. My cocktails were great, no complaints. I was really excited to have a fun, new, cocktail place in phoenix so things were looking up. The food menu has some left to be desired, but if you treat this as a place to get a drink vs. getting dinner, then you'll be fine. The food was good though, just not a great variety. 1. I had the patte with bread, very yummy. 2. The Ramen Burger... well that was disappointing. Yes, it says that there is a lot of sauce on it (""extra napkins""), but it really did over power the burger. I could barely taste the beef or the ramen... really they acted like conduits for the sauce which wasn't that memorable. 3. My plain fries, a side that is separate, were really good. I would like to have a cocktail and these fries every time I come here. 3. The loaded friends looked really good and my friends enjoyed them We all liked being there, and I wanted to go back and introduce other friends to bitter and twisted (hence last Saturday) but they just make it too hard. Also considering there is the blue hound, arrogant butcher and squid ink in walking distance (all have great cocktails and food). I will try to come back again, I just hope they accommodate customers a little better. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We almost bailed on this place because of the NY reviewers below but realized they had posted on like every possible reviewing site, and were soooo ""angry"" that we decided they had some personal vendetta towards the restaurant to go through the process of posting the same complaint to sooo many sites. Thinking of how many people eat there every evening and theirs being the worst review led us to roll the dice. We had heard about this from the Andrew Zimmern Montreal episode but when I tried making reservations over a month out it kept giving me an option beyond our travel dates. A few days before we left, I tried calling and to my surprise they offered us a late evening reservation. We were excited. On the day of, we actually ended up arriving almost 45 minutes early (figured we would walk around if they wouldn't take us but they quickly led us to our table. The restaurant was busy but not as ""tight"" fitting as some of these reviews had led me to believe. We were greeted by an informative waitress who quickly switched to english to deal with us. Sadly for her, it seemed every table that came in after us in her section was American so I felt bad for her as most tables struggled to read the chalkboard menu and needed extensive help. We were crazy enough to bring our teen daughters along but she was sweet and patient with us as we had her make recommendations. We decided to have the girls try sea whelk which they were hesitant about but ended up loving. Then based on a recommendation went with the rib steak (for 2) to split among the four of us as our main entree. We are SOOOO lucky we only got that because the rib steak was so big that even with all 4 of us having some, we actually ended up leaving two slices of the meat that we couldn't finish. The meat was very flavorful and each of us loved it. It came with a smoked sausage that was wonderful. The only complaint was the main dish came with a side that was a baked celery root and it was sooooo salty we could not eat it. Overall, a great experience! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Sedona has alot of potential if realized but some changes need to be made before it gets there... I checked out Sedona yesterday with my Dad for lunch. Being a vegetarian, the first thing he noticed was that they took the vegan burger patty off the menu and replaced it with a caprise paninni sandwich. Unfortantely, adding in large pieces of cheese and a balsamic vinegar glaze to the sandwich isn't really a substitute for a vegetarian burger. I as usual got a the standard 'Cali Club' which I feel like is the only thing you can probably order anywhere and not go wrong. My sandwich was good but not amazing. It seems like they used the thickness of the texas toast slices to make up for not putting in much turkey or bacon into the sandwich. At about $14 I expected a little more. I think one of the issues that really brought down my review rating here was the service. Coming in at around 1pm I noticed that they place was virtually empty. There are maybe two other parties in the main dining area near the bar. However, there a ton of employees (easily out numbering the diners) that were all running around doing something other than serving us. We had to wave down our server to get a ride of ranch and refills on drinks. I think I have stated this in my other reviews, and I'll do it again: I hate having to flag down servers for refills and the check. If we have to go hunt them down, why even have servers? One of the redeeming aspects of Sedona is definitely the place itself. Sedona Lounge is beautiful. The outer architecture and interior design is definitely a step-above the other bar-food restaurants the place is usually compared to. The interior looks like a high-end steak house and the patio is probably one of the nicest in town. Now I have heard some great things about Sedona from friends which makes me want to give the place a second chance. Maybe I went on a off-day or something, it was disappointing after hearing praise from some of my fellow yelpers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I eat here regularly, as you can see by my number of check ins here. This doesn't include the times I just forget to check in lol. I love seeing regular faces here. The home fries are almost as good as Pamela's Diner (in the strip). The breakfast sandwich, however, is my fave!! I actually become sad when it's time to take my last bite. Gotta try this place for breakfast. It's a diner, not a 5 star restaurant. Keep that in mind when visiting. It's not going to have matching linens, plates, and chandeliers, like some people would want. Go to the Grand Concourse for Sunday brunch with Bloody Marys and mimosas.

 My family and I really enjoyed this theater especially the nice and cozy leather lazy boy seats that recline! We took in the 140PM matinee show for just $5 per person you certainly will not be able to watch a new release movie with comfort for that price. The concessions are your typical high AMC prices but with your AMC stubs card you can save some money. I would not recommend going to this theater after matinees as the theaters are rather small and I am sure real crowded hence the reserve seating. AMC is the best value in town when it comes to your traditional theaters. Move over and catch up Harkins. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I don't like giving low star reviews but i'm sorry my experience here was very poor. The two stars are for the food but i would give five for the environment and decorations. When we first came in it was pretty crowded even for a wednesday night at 7:30. They had 2 or 3 open tables but they were too close to other people so we sat at the bar. There was no sign saying please wait to be seated or seat yourself and it appeared that the host was also the waiter and maybe even the cook. Once we sat at the bar a woman greeted us and provided us with menu and asked us what we would like to drink. I asked for a margarita and she said ""do you have tequila."" i didn't understand the question seeing that this was a bar and tequila is what is served in a margarita. Then she says that they don't have a liquor license but if i had brought my own they could prepare one for me. I was completely caught off guard especially since they have bar glasses that hang above their drink station and a whole rack of what are now empty wine bottles. Very misleading..BYOB is cool but don't have a bar look exactly like a bar then tell me you don't serve alcohol, what a rip! They even had one of those rubber drink mats that said Patron tequila on it so what the hell?? Any who, I asked for a virgin margarita that she said she could make and of course after 30 minutes she must have forgot because it never arrived at the table. I decided to just go with a water and one of the bottled mexican sodas, Jarritos. We ordered the avocado fries which was $8 so I assumed we would receive plenty. When the plate arrived it was a measly 6 slices of avocado with salsa evenly placed around a plate on a bed of lettuce. (see photo) I was like WTH is this. $8 for these little slices, It had to be only half of an actual avocado and the fact that i was splitting it with my sister made it even worse. After the app we looked over the menu which appeared to have alot of good choices. I chose the potato flautas and my sister order the curry goat. Each meal came with rice and beans, for mine it was mexican rice and hers was coconut rice. We waited about 15 minutes for our food to arrive and when it finally did boy did it look dry! The rice on both our plates was not moist at all and looked like it had been sitting wayyyy too long on the plate. My dish said it came with sour cream and lettuce which were both missing. I asked for the cream but she didn't even notice that the lettuce was missing. Before she brought my food she told me that they had run out of potato flautas so i said chicken was ok. Expecting chicken in my meal i bit into it and discovered that it was potato. I find it strange that you don't know what dish your serving your customers. The flautas were premade not in the store but probably from a box and they tossed large pieces of shredded cheese on top of the flautas which only partially melted so it just peeled off like dried elmers glue. Thy shell was way to thick and there was almost no potato inside. The beans were flavorless like they came straight out of the can and were just heated. The rice was ok but it also tasted like it came out of a box and had been sitting wayyyy too long. My sisters meal was nothing to rave about either. She ordered the curry goat which once it came to her table was very dry with no curry on it whatsoever. When you think of curry you think of a thai place that makes it like a sauce for your rice. I've had plenty of caribbean food and this curry was not what real curry was supposed to be. they should have said curry flavored instead of curry goat. When she asked for more sauce the waitress went to the kitchen and then returned saying that the curry is prepared with the dish so that there was no extra sauce on the side. WHAT??? How do you not have extra curry when it is essentially a sauce. I mean really people, it was like pulled pork without the BBQ sauce. (see pic) Her rice was dry and flavorless as well. Coconut rice is supposed to be sweet and a lil saucy but this stuff was like steamed white rice you get at a chinese spot. The only thing we ended up enjoying was the guacamole because it was very thick, creamy and had a little spice to it. Other than that all the rest of the food wasn't even worth my taste buds time. My hubby came late and ordered a burrito with marinated pork. they brought out the burrito but with no sauce. He opened it up to see what was inside and it was 90 percent rice and beans and a few spoons of pork shreds. It tasted alot better than our meal but the fact that it came out dry AGAIN just left me shaking my head. After we finished our meal I was ready to pay and go. Unfortunately my hubby was talked in to ordering dessert. I protested but he couldn't resist. he ordered the churros and my sis got one of their truffles. The churros looked great when they came out but they were overcooked. the truffles were nothing to rave about either. Everything was DRY DRY DRY..I won't be going back! ",0,1,0,0,0

 It may be a sin to say this in Pittsburgh, but I am not a big Warhol fan. I do like some of his iconic works like the Soup Cans, but for the most part, his stuff is a bit edgy for me. That being said, I have a Carnegie museum membership so I took advantage and wandered in for a visit. I like that the museum is laid out chronologically. You start at the top floor where you learn about Warhol's early life (and life in Pittsburgh) and as you descent back to the ground floor, you travel through the decades. When I visited, there was a special exhibit on the second floor which was very interesting. It was about an exhibit that was commissioned for the World's Fair and then painted over because of controversy. Fascinating information and ties into the leaders of the time. Of course, one of the favorites is the cloud room because it is so different than any other museum experience. What I didn't like about the museum was the constant feeling that I was being watched. It seemed like their was an inordinate amount of security/staff on every floor that were watching your every move. They didn't greet you or interact, just sort of stared you down. My phone buzzed and I pulled it out to see what it was and they quickly pounced to tell me that no photography was allowed in the museum. They were also dressed in street clothes instead of the usual security guard uniform. It just made me uncomfortable. The cafe has a very limited and pricey menu, but that is to be expected with any museum cafe. The gift shop, though, has an incredible selection of anything and everything Warhol related that you might want, even bugaboo strollers. Overall, an enjoyable experience and a very interesting place and worth the visit. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I stopped in with a party of 6 last week and had a great experience. It was a Tuesday night so we were seated right away. Our server Chelsea took great care of us giving great recommendations from beer, to appetizers, to entrees. I had the 3 meat plate with the baby back ribs, brisket and pulled pork with sides of pecan coleslaw and roasted veggies. I had to stop myself from finishing it because my taste buds were taking priority over my hunger. I was happy I did because I had a great lunch to take to work the next day.

 I've lived at The Cortesian about 2 years now. It is an older complex, but after considering many other Old Town apartment complexes, for the money, it's the best bet. The new management has done a decent job upgrading the place since I've been here too...remodeled laundry rooms, gym, pools, redone asphalt and exterior paint and landscaping. I haven't had any issues with bugs like some other people have mentioned and I would not tolerate creepy crawlies if I did see them. The office and maintenance staff are super dog friendly which is a must for me and even have treats for the pups. The couple times I have had a maintenance request, it has been fixed quickly and my microwave and dishwasher were replaced with brand new units. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is my home from home when I'm working on projects or need to escape the cube farm. Gangplank is a great resource for local techies and creative types. I love the open, collaborative environment and the fact that they actually thought about what people and companies need when they are trying to be productive and get things done.

Next: The podcast studio is a real asset. They modestly claim that it's not as good as they'd like, but stick your head in the door and you'll be blown away. Next-to-Last: Everyone there is fun and welcoming. There's no such thing as a dumb question. Someone is always on hand to chat or bounce around ideas or joke with. Lastly: What's not to like about a place with a pool table, a dart board, and a comfy couch? Hacknights are the place to be on a Wednesday evening if you have a project to work on or you feel like hanging out with some mighty cool peeps and tweeps. :) ",0,0,0,0,1

 I have been going to Sushi Fever for a LONG time. The fish is always fresh, the food is delish, the service is friendly and it is nice and clean. My favorite sushi chef is Lee and the most wonderfuly sweet server is Sung Mi. My favorite rolls are the Sting Man (which is named after my cousin, and you should try it - it's frickin awesome!), and the Ultimate Shrimp with cream cheese, dipped in the Sting Man sauce. My favorite Teppan Grill chef is Masasaki Sasako (I love his name, I think he usually just introduces himself with his taken American name, which I think is George). ",0,0,0,0,1

 A group of us went there a couple of weeks ago. It was a little disappointing. First of all it takes about 4 minutes to go through the whole attraction. The actors found it as cheesy as I did because they had a hard time staying in character. For $ 40 per person there should have at least been a drink included. And as far as the cocktails, watch out! Gratuity is included but the bartenders are hesitant to tell you this. For 3 of us the tab was $45 per round, with tip included, normal for Vegas but a little shady. The only reason I'm giving a second star is because the view from the lounge is good. Would I go back? No. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Let me give you a simple eqation here. school shoes + barrats = public humiliation and segregation from peers. Yep, lets just have a look at this place - lots and lots of cheap and nasty shoes. Poorly designed, poorly made and poorly sold. Poor, poor, poor. The shoes always look like something the school bully would take your lunch money for, which incidently would be more than the cost of the shoes in the first place. This may sound good, but that lunch money, by tomorrow evening will be buying you more shoes from Barrats if it has been raining - as I said, badly made. Not a nice shoe shop. ",0,1,0,0,0

 After taking my two rescue dogs here for about 1year my opinions have changed. They all have been very nice and good to my animals. My dogs get yearly exams, shots, and one teeth cleaning. They have always taken their time with me and answered my questions during the exam. Nice. The two questions two of the vets couldn't answer were not followed up on like they said they would. Not the end of the world. However, this summer I was informed by the office manager and Dr. Varela that he would not be taking either of my dogs into the back without giving the the optional Bordatella shot. Their 'new office policy', sent down from above. They gave a handful of reasons and Varela got uppity and scowly with me so I quickly debated. Went ahead with it because I wanted to get the inexpensive procedure done on one of the dogs that day, and pick up the free coupon RX diet food for the other. Fine. The procedure done on one, two trips into the back room for weights & measuring for the other to get her free food and I was out the door. Do you think I had to pay for a Bordatella for the other dog who went back twice? THEY DIDN'T EVEN ASK! How ""mandatory"" could an optional/voluntary Bordatella shot be if they don't even follow their own regulations? Shouldn't the pet owner be able to decide this? I think all pets should have their legally required shots and surgeries! The rest is at my discretion, as I see the need for. Especially when Bordatella is designed to prevent kennel cough when dogs are boarded. Boarding my dogs? Never! Bordatella shots are currently $10.00 and last 6 months. Each dog X 2 shots yearly per each pet owner = you do the math and watch your pocket book! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I haven't been to Texas in years. But maybe a trip to Allison's Texas BBQ is close enough! Eating barbecue like this is a very special culinary treat. I'm a wee bit grateful it's not too close to me. Otherwise I'd be eating my way out of my leggings. Dangerous! Located in a nondescript shopping center (With copious amounts of signage! Can't be missed) the restaurant is sensible in design. Old school booths line the walls and tables fill the rest. Checkered plastic table cloths add character along with the decided Texas accents. (e.g.Texas flags, cowboy signs.) Looking at the menu my friend and I weren't quite sure what to order. The delightful smell of barbecue wasn't helping. (We were hAngry! It smelled good in there!) Lynn, the manager, suggested we go with the ""Big Tex"" and add onto it. Normally it comes with 3 meats. We upgraded to 4 meats and a small orders of all the sides for $24. So that would be 4 Ribs, Brisket, Pulled Pork, Chicken *and* [deep breath] Corn Souffle, King Ranch Beans, Hill Country Potato Salad, Cole Slaw. It was mm-mm-mm finger licking good! The star in the sides by a stretch was the Corn Souffle. My friend said, ""If I could, I would eat this day and night."" We plastic fork battled over this one. In the meat section I was a fan of all of them. Ribs! Falling off the bone. Chicken! Moist. Pulled Pork! Yes Please! Brisket! Definitely. It's hard to describe enjoying something in words so others can appreciate. With so many options in front of me my biggest issue was the diminishing size of my stomach. My friend and I lightly tasted the pecan pie and chocolate sheet cake. Perfect amount of sweet after gorging ourselves on lunch. However, we couldn't possibly eat everything. A trip to Mesa is worth it! Note there is no alcohol or BYOB. Come prepared to eat! In bulk! Eat here. Your belly will thank you! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I love eggs. I love egg jokes. And I also love a great Eggs Benedict. They delivered! I ordered the Florentine out of desire for something a little more healthy. The food was great as expected, but the food alone didn't make the experience! Our waitress was amazing. She anticipated our needs before we even noticed something was missing (sauces even before the food came out), and even offered me a free muffin because the rest of the party had received one with their meals whereas I had not.

 Every time I think of hummus I think of Bruno confusing it with Hamas. This happens often as hummus has become one of my favorite foods. Naturally I had to try a place that highlights something that is usually just a ""sauce"". The BF and I shared: Baba ganoush ($5.95) they serve you a bowl full. It's creamier than most and more yogurt like. It has a good smoky flavor though and good little bites of eggplant. Hummus, salad, falafel, drink combo ($9.95)- The hummus is good here; it's a smooth and creamy consistency with good flavor. The salad it comes with is cucumber,tomato, onion salad simply dressed with lemon and olive oil. They give you small falafel that is light and crunchy. I prefer a softer, denser lightly crunchy ball. The pita accompany it is fluffy and great. They offer a ""free salad bar"" and it's not what I think when I hear that word. It's more accompaniments than dinner salad. It was more like pickled carrots, pickled spicy cauliflower, red cabbage slaw, radishes, hot sauce, stewed tomatoes making up the spread. Everything was fresh, homemade tasting and went well with the baba and hummus. The portions were generous since we took home enough for a snack later. There are trays of sweets so we were curious to try some. I ended up getting a orange blossom water infused baklava square and the BF got one that was plain with a cherry on top. The chef (presumably owner) gave us a bag of little crunchy balls covered in the same type of syrup as the baklava. Everything was pretty good, but small. It was $1.99 for a two bite piece so while the meal is a deal of a price the desserts aren't. It's a basic little place and the staff was pretty nice. One interesting plus is there is a sink outside the bathroom for washing hands. I think if you are seeking a fresh meal this is a great spot. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I haven't been to this venue since it was the Fontana Bar, and WOW, what a difference!! I was a bit peeved at the wait time in line, especially since we had a table, but once we got in, things were good. This is the club with the best view in Vegas, that's for sure. The music was great, and we had a good time. The only other issues we had were minor ones: 1) We had a table on the outside portion of the club- and the ceiling fans weren't working! It made for a pretty hot (not in a good way) time, especially since we were dancing. 2) The cocktail waitress wasn't all that speedy or attentive. We made our own drinks several times because she was nowhere to be found. The music and the view, especially when the fountains are going, made up for it, though. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I read rave reviews about this place and it was 2 blocks from my hotel, so i had to check it out! The NY accent is definitely thick and abounds in there! The menu is huge! The specials are indeed all over the place! I went with the turkey special and spaced when ordering it and got a wrap... Not that yummy bread that everyone speaks so highly of. I couldn't believe it as it existed my mouth... sigh. It was made fresh right in front of me, and i even had a choice for the wrap - wheat, spinach, tomato or something else... woah! There are cute tables out front, unfortunately a family of about 15 small children bogarted it for the entire time i was there. The light rail passes by and luckily is not very loud. I would definitely be here frequently if i lived here, but alas, i am just passing through! If you are attending a conference walk the 4 blocks down Adams, skip quiznos and subway and enjoy a great sandwich! And try the meatball sub - it looked amazing! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Five big stars. Derek and his crew crushed it tonight (and from what I understand, every night) with a menu wide open to the chef's open mind. We said a) we are creative eaters and b) we are hungry.

Great beers and local wines available; super view of the kitchen, rad music selection courtesy of whoever is picking the music. It was a stunning meal. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was really excited to try this place. Was a little disappointed when I looked online and found out it was a chain. The atmosphere was fun, a lot of people, but I wish the music was a little lower. I don't know if I was fighting the loud music or the loud people (maybe a combination of both) but I found myself yelling across the table to talk to my 3 friends. Our waitress was nice. But she would disappear 15 minutes at a time. I don't think I've ever waited that long for a water. Then it took another 30 minutes to get my appetizer. I didn't order anything else because I wanted to get out of there before midnight. Then the food was ok. I unfortunately didn't get the chance to try the pizza. I only got a pretzel appetizer - which basically tasted like salt. My friends seemed to enjoy their meals more than I. The only reason that I would return here soon is after a night of drinking on Mill. Maybe I'll try it again in 3 months once things get better established, at which point I will hopefully have the opportunity to revise this review. ",0,1,0,0,0

The veggie samosa was very good, spicier than most I've had, the chicken tikka masala was good and the aloo matter ( they spelled it mutter) was alright too, but the mixed tandoori was quite a disappointment..little pieces of chicken, lamb and ONE prawn which they forgot to actually put on the plate and brought it out later!

 I found this BBQ place through Yelp. Location: We went at night, not a well lit parking lot or lit sign, we were near a lot of strip clubs, but the lot was full, so we decided to peek inside. Service: You get in a line, order and pay, and hope to find a seat. The wait was an hour to get our food. People who ordered after us got served before us, which was maddening. The staff brings your food, but that is all. Food: Big portions! Had that good BBQ flavor and they had 2 different sauces you could use. Overall: Staff could be a little friendlier and more helpful with ordering, maybe implement a seating system, and invest in some signage for the street that is lit for when its dark. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My husband and I honeymooned in Vegas and stayed at the Aria for four evenings. We were not impressed and won't stay there again. Upon check-in, they couldn't find our reservation and when they did locate what they needed, only had smoking rooms available when we specifically said no smoking. The clerk needed to find out what she could do and brought over a manager which at time this time, both ladies turned their backs to us while ""discussing"" the rooms. Eventually they sorted out the issue, whatever it was. One compliment that I will give Aria is that they did upgrade us to the 50th floor with a fabulous view, due to the inconvenience. During the rest of our stay, my poor husband kept being called by my last name each time he had to call for service, and on our honeymoon, that is a bummer, especially when this was the first trip as man and wife and I'm taking his name. We corrected them at each opportunity but it was never corrected in their system. Biggest oops of Aria was no room service after our first evening. Hubby and I went on a LONG Grand Canyon tour. We left the hotel at seven in the morning and returned close to ten in the evening and the room was exactly as we left it. This was the biggest let down of all, in all my years traveling and staying in all types of hotels I have never came back to a ""messy"" room. I will give Aria 2 stars due to the beautiful rooms, awesome (roomy) baths and incredible view. The casino is beautiful, has a sweet aroma which is much different than usal casino smell and the city center is fun. I hope that maybe since the Aria is fairly new the customer service will be fine tuned and the little details worked out because it is too pretty a hotel to miss out on, but with the nightly rate, the bar must be raised.

 I am sad to say I was very disappointed by their hotel service... Upon arrival we were told that the 700sqft suite with two queen beds we reserved was unavailable because of the hotel being over booked. So we were downgraded to a 500sqft suite with two queen beds... We were comp'ed six wrist bands for Rehab and received $100 off our first nights stay and told to call in the morning for a room change. The next morning I was told that our room would not be available for the rest of the weekend but we could take a 700sqft suite with one king bed... because we had four people staying in the room we opted to stay in the smaller suite but because we had booked the larger suite we were told that no matter which room we took we would still have to pay for the 700sqft suite for the remaining two nights... we were appalled!!! After a long conversation we decided to take the larger suite and resorted to sleeping on floors and couches because the hard rock does not have pull out couches and never sent the roll away to our room even after repeated requests... On the up side the rooms were AMAZING and the pool was gorgeous but our stay was ruined by the lack of service... BEWARE: if you book a room with two queen beds you are NOT guaranteed two queen beds... you are given what's available upon arrival no matter how many people are staying in the room!!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've been to this Fuel Pizza before and would have given it an extra star, but this time around, have to give it a 2. Reason being, my slice of pepporoni was floating in grease. Now on the other hand my slice of just cheese was fine, so I guess if you don't add any kind of meat on the pizza, you'll probably be alright. But, you can't judge a pizza parlor by just it's pizza, can you? The garlic knots were warm and fresh, with just enough garlic, served with a wonderful, tomatoey, garlic, oregano and basil laced dipping sauce. It was so good, I dipped my puffy pizza crust end in it just to have something to sop it up with. My friend ordered a side salad with her slice and the caesar dressing. I took a swipe off of her dressing lid, and mmmmm, it was very good...didn't know if it was homemade, or a really great bottled dressing you pay an arm and a leg for at Harris Teeter. Since this particular Fuel is housed in was once a filling station, there's lots of old auto memorabilia as well as .....well...memorabilia of all sorts. There's also lots of customer decorated paper plates on the wall and some of them are really creative and artistic.....must be lots of NODA customers going there! And, the prices are good and the staff were very nice and quick! It may have been an off day for them, and I expected better, but if I were that way again, I would probably order a pie to go, sans the pepperoni.

 Let me start out by saying that I am very skeptical of ""celebrity"" restaurants and this visit thoroughly confirmed my prejudice. We came here for Mother's Day brunch. E2 does not normally serve brunch, except for special occasions so I was both wary and excited to give it a try. We made reservations for 11:30 and then tried to switch them a day before to noon but we're told it was booked solid. We arrived at 11:30 and there were maybe only 3 tables sat. Come 12:00 maybe only about 3 more...frustrating. We ordered our drinks about 20 minutes in advance hoping they'd come out right at 12 (liquor laws) like many other Charlotte restaurants do. We were wrong. Apparently, they only had one girl working the bar and it took until about 12:15 to finally get our drinks. I ordered the bloody mary and was extremely displeased. It tasted like the bartender poured mix (zing zang) and vodka and did nothing to spruce it up. I sent it back and 15 minutes later I received a terribly peppered and butchered drink. Should have ordered something off the specialty cocktail menu. As for the food. The rolls were nothing special...definitely not made in house. We had a few questions about how things were served. I asked two waiters about the shrimp and grits and both told me there was no sauce on the dish. Another at the table ordered it and...you guess it...there was a sauce. Darn, wish I had ordered it. We ordered a plate of the peanut butter and banana stuffed French to the table, which was delicious (how could you mess that up?). I ordered the croque madame which had a funny taste to it that I couldn't quite put my finger on. The creole mornay sauce was inexistent and I was craving something saucy to break up the monotony of flavor. The fries that came on the side were delicious. The biscuit in the biscuits of gravy tasted like Pillsbury dough and were overcooked on the bottom. I was really hoping E2 would end my celebrity restaurant skepticism but, unfortunately, even my low expectations were not met. Perhaps it was because they aren't used to serving brunch? Who knows - but regardless - not an excuse in my book. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I came here for lunch yesterday with my dad and stepmom. Firstly, the decor certainly didn't ""wow"" me. I was expecting prices for lunch ranging $8-15 considering the decor and paper table covers. We ordered the chopped salad, the chicken and waffles and the scallops. Firstly, our waiter was ho-hum, and not prompt with service. Our meals ranged from $14-16 and were SO small we all left absolutely starving. The chicken and waffles was HALF of ONE waffle with one SMALL chicken breast. My dad's scallops came out undercooked and by the time they came back after he sent them back, we had finished eating. (15 minute wait to recook scallops?!) They didn't offer from fresh ones and sent back his original ones which were all cut in half. Appalling. Dad then ate by himself and we weren't offered any compensation nor any appetizer free of charge considering we were waiting for him to finish. The flavor was good but this is the most OVERPRICED, SMALL-PORTIONED food I have ever encountered in such an establishment that isn't a 5 star restaurant. So disappointing. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It's interesting to read through all the reviews and find myself mirroring a lot of the other comments. Pros: It's so adorable to look at, the decor is amazing and everything seems very clean. They are relatively accommodating in terms of scheduling appointments. They discard the files after one use. Cons: The quality on 2 of my 3 trips was so bad. I get better mani/pedis at my hole in the wall $30 place. So expensive! My techs were always complaining about something. I have to admit, I haven't been here for about a year but I find myself wanting to go back when I visit AZ to give it ONE. MORE. CHANCE. One of my friends blogs about Phoenix spas and salons and she suggested I try Sundrops out. Aesthetically it cannot be beaten. I fell in love with it the second I stepped in. After that my love affair faded. The first nail tech I had on my first trip was amazing but I haven't seen him there since. I was a little taken aback when I had to pay such a high price in the end, but it was worth it and it was a nice infrequent treat I would allow myself. The next 2 times I went, however, I hated my techs and my french manicures looked like I had done them myself. I want to like this place so badly and I think that is why I keep returning to try it over and over. I think, however, I may just have to give up and try somewhere else. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Wow. Great sushi! All you can eat for 26 bucks! Make sure to get your money's worth! I came her with my girlfriend and got AYCE and we got a lot of half rolls and figured the price of the meal would just come out to the price of AYCE. We sat at the sushi bar and had Fredo(?) as our sushi chef. Really cool guy and really friendly. He recommended things to use and everything tasted great. YOU MUST get the grilled cajun salmon! It only comes in a small bit size so order about two for yourself. The chocolate moose was the only desert we tried and it was amazing. Also get the grilled veggies. Whatever butter they put is really tasty!! The server was great too. There's about three that bus the sushi bar and grab drinks and one of them takes your order that doesn't get made by the sushi chefs. Super quick service! If you do AYCE 10 times you get the 11th free! Oh and a Sunday night the wait was about 45 minutes for two people. The place is small and super packed. Make sure to say you will sit in either a booth or table so if either opens up you'll get seated faster ",0,0,0,0,1

 If you want to feel thin and beautiful, come stand in line and look at the people waiting here. Just kidding. Seriously though, this place attracts some people who should consider laying off the deep fried delicacies. This place was the first time in my life that I've had a fried Twinkie. Yet, somehow I feel like the people that I saw here regularly indulge. I don't think the hot dogs looked all that great. In fact, I would suggest skipping the savory items altogether, and going straight towards the dessert options. I give this shop props for scratching deep fried Twinkies off my bucket list. 99 cents for the Twinkie was a bargain. This sub-500 calorie treat was DELICIOUS. It was perfection: crunchy on the outside, melting and warm on the inside, and gloriously sweet with the generous pour of powdered sugar over it. The ecstasy lasted a few bites. Then, I started to feel the effects of my arteries clogging, which happened concurrently with my blood sugar spike. By the time I finished it, I regretted eating the whole thing. I would recommend sharing, lest you similarly experience glutton's remorse. At the end of the day, this little shack has: zero ambiance, Midwestern-esque clientele, mediocre savory items, but completely indulgent dessert options. What's not to love? ",0,0,0,1,0

 I had to call here today cause I had a question about my pug... he's been a little sick poor guy. Anyways the lady promptly got me a vet tech on the phone. She was very helpful. She didn't tell me to rush my dog in like some places would do. She gave me a lot of tips and signs on when I would need to actually bring him into the vet. Thanks for the comfort and help guys!

 Love this new place! Since we got siked out from the Wineyard being only open on Fridays which is a bummer, we were looking for a Tuesday night Happy Hour. Heard about this opening and so glad we went. Service and food were amazing! Plus it's so cute! It was a perfect night to dine outside. And while no happy hour, the prices are very reasonable. We had 2 flatbreads which were both really good. One with quail egg, spinach abs cheese, so yummy! The other was a shrimp, cilantro and bean one, also very delicious. Fries with garlic aioli was my fav, I will crave these and must go back! The wine was perfectly chilled as we'll and everyone who greeted and served us was super nice! Definitely going back, will be a regular :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 Believe both the good and the not so good o the reviews for Nacho Daddy's. Service was very slow for a Saturday night at 8pm. The introductory corn muffins were tasty but I would have preferred chips and salsa considering how slow the service was. We had a pitcher of the house margaritas which were heavy on the sweet and sour and seemed light on the alcohol. I had the spicy shrimp nachos and my g/f had the mexi Cobb salad. The shrimp were the tiny shrimp which lacked any real taste. Her salad seemed fine, both portions were good sized. Overall, not great value, fair food but nothing special. ",0,1,0,0,0

 * Inspired by Charlton L. to not to be lazy and finally write this. :] My first time here was back in November 2008 when a group of friends and I went on a celebratory Vegas trip. It was our last night in Vegas and we collectively decided to eat at the Wynn buffet since we were going to party at Tryst. It's an amazing buffet! I was seriously thanking myself for not wearing some skin tight outfit because I would have been popping out of it! However, walking around all ""dressed up"" (and some what skimpy with killer heels) around families and little kids was a bit awkward. But hey, who cares when there is all you can eat King Crab legs and an amazingly large assortment of food, right?! The food was good. I ate to my heart's content.. and to my stomach capacity and it was worth it. The only downside to this buffet that I found was the dessert. They all looked so amazingly delicious and oh so cute (mini sizes/portions) but they really didn't taste the way they looked. I think I only liked one thing out of the whole lot :(. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Whatever you do, get the Adobo Fried Rice here. It was the first time I tried adobo style fried rice and it was good! Actually, most of the food here was good. My only exception would probably be the Chicken Adobo which wasn't bad or anything, but it just wasn't as good as other chicken adobo's I've had before. The portions here are generous and the environment...well, a lot better than most Filipino restaurants outside of a resort in the Philippines. It's clean here, and a nice sit down and dine restaurant. We ordered the following: Chicken Adobo, $7.95, -OK Miki-Bihon, $7.95, -Good Ala Carte Lechon Kawali, $8.95, -Excellent Ox Kare Kare, $10.95, -Good Adobo Fried Rice, $6.95, -Ridiculously Good Salo-Salo Grill is a little pricier when you compare it with the Filipino buffets in Vegas, but the food and look of the restaurant make up for it. Plus, they have a little hut outside, in the parking area, where you can smoke. How Filipino is that? Customer service was OK despite the other reviews I read about it being not to good. I didn't like the fact that the waitress stood next to our table though when she dropped off the check. She stayed there till we put out the payment, a 'hunny'. It was annoying! Someone from my table said it's just the way some of us from certain islands are...I don't know which island she was referring about but it still irritated me nonetheless. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Well you shouldn't really expect too much from airport Chinese food, honestly. It will be expensive, it will be filled with grease, and you have to be really careful with picking what to eat because most of the food available will not taste good. I got fried rice, mixed vegetables and green beans. The fried rice was bland, the veggies were edible, but I thought that the green beans tasted quite decent. Granted I love green beans, it's really hard to mess them up, and I hadn't eaten anything for over 10 hours and I was starving. Ended up paying a little over $8 for all of this. I didn't think it was too too bad as I didn't have high expectations in the first place, but I wish I had read the yelp reviews beforehand; I'd have gone too BK or chilli's. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Nice to be able to see a movie for under $10. (adult: $8.50, senior: $6, child: $6, matinee: $6) It may not be as updated as the bigger, newer, glitzier theaters in the area, but we still enjoy going here, especially for a Sunday matinee. With 10 theaters, there's usually a decent movie selection. While I am not a frequenter of movie concession stands, it seems like they have all the basics. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is all coming from a girl who just needs a relatively clean place, a bed that isn't concrete, air conditioning and running water in Vegas. I don't need pretty, I don't need all that snotty stuff. So I was originally going to stay at the Sahara... that's where I usually stay... it's cheap, easy, and on the strip. But I saw the prices were comparable here (average of $50 a night, holiday weekend) and decided to give this place a try. Things I like about this place: ~ You actually win in this casino. My only thought is that it's like that because it's not on the strip. ~ The $1.50 Bud/BudLight/Bud Lime! The best thing about the whole place. The other beers cost $5.50. Yikes. ~ Photos of hot chicks everywhere. Funny tho... I didn't actually see any hot chicks. Except the one chick running cocktails to the gamblers... but she was the only one. ~ The beds are pretty soft and comfy. Pillows leave something to be desired tho. Bring your own if you are picky about your pillows. ~ The view I had... I was in the Oceanview tower and I wasn't facing the pool... I was facing the strip. So I had this great view of the Luxor, New York New York, MGM, Excalibur... it was nice. Things that left me wondering ""WTF?"": ~ The drainage issues, as mentioned in other reviews. ~ The batting in the comforter on the bed was all weird... it's like it was a duvet that wasn't properly attached or something. ~ The parking garage elevators. I swear, we thought we were going to die in those things by falling through the floor or something. All in all... it was a great trip. In fact, I would choose this place over the Sahara. The location is great. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Small cute vegan place in what looks like a warehouse building. I ordered the beet brag burger and my husband got the avocado sandwich. I also ordered eggplant bacon. Everything was to perfection, I actually wished I got the avocado because was so good!! There's a lot of rosemary in it which made it even more delicious. The beet burger was on a toasted bun and the waitress brought out homemade ketchup they made that day, finger licking good! The eggplant bacon is eggplant that is roasted to a crisp..soooo gooood!!!

 Tres cool! Figo! This is a very cool, little-known place with tasty food, cheap (good) wine, and very friendly staff. Johnny & co.'s friendly, trilingual (French, English, Italian) greeting immediately warms you to the place. Their thin crust pizza is wonderful! Ask for the *salsa piccante* that brings a *Blue* (sorta Gorg) pizza to new heights! Their house wine is a fine accompaniment to the pizza and their *caffe'* can close out the meal with a satisfied smile. The place is friendly (locals drop by for a quick coffee and chat about the last Habs game), clean, and has a warm feeling in the afternoon. We'll be back asap. Once the *terrasse* opens, we'll be shading ourselves under one of their patio umbrellas with pizza and house wine while the Vespa cools down after all the local food shopping!

 So I wish one of these airports I frequent would have a nice mexican restaurant. But that is impossible. Short and sweet: Good: The steak quesadilla was alright. The tacos looked crappy. the burrito seemed nice enough. I enjoyed the marinade for the steak. Eh: Big blue moon beer was $7.50. A decent price knowing you are in an airport Bad: The margaritas are $15! $10 for the ""house"" one, that looked pretty weak. I sat at the bar, and I have to say I haven't been appalled by a worker/manager in a long time. You know those managers that makes everyone worried and feel uncomfortable as an employee because God forbid you spill a beer or drop a napkin, he's gonna rip your face off! He would compain/yell/super sarcastic remarks to everyone working. And quite loud and openly. He ruined my mood. I really could have enjoyed a beer and decent quesadilla if it wasn't for him.

 This place is just OK. I've been here twice. The first time, I had dol sot bi bim bap (it was decent - you really can't mess this dish up though!). The second time, I had sulung tang (beef stew - kind of like ox tail stew), and it was bad. The broth was too fatty (it was totally white! Usually, it's milky but slightly clear), and very bland (we had to put a LOT of salt in it). My friend got the soon doo boo and said it was just OK - nothing special. I'd go here again if I had absolutely no choice, but I'd prefer a different Korean restaurant... ",0,1,0,0,0

 Came here thinking there is a 25% chance that I'd be disappointed because of all the hype and being from Oakland where there is so much bomb ass cheap Thai food. Nope, 99% satisfied. The 1% is portions are on the smaller side, especially given how expensive each dish was. On to food: Crispy duck panang- no joke, this is absolutely ridiculously delicious! It isn't spicy and is a type of red curry. Drizzle on rice and take a bite of the duck=heaven. Crispy rice (nam kao tod)- so so so so so good. Order your own, so good you don't want to share. Perfect amount of spice and leaves a good citrus tang at the end of each bite Drunken noodle with beef- I originally wanted the one with soft shell crab but they didn't have any on the night I went :( The beef is pretty standard and so were the noodles. Not that it was bad but since everything else was amazing, this is pretty standard Tiger prawn wrapped in bacon and wonton wrappers- pretty average. I mean it's good cuz its a tiger prawn wrapped in bacon and wonton but nothing unique. I'd suggest saving space for the other better things. Thai tea- hard to mess this one up overall but pretty damn good. The tea they used is brewed pretty strong and I can tell cuz it leaves the bitter tea after taste but that's how I like it Tip: Make a reservation! Guaranteed during prime dinner time you'll wait 45-60min. I called for reso a month ago and the convo went like this, ""I'd like to make reservations. We are all booked tonight! It's actually for next month. Ok, your name and number. And don't be more than 5 min late or we give away your table!"" This should show you that they are so popular that they DO NOT NEED YOU. Along with that, when I arrived, this is what happened, I walked in and said hi, immediate response was, it is an hour wait! ok but I have reservations....oh ok, wait here. Then I was seated in 5 min. Lesson of the story, make a reso! The line may be busy, keep trying and trying again, it's worth it! ",0,0,0,0,1

 The stars are for our server who was very nice. The food was bad, not going to sugar coat it. We each got a buffalo chicken wrap and shared nachos.

 Located in the lobby of the Hilton Suites in downtown Phoenix, I was fully unimpressed with their hotel restaurant. In contrast to the beautiful atmosphere of the restaurant, the food was pretty lousy. From my room I could just smell the bacon in the morning so I had to come downstairs and give this place a try. The restaurant is buffet style for breakfast. The food was barely warm and hard as a rock. The quality of the food was much worse than the free breakfasts that come complimentary at other hotel chains such as La Quinta. At least the service was good. I think they refilled my drink after each sip I took! They must have known I was going to need it to wash that food down. I'll give 2 stars only because the service was great and the atmosphere was pleasant. ",0,1,0,0,0

 As a whole, ASC is a great science museum. The Body Worlds exhibits first struck me as a little macabre, but after experiencing them, found it extremely interesting and educational. My only suggestion would be that they update the permanent exhibits a little more often. We go about twice a year, which keeps it interesting for my young daughter, but my wife and I are tired of seeing the same old same old time and time again. For what they charge for admission, I'd expect more in this respect. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I feel the Days Inn Tempe is best described as ""a place where you can purchase the right to sleep for awhile."" I booked my 10-night stay on Travelocity for a non-smoking room, yet when I entered the room I almost choked. It was disgusting. I've never had a smoking hotel room before and I will make sure I don't again. They said they couldn't move us to a different room. My local lady friend brought over a bottle of wine but forgot a corkscrew. No big deal, I thought to myself, as the front desk of a hotel will surely have a corkscrew. Nope. Coors Light it is. The towels felt like they were made of cow tongue, and they missed our wakeup call one morning making me late for a training class that had cost me about $500. I'm awarding one star in addition to the minimum one-star rating because I got to drink cheap beer by the pool in 90 degree weather for 10 days, and there are a few good places to eat and two dollar stores very nearby. The dollar store had a corkscrew. ",0,1,0,0,0

 On the way back to our hotel after dinner and saw a sign that said $3 dollar craps(only during certain hours, not the whole day) which is extremely hard to find on or near the strip. The westin isn't exactly on las vegas blvd so it might be a little hard to find but it's across the street from bally's and next to bill's gambling hall which is now being renovated. We decided to stop by and play. The casino is pretty small but I was okay with the size because it wasn't so busy. If you wanted to play bj, craps, or roulette you can just walk in and play w/o waiting which is pretty cool. A lot of people associate the westin as just a hotel and not a casino so maybe that's why it wasn't so busy. Anyways, the reason I give it two stars is because I had a problem with the crap's dealer in particular a woman. She was extremely unethical and misleading. She would try to look for newbies and take advantage of them. She would help them play and at the same time tell them to put a couple dollars down thinking it's a bet that you made but what she was really doing was making bets for herself. For example, if the button was on 8 she would say give me 4 dollars to put on hard 8, but what she did was put 2 dollars on hard 8 for you and she would put 2 dollars on hard 8 for her. When the button is off she would say give me 4 dollars to put on yo (11) she would put $2 dollars for you and put $2 for herself. She was doing this throughout the whole night to this couple. I play craps a lot so I know how to bet she tried to do the same to me but I caught her and moved away so she can stop hustling me and stealing my money to make bets for herself. She is a pretty attractive lady, she had an accent so I think she is from Europe or something. Watch out for her. She is very sneaky. You may think she is being nice and trying to help you make bets but really she is just making bets for herself. I played crap's at almost every major casino on the strip as well as the old strip and never has any dealer been this unethical and stealing money from people. I feel bad for the couple she took advantage of and all of the other customers she took advantage of. Hopefully, the pitt boss finds out what she is doing and has her stop. Out of the 4-5 dealers at the crap's table she was the only one asking money from people to place bets for herself/dealers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 VIBE The decor at Le Cartet is awesome. Cool castor-esque light bulbs hang down from the ceilings. Cool cut outs of maps are on the wall and big pots of poinsettas are in the back. I can see it's a buzzy type of place for brunch/lunch. I came for lunch but where Le Cartet really misses out is on its service. I was not greeted. I was not asked normal things like: would you like something to drink? I had to ask for the specials. I ATE I had the salmon sandwich. It was a decent sandwich but I assumed I'd have slices of salmon as opposed to it being a creamy mishmash of a tuna melt. It was solid food but way overpriced with a measley green salad for $15. OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK Le meh. That said, I would come back if I'm directly in the area for ambiance or to buy something in the market. Otherwise, it's a bit on the edge of Old Montreal and out of the way for something that is ho-hum. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Stopped in for a late lunch/brunch. She had meatloaf, mashed potatoes, gravy and fried okra. I had corned beef hash, hash browns and eggs over easy. The ""meat"" loaf barely qualified as meat. It had the consistency of mush and absolutely no meat, onion or any flavor except maybe condensed milk??? Odd flavor and texture. The mashed potatoes and gravy had the same odd flavor. As I said the closest flavor may have been canned condensed milk. She didn't finish it and sent it back. The fried okra was ok. My hash browns and eggs were fine. Pretty hard to mess up! The corned beef hash looked ok, but the only thing I could taste was onion. I like onion, but it had NO corned beef flavor at all.

 Jean Philippe is full of candy, both for the eyes as well as the stomach. Equipped with a Crepe station and a glass counter overflowing with what looks to be art more so than food the patisseries are complex and rightly so. Patisserie is Jean's claim to fame. I gave JP's 5 stars. Based not on the crepes, which are great by all accounts, and neither did i give the pastries consideration. These 5 stars are for making what may be the finest Croissant available in France or otherwise AND for selling the finest prosciutto panini I have had the pleasure of enjoying. Here's the Skinny: The Croissant : I have had many in my life, most have been pretty good. I mean it seems a simple item right? The croissants from JP reminded me that simple is sublime. The crust was golden, sweet, & crisp. The inside soft, warm, simple. If JP's was the Matrix the Croissant would named ""Neo"". The Panini : JP does not make the prosciutto panini that is so, so, worthy of these 5 stars. Truth be told they just throw it on the panini press. The sandwiches themselves arrive each day from somewhere presumably in the Las Vegas area. Should I ever find out their origin said companies delivery boy will have an additional stop on his route.

 The sale/price/trade all went smoothly. The salesman proundly presented a clean carfax. The car has been good except: 1. a google search of the vin revealed that the front bumper, front fender, doors, and rear fender had all been replaced at the auction house (manheim) apparently to escape Carfax. All of this was on the sales slip from Manheim. The sales guy had to know, although he claimed the buyer never told him. Slick. 2. after a flat tire, it was discovered the spare was missing. after maybe 10 phone calls, and another 10 emails, several visits, and a month, a new wheel (non matching) and tire were provided. 3.

 This is another one we found on Yelp Mobile. Sometimes you read short Yelp reviews and they don't help you at all. But Erika B.'s post on 11-5-09 couldn't have been on the money in describing Jason's Deli: ""I try to stay away from chains, but I went here with [family] and liked it ... The order line is kinda unorganized which made it a little confusing."" That was exactly our experience here, too. We escaped Red Rock and headed towards the Rampart-Charleston row of chain restaurants and retailers, maybe 10 blocks of regional and national eateries to choose from. Of the 30-40 choices, Jason's seemed a good lunch destination for the family. To add to Erika B's post, Jason's has a good selection of sandwich meat and hot lunch choices, and their French roll tasted fresh and was the right crispiness. The salad bar looked ok, and the dozen soup choices should please any palate. The half-sandwich/soup combo I ordered was a good lunch deal, with the chili I chose being slightly more watery than meaty, but still good. If you have the will-power to pass on the $2 drinks and sodas, you can do well here for your lunch money. ",0,0,0,1,0

Vegetable curry is the cheapest, and they give you barely any vegetables, so order a side. The curry sauce is great at hot level, and the meat is cooked very well. Soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, unless doused in curry. Give this place a try, it deserves more business ",0,0,0,0,1

 UPDATE -- Received a second arrangement from here, and it was our last. When my fiance brought it home it looked so horrific I asked where he got it from, assuming he would say the grocery store or somewhere putting out sub-par florals, and when he told me the place I couldn't believe it. And lets just be clear, I am NOT picky about flowers - AT ALL. I sent a photo to several friends and they all said they looked horrible. Of course I called and explained, brought it back the next day and they re-did it. But I feel like twice in a row is two times too many. Especially when you're paying at least $40 an arrangement - for dead flowers. I would have given them 1 star but they were polite about it and offered to replace the arrangements - which was inconvenient and defeated the purpose, but courteous nonetheless. Original Review-- My boyfriend brought home an arrangement on Friday and it didn't make it through the weekend, I was so disappointed because the arrangement was beautiful! I called Karin and she apologized and replaced my flowers the next day! She was sure to ask my favorite flowers, colors, style - and my new flowers are just as gorgeous if not more than the last. It's unfortunate the first set didn't last, but I was overly impressed by her concern and desire to make it right. You can't beat that kind of customer service. ",0,1,0,0,0

 After hearing all the hype about this place from my friends, a group of us went to Genghis Friday night after the movies and lets just say I wasn't impressed. I love the whole Mongolian grill concept, and do frequent YC's every few months, but friends had been telling me Genghis puts YC's to shame. We walked in aand while walking to the table couldn't help by notice that all our shoes were sticking the floor, I was thinking dang when was the last time they mopped was. So we got to our tables and being the 1st time to this place for most of us, we kind of looked lost, but a kind lady at the booth next to explained the processes and told us to grab the bowl and get started. Granted Genghis does have more of meet selection then YC's but YC's has more vegetables to choose from. The bowl that you use to get place your meats and veggies is pretty small so pack wisely; I would have loved to place more veggies but just didn't have the room. When going down the line, the areas were not clean, there was veggies misplaced everywhere and seasonings scattered all around Service was slow & along with the sticky floor our table was very sticky as well, didn't want to place anything on top of the table. Dinner was brought to us, and yes the food did taste well. I had the surf and turf with noodles but Im thinking if I go another time I would do without the crab. I don't think I would be going out of my way to come back to this place; I was turned off by the messy appearance, sticky floor & table. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My fifth visit to Paris and for the first time I was a little disappointed. Although the staff was as friendly and as courteous as ever, I did not appreciate being charged an early arrival fee (especially since I had paid a premium fee for my second night -- apparently there was a convention booked.) I had two meals at Ile St Louis, the sidewalk cafe-style restaurant, and was disappointed with both. Though the duck was advertized on the menu as being accompanied by ""rosemary polenta"", rather a treat, at least to me, it arrived with mashed potatoes and a half-assed apology from the waiter. Undaunted, the next morning I ordered the Eggs Benedict, but they were unbelievably salty, almost inedible. (On my third morning I walked up to the Venetian for breakfast.) I am also irritated that the ""smoking rooms"" are all on the fourth floor, with no possible chance of a view of anything. Smokers are NOT second class citizens and should NOT be treated as such! If things have not improved, after my next visit I will find a different hotel in which to stay. But I will miss the ambience of ""Paris"". I do like the Casino which is large enough to make one feel like one is ""on the Strip"", but small enough so you don't need a cell phone to find your traveling companion. The entrances are convenient, the location is superb, and the staff is congenial if, in some cases, not particularly helpful. I will HATE having to find a new favorite place to stay in Las Vegas, but find one I most definitely will. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Pretty good place. The rolls are colossal. The bites were so big they need to cut the rolls in half longways. Good rice for good price. You defiantly get a lot of food for the price. Good atmosphere. Good food. Had spicy mussels that were delish. Come hungry leave happy. ",0,0,0,1,0

 It used to be great, but they've been skimping on portions and the quality of rice they use is subpar at best. Hopefully they will change that because this was our spot to eat whenever we go to Vegas. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It is a fun roller coaster but not worth $14 a person!! That's half the admission price for a full day to Six Flags. Guess they have a captive audience. They have always offered a 2-for-1 locals discount but didn't offer that when we rode this weekend. If I didn't have an out-of-town guest with me, I would've walked away. It's a rough ride but fun nonetheless. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I try to go to this location each time I visit Vegas and that has been about 10 times since this location opened. This is the western most location in the U.S. and closest to my hometown in CA. What I like most about Steak n Shake is that it is between a sit down diner like Denny's to a great fast food burger joint like In N Out. The problem with this location is that it is always busy. Both the take-out and dine-in line is always long and I have waited no less than 20 minutes each time. The crazy thing is that I always try to come at off-time hours like 2-4pm. This time while I waited in line I saw that as tables were cleared/cleaned and ready for new customers, it would take the hostess an additional 5-10 minutes to seat people. Often times there were 3 tables empty and it was just a slow hostess. In her defense, I think they are very short staffed at this location and always have too few employees to customers. After 20 minutes we were seated and since I had been here many times, I didn't even need to look at the menu...I knew exactly what I wanted. My server came within 2-3 minutes and said that she would be right with us. It was another 5 minutes before she came. After ordering, the food took another 20 minutes!! The cooks must be short staffed as well!! Between standing in line and getting our food, it was almost 1 hour! I have been to many Steak n Shake locations in the midwest (St. Louis) and have never experienced anything like what I experience at this location. I ordered my usual Frisco Burger and my brother had the double stack with cheese. I also ordered a Carmel Turtle Shake and a soda to go down with it. If you have never been here before, you need to know that the burger patties are extremely thin. Half the size of In N Out and 1/4 the size of Carl's Jr. If you want a burger that will resemble the amount of food in a Double-Double (from In n Out) then you need to at least order the triple stack burger! The fries that come with the burger are also extremely skinny, which I like, because they are extra crispy! The carmel turtle shake came in a large shake glass as usual, but this time there was no excess silver blending cup! When did this change?? Budget Cuts??? You have to get a shake when you come here. It is called Steak n Shake for a reason! Another weird thing that I have never experienced before was they kept taking chairs from our table while we were eating. We were two people, seated at a table for four. While we were eating, they took our chair to add to another table. That was fine. Then 5 minutes later they came back and took the other one too! I didn't really care, but it was very odd for them to keep coming back as we are eating. My review must sound so negative, but I still gave them 4-Stars, because I still really like the Burgers, Fries and Shakes. In my lifetime I have been to Steak n Shakes over 20 times and I loved it every time! The service here isn't up to par, but I'll still be back the next time i'm in Vegas! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Monta is definitely one of the better ramen shops in Las Vegas. Its in the same strip mall as Raku on Decatur/ Spring Mtn. Monta reminds us of Japan's ramen shops...its all about order your food, eat your food, and get out, so the next group can eat. It's not a posh restaurant, minimal tables/ seats. The restaurant holds at most 30 people (5 tables of 4 seats and about 10 seats on the counter), so if you go with a large party, just sit wherever you can and when you can or you might be waiting for awhile. The menu is simple. Miso, Tonkatsu, or Shoyu ramen. My favorite is...all of them. Huge stock pots in the back have been boiling bones and veg for hours to create the backbone of their heavenly broth. I seem to be on a tonkatsu ramen kick lately with its hearty broth... you could add some thickener to the broth and you would have a damn good gravy. They give you a good amount of ramen, a few slices of tender charsiu, bamboo, takenoko, green onions, half boiled egg, and kikurage. Its a solid meal for a cheap price, $7-8 and you can add other extras for a small price. Another favorite is their pork belly bowl. Its cheap and filling...not to mention very tasty. You get the thinly sliced pork served over rice in a small bowl garnished with beni shoga. Its tasty, fatty, and better when you get eat a little beni shoga (red pickled ginger) with it.. We always get a small bowl and share it. Their gyoza is good as is the kim chee fried rice. We need to try more of the items on their menu but we are creatures of habit and sometimes its hard to stray away from the dishes that Monta is known for. Its easy to over order food at Monta. Because the ramen bowls are big...resist ordering other dishes unless you have a big party and you want to share. Monta is great on a hot day and better on a cold day!! Arooha!!!!! ",0,0,0,1,0

 i was very happy to know that a smoked meat restaurant was opening near by waterloo. I got the 3 meat dinner as I wanted to try most of the meats. The meats were good but the sauce were a little too sweet and not smokey enough. It also made me feel a little sick to the stomach. There beans are good but again, the sauce made me feel a little sick. Would avoid this place and rather go to hog tails which has real authentic smoked meat and sauces. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Theme of the night: SLOOOOOOW The night started out promising: the hostess was notably attentive and friendly. Jessica, the bartender was solid and knowledgeable. But it was downhill from there. Our waiter introduced himself and his partner. Friendly enough guy. He took our drink order but then disappeared for 15 minutes. As the drinks were finally delivered the jokes started about ordering round 2 right then so that we'd have them by the time we drank these. Little did he know how true that would ring. After 30 minutes we had to call the waiter back over to take our order. THIRTY minutes. Our food came 45 minutes later. Yes, we received our entrees almost 90 minutes after we sat down. This wasn't a 5 star restaurant where that might be ok, people. To our waiter's credit, he did keep us somewhat updated, letting us know the kitchen was running slow/behind and took an entree off the bill. But he wasn't too attentive otherwise - keep us filled on drinks at least, por favor? Notice I haven't said anything about the food. It was ok - not bad but nothing memorable. But mostly since the experience had been ruined by the time the food finally came, it wouldn't really have mattered how good the food was. The 3am meal at Chicago Brewing Company was more memorable and enjoyable than this, if that tells you anything. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I walked in and thought they forgot to put the lid on a blender full of smurfs... BLUE... EVERYWHERE..... After I got past the atrocious decor, I ordered Wings mild, a appletini, kobe Burger and Sweet potato fries. The wings - they only had mild and hot when it came to ""buffalo"" flavors. I ordered mild, but preferred a little more kick. They were really good and juicy. The martini - ick ick ick too much crown royal.... wouldn't think I would complain about too much alcohol in my drink. I told the waitress and she didn't do anything. didn't offer to replace it or take it off my bill. The Kobe burger - hmmmm I ordered medium rare and it came out ""gray."" It tasted ok, but something just wasn't right with the meat. and I was disappointed that it was over cooked. The sweet potato fries- excellent, but you get a very small amount as a side to you burger. I would possibly go back and try a different burger. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Walking into this small restaurant, i could image I was in a nice part of Mexico City. Showing up with my customary crew of three little boys, you can imagine some people would be annoyed, but our hostess greeted us kindly and found us the space to sit down. They didn't mind at all that we had to park the stroller at the small bar. The boys were hungry monsters and we got baskets of chips right away. I found several lovely non spicy salsas for the boys, including a pecan salsa, cilantro salsa, and strawberry salsa. We ordered a mole taco, shark taco, and pibil taco with a side of rice and beans to share among us. It was plenty for two adults, two little ones and a very picky 8 yr old who just ate chips. Each taco was awesome.each was Realy unique in flavors. The beans and rice were both boring and bland. All salsas were delicious. It almost didnt m atter what we ate because it was all so delish. The decor was very appealing, although the walls were pretty dirty. The service was good, the music good and rather loud, which helped to drown out the baby pulverizing chips with his fists. This is not wat I would categorize as a good place to take kids, but even so, they were tolerated, and I am just not going to miss trying a place like this because I have my kids with me. The only drawback for me was that this is a SMALL place, and it was hot and airless inside. I don't know if the air conditioning was broken, but just a room fan would have helped a lot. We were sweating by the end of the meal, and not from the pico de gallo. I hope they get that worked out before summer melts the asphalt. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The atmosphere is very Romantic, they have a fully staffed sushi bar. The menu is totally for sushi lovers! The quality of the fish was what surprised me- but when you are paying top dollar for it, I suppose that is what makes the fish even more higher quality. We ate in the teppanyaki room- and had momos! To drink- The chef was very sociable but there was no real show like at Hamada or Others I've been too- but they told us after the fact that you could ask for more entertainment.. Aww... That would be a tip if ur bringing a toddler along! The food was yummy and tastey!

 I grew up in Michigan and one of my favorite Mongolian stir fry places anywhere was within driving distance. Unfortunately, they are not in Phoenix. And since moving here I've been looking for another place to get my fix. Genghis Grill is the best I've found yet in the valley. Not quite a perfect replacement but I certainly think it is pretty good. Choosing your starch was a nice touch. Not everyone feels like rice. I feel like some of the sauces are pretty bland but it does give you the ability to experiment. Also there are options on the menu for kids that may not be into stir fry. The only complication we had for service is that we both went to build our plates. While gone, our table was bussed. Having some sort of card that says someone is at this table may deal with that possible confusion. Also if you decide you want more than 1 bowl, having to wait for wait staff can be frustrating. I understand that it makes it easier to figure out who got 1 bowl vs all you can eat. But when the place is busy, you may be there a while if you want seconds or (somehow) thirds. ",0,0,1,0,0

 A little disappointing overall. We tried to book a reservation on the weekend, but this place is full. On a weekday evening was much easier. So it must be good. The waiter was really nice, but maybe trying too hard. There's waiters who you can tell are actually funny and having a good time, and others who sound like their first night on stage at a comedy club - complete bomb. anyways, we ordered the new york steak, salmon, and veal. everything was drenched in olive oil. i'm sure it was a high quality evoo, but everything pretty much tasted the same - olive oil with tomatoes and capers. the new york steak was by far the best dish. A good cut of beef. veal was okay, and the salmon with crispy skin would have been good had it not been of the overly sour tomato sauce and overabundance of capers (or whatever those were). Maybe we just ordered the wrong items, but we not not impressed with Rao's at all in terms of food. Being in Vegas and at Caesars, we knew what the price tag was going to be. So ""value"" didn't even figure into the 2 star rating. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Misty rain this a.m. in Old Town and thus I was in search of warm comfort food but should I go for full Scottish breakfast that sounded either one step above or below Denny's in U.S. or little place down the street; since the former is a bar whose server is not to be found, to Hula I went. I ask the server at 9:30 a.m. if it was too early to get soup and she says, ""It's never too early for soup!"" My kind of place. I ordered a chicken corn chowder which seems to have pureed potatoes as part of the soup base and comes with great thick slices of crusty grain bread and butter. Yummy and just the thing to warm up with. Later in the day, I returned for a large Orange & mango smoothies w/ energy boost. This too was good. The business has a great vibe with locals, international visitors speaking multiple languages, friendly staff, good eats, and wifi. This was another place I was lucky to stumble upon that I remembered reading about in Yelper Jenny L's reviews. Well worth checking out. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Now that I've seen what a club SHOULD look like (the new Mountainside Pavillions Club), I'm going to give this club only 3/5. We've been coming here for years, the renovation a year ago was needed, but they charged everyone $25 to pay for it. Pluses-front desk staff great, personal trainers are wonderful and always working us hard, lots of group classes. Negatives-cardio equipment at times is packed and seems to break down frequently (TVs, iPod jacks, rock, look dingy), the bathrooms were not renovated (men's showers/tile work need replacing, would be nice to be brought up to standards of Pavillions!)), the exercise equipment in big group room is not cleaned/repaired and they run out of regularly (big balls, rubber tubbing, rubberized hand weights are coming apart). Yoga room needs more floor space (still!) so is there some way to put in shoulder high shelves for the mats/blankets/bricks and also other shelves for people's shoes/purses to give us more floor sq ft? This was done in big fitness room for big balls/etc. Not safe when we are packed on like sardines. New Pavillions spin bikes are wonderful, we were suppose to get new bikes, but they delivered the refurbs. Old ones suck. Please someone from Corporate tell me that not every new $ went to open the two new clubs?! I'll be calling to find out what gives. We feel like a second class gym ;( ",0,0,1,0,0

 Walking distance from Circus Circus, open 24/7, and awesome food in portions that can satisfy your fattest friends. We found Peppermill by asking one of the security guards in the Circus Circus casino where we can eat at 1:30 in the morning, and he recommended this place. I halfway expected to see strippers inside, sort of like the breakfast/brunch bars in Portland. (the building is lit with blue neon) Instead, we got a really cool restaurant where the servers were friendly, and moderately dressed, by Vegas standards at least. We were seated promptly, and within five minutes, our food orders were taken, our bar orders were fulfilled by a different waitress/bar girl, and our sodas and waters were refilled. I swear, I think we were helped by at least six different people, and usually at this time of night, most places are running on skeleton crews. I ordered the ribs, which were amazing, and my friends got the alfredo, corned beef meal and steak, all of which looked flippin delicious. And the level of service was FANTASTIC, especially when you consider what we spent, and the time of night. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Decided to spend the afternoon at B&N since my boyfriend was looking for a new read.. Sunday, so while I expected a fair amount of family's and the noise that comes with them, I was pleasantly surprised that even the children passing through were well behaved and virtually unnoticeable from behind my book. The disruption was instead caused by employees. I realize this isn't a library, but customers camping out and reading quietly is the norm at any B&N. 2 lady employees were complaining loudly; one was a teacher, maybe the other was as well? The one complaining loudly was young and clearly unhappy with her students. From there I heard all about how they didn't listen to her instruction on an assignment and her subsequent ""punishment quiz"" she gave them afterwards. This conversation made me sad. I couldn't help but listen as they were standing literally right in front of me and they were by no means hiding their remarks. Clearly this woman isn't connecting with her students and instead of taking a different approach she went with punishment. No wonder her students didn't listen to her, she seems to hate her job... My boyfriend had left his book in the chair next to me... I saw it when he did it and knew he was doing it wrong; he'd left the book face down and open (the way you shouldn't leave a book). I didn't think much of it knowing that he would be purchasing it, however the other employee did. She clearly didn't realize we were together and when she noticed the book she grabbed it and exclaimed how much she hates it when people do that. I explained that he was coming back and the he would be purchasing this book to which she shoved a magazine subscription card in his place and explained they can't sell the books after they've been bent like that. Totally understand her point. 100%. She just seemed so unapologetic after I told her the situation and caught her exploding unnecessarily. I guess the point of my review is more about professionalism on the job... Happy with the store as a whole, disappointed in the employees. Makes me not want to ask for help in the future...

 Every Halloween season, it is a tradition to go to as many haunted houses as I can. When I heard about House of screams and wicked dreams, I was surprised by the long name. House of screams is definitely just enough for a name. I then heard the news of the production team of Jack and Jill's joining the House of screams team. I was genuinely excited because Jack and Jill's was my favorite house last year! Last weekend I finally got the chance to go to house of screams, but I was highly disappointed. The production was actually pretty good, but It wasn't scary. The animatronics were not working, they would go off late after you passed them up. Some of the actors literally said the word, ""Grrrrrr."" The rooms were too spaced out, and they had many opportunities to scare us but didn't take them. There were a few actors that were very good. One that I point to in particular was a girl with long black hair. I was genuinely creeped out. This has the makings of being a great haunted house. But right now, it still needs tons of work and love. Things they need to fix: Animatronics Statues that do nothing Work on timing with actors More detail Smaller spaces Get rid of clowns, or do something different with them. Things that are great: A few of the actors The story, although it needs a little work Good concepts Some production This could be a great haunted house! ",0,0,1,0,0

 The good thing about writing a review is that it may take a few days before you complete it. Wings Over Pittsburgh has totally benefited from this. If I would have wrote a review after my first experience with this establishment it would be less stars and bitter words. I completely love the wrap they have available here. It is a meal unto itself. Nothing really special about it, plain flour tortilla, lettuce, tomato and pieces of boneless wings with your choice of sauce or dry rub. I have tried several different sauces and one dry rub. For the wrap it is best to choose a sauce, if you get a dry rub, you will need something to dip it in, or hope that the juices from the tomatoes and lettuce will make it tasty. You can add crinkle cut fries for $1 or seasoned waffle fries for $1.50. As I said before, the wrap itself is more than enough for a meal. When I get the fries with it I always feel like I'm stupid for doing so. I can never finish both and I hate to waste it. My friends always order the ribs from here and are never disappointed. If I was a rib man I would be too. They look mighty good.

 I came here for dinner tonight, which was my second visit, the first being a few months ago for lunch. Thai Hut is pretty good. I am making a tiny comparison to Thai Elephant based on price and location, but I like different things about both places. I like the quick service at Thai Hut, even at lunch when it gets busy. The first time, I had the Pad Cee Ew (and completely butchered that spelling, but they don't have an online menu! I tried to find the proper spelling.) It was ok, but a little bland. My friend had the drunken noodles and they were awesome. Tonight I had the Yellow Curry Chicken and it was very good. Also the Thai Iced Teas were decent.

 If you're looking for a place to eat fish on the west side, I'd definitely recommend McGrath's. I've eaten here several times, most recently last week. My biggest pet peeve about most fish served in restaurants is that it's overcooked, but McGraths's fish is always moist and fresh tasting. I'm counting calories, and they offered the veggies and potatoes ""naked"", without any sauce, but still very good. The wine selection isn't very extensive, but I'd say that was my only complaint. Just remember this is the desert, and keep the expectations realistic. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I don't write very many reviews but after three days of thinking about it, I had to write something about our experience. First off I tried to convince my partner to go to HTC because it was much more conveniently located for us, but she insisted because she had her nose pierced at Halo and had an excellent experience. So off to Halo we went. Now keep in mind we knew very little about ear gauging so we definitely needed some information about it. We were met by a woman with very short white hair (adorable hair btw) and a mechanic shirt that had the name ""Vincent"". Unfortunately she was extremely rude and acted like any question we had was just plain ridiculous of us to ask. To say that it was a humiliating experience, would actually be an understatement. I wanted to walk out but my partner really wanted to go to the piercer at this location. So we continued to endure the rudeness and impatience from ""Vincent"".

 I remember going to my first Wendy's, what, a couple of decades ago? I remember thinking the hamburger tasted just like my mom's. Flash forward to last week, and granted I haven't been to a Wendy's in a very long time... but my order of fast food, was very disappointing. The fries weren't ""like they use to be"", my sandwich tasted like McDonalds. This Wendy's, anyway, is a true disappointment , to me, the food is not worth it, the experience is not worth it, the taste and appearance, ""not like it use to be"" won't be back... probably impacts my opinion of the entire franchise now...

 If your going to RA, I would recommend choosing another location. I frequently visit the Awahtukee spot, which is really great, and this chain let me down. Not only did the restaurant seem pretty worn, the food was awful. The shrimp dynamite roll was a greasy, soggy mess of mostly heavy cream sauce with a few scallops over rice pieces - disgusting. When the waitress asked how the dish was and I expressed my disappointment, you would think you would get an offer to send it back or pick something else. Nope....just a blank look of confusion (but she was really nice). I had then ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll, which I have had many times at other locations, but something was not quite right at this place. The pieces were a lot smaller and not evenly tempura battered. I'm in no way a sushi snob, but I was pretty upset that I spent a good amount of dough for a crappy meal. On the plus side, the waitress treated my son with complimentary gelato. If I ever decide to visit RA again, it won't be here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We visited the Aria back in 2012 and wanted a re visit, we spend the first part of our stay in Vegas at the Cosmopolitan next door but due to the overwhelming amount of Hotels in Las Vegas we decided that we wanted to spend it in two hotels so the Aria was our second choice. We arrived around 6pm and there was no queue at the Reception so we was checked in right away, we had also received a complimentary upgrade to a Strip/City View, i had asked for a high floor and the highest they could put us was the 22nd, the hotel did not seem full so I'm not sure why they couldnt have put us on a higher floor but the 22nd was great!! We arrived into our room and the music on the TV came on automatically, and the blackout curtains begin to open to show you the view, a really cool idea! I also loved the remote controlled device where you could change the lighting,the TV,the automatic curtains and other parts of the room, the bed was also very comfortable, parts of the room was looking a bit dated from the bedside cabinets and wardrobes, but apart from that a really nice room with a great view of the Aria and parts of the Las Vegas Strip. What i love about this Hotel though is the chilled out vibe,everywhere seems really relaxed including all of the employees who work at the Aria. The pool area is also really nice and one of the main reasons why we came back, we love the pool areas alot and loved the chilled out music begging played from the speakers, all the pool attendants was really friendly and couldnt do enough to help, though drink prices are really expensive around the pool, we paid $17 for two beers which was a bit crazy but this can be expected from the Pool bars in Vegas. We had a superb stay in the Aria and we look forward to staying there again in the near future. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Yes, their frozen hot chocolate is very good just like everyone else says. I think this is what usually draws most folks into this place. However, be prepared to wait for a very long time to be seated. I had one of their omelettes which was pretty good, definitely good size portions for their food. Overall though, it's probably not worth what it costs to actually eat a meal here. It's certainly a little on the pricey side. I'd say this is probably a good place to go for dessert, but with so many good buffets and other good food places in Vegas, I'd probably pass on this one next time unless I was going for another frozen hot chocolate. I believe they do have an area near the entrance where you can order things to go, this might be a better option for you if you've got a lot planned for the day in vegas and don't want to wait in line forever.

 I've heard so many good things about Joyride that I was super excited when the opportunity came up to try it out. I had very high expectations. I guess it goes to show, that time & time again, when expectations are high, they are hardly ever met. My comments about the service are very positive .. No complaints at all. When we walked into the restaurant, there were quite a few tables open & the hostess let us pick where we sat. The establishment isn't that large, but it was kind nonetheless for her to offer us the option. In general, we noticed they are really quick about bringing chips & salsa to the table as they do it as soon as all patrons are seated. They are good at keeping water glasses filled, making sure any questions are answered about the menu, orders are put in right away, etc. My comments about the food are not so positive. I opted to get three tacos (comes with a free side when you get 3) - the shrimp taco, the crispy fish taco, & the chicken tinga taco (the second two per recommendation of our waitress). None of them blew me away .. Nor were they even that good to mention to someone. The chicken tinga was just spicy, which I am ok with, but lacked flavor. The shrimp was the same way. I would say of the three, the crispy fish was the best, but again, nothing to rave about, & almost too heavy with the added stuff on top. I got the black beans as my side ... My mistake. They just tasted like beans out of a can topped with a little bit of cheese. No seasoning. I didn't understand nor enjoy them. My dining-mate got the veggie burrito & it was really good. For how much he paid, he enjoyed it & more. Lastly, it's to be noted that there are a ton of flies in the restaurant. It was not only annoying, but also felt un-sanitary. I almost wanted to leave before we even ordered, but decided to stick around. I guess I should've gone with my original gut instinct! ",0,1,0,0,0

 So what more can I say about Swish as I go way back to when the previous location on Sahara and Buffalo was the place to go for Shabu Shabu and Sukiyaki. My brother and I had the great opportunity to go to the new Chinatown location last weekend and my hats off to Phil because the food is even better now. The Crispy Garlic Chicken and Sassy Calamari appetizers were a delicious way to start and the Kobe Chuck in both ways of cooking was the best meal we had bar none during our stay in Sin City. You can't argue the bang for the prices and if you enjoy spicy, go with the Spicy Salmon Salad... I could eat that all day! We went during lunch hours and our waitress Hazuki did a great job taking care of us. Great food, great service.. and now its closer to the Strip. Definitely go check it out folks.. you won't regret it=) ",0,0,0,0,1

 I come here to satisfy my pho cravings since it's convenient. The broth is sometimes rich and sometimes dull. Service is alright (depending on who's working). It's pretty pricey and the soup bowl is kind of small compared to other places. One thing I really love from here are their vietnamese sandwiches. I prefer the pork because it is more tasty than the beef and it is very affordable around $3.50 a sandwich. Oh and they won't accept your card if you don't meet the minimum requirement which may be around 10 or 15 dollars so bring cash if you don't plan on spending that much. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I went here with my family and had a wonderful time. It was a little under a two hour drive from Phoenix, but well worth the trip. It is literally an orchard in the middle of the desert - pretty amazing if you ask me! The people here are really nice and helpful. We arrived at 2:30 (they close at 3) and after we picked out our wheelbarrow I confirmed that we had 20 minutes to pick our apples and the man replied, ""Ma'am, this is the country. We close when you are done picking apples. Take your time."" So...we did take our time...an hour and a half...and had fun. You can pick pears, golden delicous, red delicious, braeburn and fuji apples for $1/lb and they are all organic! They also have some animals - pigs, cows, horses - which my kids enjoyed seeing. Overall, it was a fun family outing and I would definitely do it again :) ",0,0,0,0,1

 This was my first, and possibly last visit to Fuel. The first thing I noticed was the overwhelming smell of bleach/chlorine/Lysol. For a place famous as a late night eat, it was extremely disappointing to be hit with such a disgusting and appetite-killing odor. Where's the smell of freshly fried fries, beautifully cooked burgers, or cheesy baked pizzas? Or even a smell of beer? Being a first timer, the menu was hard to figure out; I had to reference the normal menu for descriptions (which isn't effecting the star rating). But overall the food was okay for the $5 late night menu--I ordered a sierra grilled chicken salad. The chicken was slightly dry but the apple smoked bacon was really good. The rest of my party ordered the pizzas and burgers. Both friends who ordered the Havana burger noted that it tasted like tuna--the description said it was pulled pork, ham, and beef. I still left with a taste of Lysol. ",0,0,1,0,0

 To all the people saying they've seen better aquariums in other places...This is Vegas and we are in the middle of the desert. We are not typically known for exhibits that appeal to our educational side. I think for Vegas, this aquarium is fantastic. The habitats are well designed and so beautiful. They have taken great care in creating them to be both effective for the marine life and stunning for us spectators - that much is obvious. I have been to a lot of aquariums and can't say that I've seen better. I think for this being on the smaller side of aquariums, they have a nice spectrum of marine life and reptiles. The jellyfish and starfish exhibits are my favorite; they are so visually stunning. And you absolutely cannot beat the shark exhibit, which is built to look like a sunken ship, with you standing on the inside. To all those people bitching about the size and prize, go to the Golden Nugget to see the free Shark Tank instead. Maybe then, you'll appreciate this gem of Vegas. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Am I taking crazy pills???!!!!! Four stars???? Really???? I think there needs to be some sort of quiz before being allowed to write reviews...... It could be as simple as: How many fingers am I holding up? Who was the first president of the United States? Or, have you ever eaten Mexican food before? So based on its proximity to my home and the four star reviews from yelpers, we gave it a go. Was it completely terrible? No. But come on guys, call it what it is. This place is no better than an El Torito. Frankly, you are way better off to go to Baja Fresh, take it home, make your own margarita and save 50 bucks... I had the carne asada fundido. Basically its like an under-fried chimi with steak and sauteed peppers and onions inside and sour cream on top. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't shitty, but there just isn't anything to sing about. Utterly average... Traveling for work a lot, I get to eat in a lot of great cities. The only reason I mention that is that in many cities, if you open an ""ok"" restaurant, it is closed inside a year. You just can't survive if you are this average. I have had better mexican food in Seattle for god's sake....SEATTLE!!!!!!! There are more mexican americans in this town that the entire population of Washington State....

 I recently attended a conference at Caesars Palace, and our company held a cocktail reception in one of their Presidential Suites, and found the suite more than lacking! Not only did we have to wait until 4pm to check in, but when we finally got into the suite, the real issues began. It was dirty (carpet had really filthy areas, the door jam outside looked like someone had spilled beer on it, and several yellow upholstered chairs were so dirty I had to move them out and hide them in a closet); the furniture was chipped, tablecloths had holes in them When I requested housekeeping to help clean up some of the filth on the door and in the service area, they showed up 2 hours later. By that time I had already cleaned the grime away. (Note that all of the staff that came by to help were very nice and really tried to fix the issues -- such as get the air conditioner to work, and get the front double door to closes!) It also came with no standard-stocked items. When I requested a coffee pot to replace the K-cup maker, they told me I had to ""rent"" one for $40; to get a corkscrew required calling room service and paying for them to deliver one, etc, etc. etc. The final ding was that for over $800/night, our not-so-lovely view was of the back of the Caesar's sign. If you are looking for a high-quality suite, don't come to Caesars! ",0,1,0,0,0

 In fairness to Islands, I'm not a burger fanatic. I didn't even want a burger necessarily, but since Islands was the closest thing to a vacation I might see this year, and they are known for their fine burgers, this is where we ended up. We started with chips and salsa. ""Started with.."" There lies my problem. Why do I always have to ""start with"" something. Why not ""start with"" my entree like a normal person. I digress, I'm having a fat day. The chips were a little over browned, but it's just a chip right? The guacamole was actually pretty good, however. I went with the Big Wave cheeseburger. I love that the bun was toasted, but it was on the greasy side. Other than that, no complaints, was actually quite a good burger. The fries (thick cut-skin on) were not very good, however. They were hot, but didn't seem fresh. We did have great service though. Islands is quite a distance from me, so I think I would save the gas money and fly to Hawaii instead. Funny how that was almost true not too long ago. But if you're at Desert Ridge, it's worth the stop. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Visited late August for dinner party of 3. This place is classy with higher-end clientele and very attentive staff. The seafood at Joe's is ABSOLUTELY delicious. I ordered a grilled seafood platter which is was part of a special menu for restaurant week. I really hope they do start offering this on their regular menu because if was one of freshest and tastiest seafood platters I have had in Las Vegas. I would have taken a picture of it for you all, but I got completely distracted by the delicious aromas emanating from my platter and before you know it, it was all gone!!! Our server Bill was very nice, extra attentive to all our need and a class act. Overall Joe's is a classy restaurant with a cool vibe and most importantly, with top quality seafood. We will definitely be back to try some of their other items on the menu. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Came here a couple weeks ago and enjoyed the experience immensely...except for the wait, of course. We didn't have a reservation, so hung out at the bar and had drinks for about 45 minutes. We weren't in a hurry so it was fine, but if you want to sit immediately, make reservations...and make them well in advance. On to the food (which - let's be real - is what we all care about). We ordered: - Cheese & Charcuterie Plate: We went with the Fennel Salami, VSOP Gouda and the Mobay, all of which were yummy (the Fennel cheese is very Fennel-y so if you don't like Fennel...you've been warned). I will say that I felt their meats/cheeses were outrageously expensive (I compare them to what I can get at Good Food on Montford, which are similarly delicious and you get twice the goods for slightly more than what B&G's charging). I know, I know, quality over quantity...I just don't think I'm enough of a meat/cheese connoisseur to think what they're charging was worth it. That said, we still enjoyed them. - The B&G Burger (their signature burger grind): I went pretty mainstream with my entr \ u00e9e choice, and was not disappointed...from the moment they sat that burger in front of me with its little ""B&G"" branded bun, I was a happy camper. Burger was cooked perfectly, bun was great, fires were great...it was great. Did I mention it was great? - Sides of Pan Fried Corn, Brussels Sprouts, Mac & 3 Cheese: In my opinion, these were easily stars of the show. These aren't particularly inventive or crazy sides, you see them (in various forms) on lots of menus...but what set them apart was the execution. They were all just perfection. My mouth is watering just thinking about how great each of them were...makes me desperately want to try to the rest of the sides. Could I get a meal of just sides? I kid, I kid...sort of... I can't exactly remember what my boyfriend ordered...I think I was too enamored with my food to care. A steak or something that I'm sure was amazing. Well done, B&G...well done. Slash the prices on your meats and cheeses, but otherwise, keep up the good work. P.S. they have corkage ($15 fee, which in my book isn't horrible - but then I'm from L.A. so take it with a grain of salt). ",0,0,0,1,0

 Took my parents here since it was conveniently located in the MGM casino floor. Had the lettuce wraps which were tasty but had more carrots and nuts than chicken. Portion was a decent size. We shared the chicken lo mien and the Mongolian beef. The lo mien was really good. The Mongolian beef needed more seasoning. All and all it meet our expectations. The service could have been better. Spent most of my time trying to flag a waitress to get our bill. Also our waitress forgot to tell us she was leaving. She never came back after serving our food.

 So I had to see what all the hype was about.....The front of the house merchandising is interesting for sure. So I went with a classic cheeseburger, fries and a coke.

 We went here for the lunch time buffet. The buffet tables are set up in the back of the dining area in such a way that the line queues up pretty quickly yet moves very slowly.

The staff demeanor is about the same as any of the other Indian restaurants around Madison, not particularly friendly, but not downright rude either. I like the decor, dark red, black, and gold colors, and lots of wine bottles up behind the register.

 It is hard to say anything that has not already been said by the master twin creeks-ers Anthony M. the Duke, Jieun L., Nelson Q., Elnino F. and all of the other brilliant happy hour-ers. I finally made it here with Eric R. to test out the 75% off happy hour, when we came by after our failed event that conflicted with the elite event at Silverton. I really wanted to try the golden cucumber mint cocktail, but our waitress/bartender suggested the toasted almond since it is my favorite drink bartenders never seem to know how to make. Martini style here, the $10 drink became $2.50 with the wave of a time wand and I ended up with a frothy delicious amaretto-kahlua-cream combo that rivaled a very tasty drink I had many times during happy hour in our Cambodia hotel on the honeymoon (that one had Baileys, which sometimes makes its way into toasted almonds). I made Eric R. order the oatmeal cookie martini because his favorite ice cream is Ben n Jerry's oatmeal cookie crunch which I hunted down at many stores until I found it. We got the calamari (which was $2!) - all to myself bc the boy doesn't eat anything fried, the meatballs (all beef, very tasty), and the smoked salmon toasts. Eric decided he wanted a salad so he got the chopped with romaine instead of iceberg, and the waitress was cool sending it back bc it was doused in dressing and he wanted it on the side. The salad was not on happy hour, so it doubled the cost of our meal, but it was our third $18 meal this week for the 2 of us so no complaints here. The best part was running into Anthony M., Jieun L., and Sun M. on our way out...and then Angela H. and Jade W. and Andy T.! I will definitely return for the cocktails (I still want to try the cucumber mint one) and all of those snazzy martinis, but I may just stick to toasted almonds. ",0,0,0,1,0

 THE ABSOLUTE BEST BUFFET IN LAS VEGAS, HANDS DOWN!!! Come for brunch (make sure you get there at least by 1 p.m., because they close at 2 p.m.). It's around $25, which surprisingly is cheaper than most Vegas buffets of much lower quality. The selection of food is ridiculous, everything from breakfast to short ribs to sushi to fried chicken, just everything. And their desserts are unbelievable! One of my favorites that I've seen there a couple times is a Chocolate Molten Cake. They also have a section with about 15 different Gelatos to choose from, including a Nutella flavor. Besides the food, another reason why Wicked Spoon is the best is because the majority of the food is in individual serving dishes. It's not like most buffets where you have to scoop up what you want out of a huge serving platter, which is disgusting because you have so many people coming into contact with what you're about to eat. I can't say enough great things about Wicked Spoon, a MUST when in Vegas. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I drank the biking kool-aid this summer and bought my first USA made canondale from Budget's Used shop on Regent Street and have since picked up two more USA made Cannondales. One of them was a 2007 bike with a Lefty shock on it that wasn't working correctly so I dropped it off at this new shop. I didn't realize just how new they were, but I'm glad I found them! Their building is GORGEOUS...being in the architecture industry myself, they restored this building beautifully which creates such a unique atmosphere in the shop. It's neat to see such historic architecture housing some of the latest beautifully engineered bikes! Their mechanical shop staff was helpful and very willing to educate me as I'd never owned a bike with this type of suspension...I love to be able to walk out knowing more than I did when I went in. Overall I I had the bike tuned (which included straightening my rear wheel and rear disk brake), hydraulic brake bled, and new front brake pads put on for a reasonable $120!

 Let us all bow our heads as a star has died for this review. Yes, I unfortunately have to retract a star after last night's terrible service at Fat Choy. The food was good, but the service was just terrible. We sat down at a booth where there were four other tables and a 6 top taken. For this place with one cook in the back, it must have been very overwhelming, because our food took 42 minutes to get to us. That being said, our table remained piled with dishes, drinks were never refilled, and after a TWO HOUR DINNER at Fat Choy, most of that time in waiting, I waived the white flag and approached the counter to pay for my bill while we waited for our last order of bao to come out. The bao this evening was slightly different, heavier on the pickled greens, folded in cold bao instead of steamed bun, fingerprints of sauce on the buns from the cook, and it lacked the crushed peanuts on top. Our potstickers were more greasy than our first two times at Fat Choy, and those took an additional 30 minutes because the server failed to write our order down properly the first time. With that being said, we will seek out another bao place in town. Service is everything to me, and after last night, this place is not worth returning to if the service and quality of food can be that inconsistent. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Overrated. I had better, I don't get what's the hype all about. Service was rude. The chefs and waitresses acted like they hated their job and also hated everyone. At least at work, act the part. I left disappointed and kind of upset. Food was mediocre. Nothing special. Moving on. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Decent enough movie theater if you decide to go during the day, but forget about it if you go at night and to see the new release of a popular movie. My wife and I went to see Paranormal Activity 3 last night. Unfortunately, we only got to hear about 1/3 of the movie for the constant running commentary and unnecessary screaming. When I complained to the management that they needed to get the audience under control, the response I received from a Charlotte police officer was ""what do you want me to do, there's 250 of them in there"". When I spoke to the manager, her response was, ""what do you expect on opening night of a horror movie; there's nothing I can do to stop it"". Furthermore, the officer then stated, ""This is why we recommend that normal adults who actually want to see the movie don't come out on opening weekend."" When another member of the audience asked for a refund for the same reason, the theater manager stated, ""We don't give refunds. If the audience was being disruptive, you could have come and told us."" This was AFTER she said there was nothing they could, or would, do about it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I came here a few years ago. Pho tasted bland. Just came back recently because a bunch of people were going... still tasted the same bland flavor. Seems their broth just has no flavor kick to it. It's not terrible but there are better pho places out there in Tempe. There's Pho Cao (good) and Khai Hoan (very good). Try those places in Tempe. Better pho places are even better in Mesa.

 I think I should start with the positive. The car we rented was great. It was clean, new and got great mpg. Now the negative. Cost of car rental about $11.00. We had forgotten our GPS. Cost of GPS rental $13.00. Think about it. 25k car for $11. $99.00 GPS for $13.00. Since we had no idea where we were we took the GPS drove to a pawn shop purchased one for $35 and returned the GPS to Dollar Rental. But while checking the car out the guy tried to sell us everything under the sun. The usual ridiculous extra insurance and played the fear game. You're in Las Vegas, bad things happen here. When we told him we would be purchasing a gps and returning theirs he told us that would be time consuming because maps would have to be downloaded and that would be terribly time consuming. I know that's a straight lie. We own 4 and they are ready to go out of the box. Back to the extra insurance. Most people's insurance will cover rentals. Many credit cards cover rentals with a few exceptions such as luxury vehicles and off road vehicles. Your auto insurance pays first and the credit cars picks up the the difference. Auto policies and credit cards vary but everyone should know exactly what their policies cover. It will take a 5 minutes phone call to verify. They wanted to charge another $24 daily to add me on as a driver. So my husband got stuck doing all the driving. Wtf, is this legal in NV? The car was great. The bs sales on the extras was awful. Do that many people fall for that crap? ",0,1,0,0,0

 Well done Gordon Ramsay! He never fails to impress me. I went to Burgr with my husband to check out the food and the service because I really like Gordon Ramsay's work ethic and his food. First of all the decor and everything was super cool and impressive. Very simple and easy to choose menu with a picture of Gordon on the back. The clothes/uniforms that the servers wearing were also cool. Dark denim jeans and button up shirts for the guys and full zipper short tight dresses for the girls. Very hip and young staff. I ordered the euro burger and my husband ordered one of their foot long hot dogs. 5-7 mins later our orders are in front of us and we were really impressed by the quick and friendly service. I ordered my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. We also ordered the sweet potato fries which comes with a light creamy sauce and powdered sugar. It was also pretty good. The only thing thing that amazed me was the manager actually came to our table and asked us about the food and how we were doing, is there anything that she can do for us. When you get a treatment like this at a restaurant even if you ordered some fries and burgers, you actually feel very appreciated for choosing them and being their customer. Young staff, great food, excellent service I give this restaurant 5 starts! Definitely try and go here. P.S; The restaurant is inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel on the strip. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Because my visit was before Labor Day the water park was closed and the park was not particularly crowded. I do think the rides should have wait times posted, though. My longest wait was thirty minutes for the Nighthawk, but if it had been busier I would have been frustrated not knowing the wait times. The Intimidator is no joke. I *LOVE* rollercoasters, but when this one stopped, I realized my legs were shaking and I wondered what I had just put myself through. Then I put myself through it again. And again. The staff who run the thrill rides were incredibly professional and safety-conscious. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. We did the Walk with the Dinosaurs and it was pretty disappointing. The attraction is very poorly maintained. The landscaping was haphazard and all the water elements were dry, in spite of having several inches of rain the prior week. Definitely skip paying the extra fee for this. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Meh is a perfect descriptive word for this place. Unfortunately, its the closest fro-yo place to my house so I've actually been here around 4-5 times in the past year. I usually just come for the Original tart flavor to satisfy my craving; but the flavors are typically limited and not appealing. I would recommend they bring back a good fruit flavor- strawberry was good and peace- pretty decent as well. Last time I went in though, the original tart had somehow blended with tart-cherry which was the 2nd flavor in the machine and came out pink= not cool. I got nutella flavor instead, which wasn't bad, but I've had better chocolate flavors elsewhere... Then... GASP! The mochi, my favorite topping in the world (which they only recently have available) was like rock-solid. Also not cool; it might be a good idea to switch the containers out or not-fill them as full so they get stale so quickly. Overall, I might give the place another chance since it's so close to my house but please bring back strawberry! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Great chill pub to hang out with friends at. There is outdoor seating and couches out there so you can hang out, lounge, drink and laugh with your friends. The service is a little slow, but since I was in no rush, it suited us fine. There are also pool tables in the back and there were a lot of TVs throughout the place to keep you up to speed on sports if that's what you are looking for. I'd go there again not only because they carry Kona Longboard Lager (since most places don't) but also because of the relaxed atmosphere. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I love Primanti's! It doesn't matter whether it's noon or 4am, which it was for this visit to the flagship location. What happens at 4am here? Not really much. Cops come in to get a sandwich. Some drunks are eating at the bar, but not as much action, as I thought there would be. Just good ole' sammiches topped with some of the most delicious fries you've ever tasted. Just add a touch of vinegar and you're golden. Moral of the story is, their sandwiches are delicious at any time of the day or night! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Marcella's has a very atypical ambiance for a Scottsdale restaurant, which makes it an experiential treat to visit. The interior has an old school look to it, which reminds me of Italian restaurants on the East coast and Midwest. The parlor and outdoor bar area the most interesting places to sit in the place to admire the old school cabinetry and flooring. As interesting of a place as Marcella's is, I've had relatively ""meh"" food experiences each time I've been there. I noticed that the menu had changed when I visited yesterday. Apparently it's now become more of a fine dining establishment. Rather than venture into having any of the new pasta dishes, I had the vegetarian pizza which was surprisingly the best thing I've eaten there so far. The flatbread pizza was topped with plenty of mushrooms, tomatoes and other veggies, and was garnished with an arugula salad that was tossed in a tart dressing. Although I don't envision myself become a regular there, I'll probably stick to the veggie pizza to avoid further disappointment. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Happy to say I had a great experience at Vanity Nails! I am very picky about my nails and they exceeded my expectations. Staring with the pedicure the technician did a fabulous job toe nails are nicely shaped and feet are so soft. I just did the basic and it was only $20. I have paid much more at other places and have received a lot less. Also they have a nice variety of polish selection. The massage chair was also amazing really worked the tension knots out of my shoulders and neck. For the nails I got a new set of pink and whites and they are the best I have had in along time. I removed my old set before coming in and had a sore spot on my thumb the technician was very careful with that area. As for the nails they are nicely shaped, thin, and down to the cuticle. And again the price amazed me at only $45. The salon is also clean and has a nice atmosphere all of the technicians seem friendly and professional. Glad to have found such a nice nail salon in Vegas.

 When your looking for speed, quality, and price, this place hits on all marks. Some of the best tacos i've ever had in my life. I like that you can try all sorts of different meats from head, tongue, leg, and even cheek meat. On my last visit I think that I ordered almost one of every style of taco. What was really outstanding was the grilled green onions and peppers you can get as a side, probably the best version out of any taqueria in Vegas. The corn tortillas are very good as well. Everything is very clean and the prices are right on point. Everything tasted fresh and well made, I liked it. This place also seems to be packed, and there is a good reason. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was excited to try this place since I had heard good things about Pink's and I was pretty hungry after a day spent at the pool. I ordered a bacon chili cheese dog and I would say it was just OK! The chili was alright and the hot dog was pretty long but just skinny :(. It didn't wow me since I have been to other places where they serve my fave hot dogs so I had high expectations to meet up to. The dog was pretty loaded though - had enough chili, cheese, bacon strips, onions, and tomatoes but the taste was just average. Difficult to eat without using a fork and knife since I couldn't fit my mouth around all the ""stuff"" loaded in the dog. Just wondering if the Pink specialties would be better??? The fries were average. Kinda pricey overall for around $10 for a hot dog and a soda. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I... don't get it. I don't get the high rating on this restaurant. Sorry, guys. When we arrived, the parking lot was packed, but once inside we were seated almost immediately out on the patio. Unfortunately, we were not seated with menus. Our server visited our table twice before correcting this error. One of our salsa bowls arrived at our table with caked on food bits. After ordering our food, we waited almost an hour for our entrees... which were sincerely lacking in yum. I ordered the Faja Pasta - so maybe it's partially my own fault for order a pasta dish at a Mexican restaurant - but it was not very good. The pasta was very doughy, and many of the noodles were clumped together. The bread it came with, while not awful, was partially soggy from sitting on the plate too long. Saving grace was the chicken I had with it. It was juicy and had a nice kick. One star for the chicken. Fiance ordered a seafood enchilada which he found lacking in seafood and smothered in too much cheese. We ate until we were full enough to call it a meal. As unsatisfying as it was. Second star is for our server, because even though he was a smidge on the slow side, he was trying, bless his heart. He refilled my soda before it was completely empty, so that's a plus for me. I don't think we'll be returning. ",0,1,0,0,0

The restaurant is very spacious and clean and allows the dimsum carts to roll by you without bumping into anything or anyone. The dishes are always hot, which is extremely important.

 I was a bit hesitant at trying out Cravings after reading some of these reviews. However, our stay in Las Vegas was this time with the Mirage, so we ended up going to Cravings after all. We went there for lunch and paid 18.50 per person, which is an ok price. Unless you're looking to go to McDonalds or another fast food chain restaurant, that's about the price you'll end up paying per person for a decent meal anywhere around here, so it wasn't too daunting. I ended up giving Cravings 3 stars, based on my findings below. First of all, service was excellent. I'd rate it 5 stars if I could separate service & food stars. Our drinks were always filled, in fact, most of the time we'd barely emptied half our glasses before the waitress/attendant came and topped off the drink. Also, our plates were promptly cleaned up once we were done with a course, and the waitresses/waiters & greeters were VERY friendly. So kudos to the staff @ Cravings, keep up the good work. Let's move on to what we're here for.... food! I think the easiest way to rate and comment on this would be station by station. Mexican/Latin Foods - very disappointing. In fact, my husband even asked if there truly was a Mexican chef there or if they'd hired a British chef to handle the Latin food. (No offense to British chefs out there that are good at all types of cuisines.... he was just playing off stereotypes, obviously.... Gordon Ramsay probably cooks better Mexican food than any Latin chef out there ;-)) ANYWAY, the plantains - huge disappointment. I love plantains, I was very excited to see them but the taste was off. The enchiladas were not very good either, and I didn't attempt the taco fixings but I'm assuming those were ok since theres not much to prepare in way of cooking those... BBQ - fairly tasty! :-) They redeem themselves some!! I had a wonderful veal brisket with a tangy BBQ sauce on the side. The sweet potato salad w/spicy mustard was also good. They had a cornbread ""pie"" which was awesome, very smooth, and their BBQ beans were great. I'm definitely a fan of the BBQ section of ""Cravings"". Carving Station - Two thumbs up!! I had the thickest, juciest slices of turkey on my plate and they were not cheap on the servings, I was a very happy camper while endulging in the delights of the carving station. Chinese - Meh. Middle of the road, not a big selection of good stuff, but enough to satisfy any craving for Asian foods. Nice eggrolls. Sushi - I'll have to rely on my husband for this review as I'm not a big fan of sushi. He said it was great, he complemented the Sushi chefs... the sushi were just the right size and they had a good variety. Salad bar - Awesome! Great selection of fresh cold cuts! Fishmonger/Raw bar - no comment, didn't visit those so I can't judge, however the selection was not very good and whatever they had there, didn't look too tempting.... Italian - Middle of the road, ok selection of pizzas. Dessert - Pretty tasty. Best Napoleon Cake I've tasted in a long time! Also their chocolate mousse was fantastic, with chunks of chocolate bites in there, and the bread pudding was also very good. Nice selection of sugar free desserts as well, and they tasted good... not ""sugar free"" All in all though, I must say you can find better buffets in Vegas for less... I probably won't be choosing Cravings in the future. ",0,0,1,0,0

 It was a mystery to me that on the Worldmark owner's site, that this Las Vegas property consistently was rated higher than the other two. On one hand, I cannot understand why. On the other, I can see why. I guess the determining factor would be your purpose in visiting Vegas as well as your length of stay. That is not necessarily a good thing. A bit older in appearance and details to the unit are on the cheaper side. For example, the kitchen sink is plastic. Who puts in a plastic kitchen sink? The backsplash was detached from the counter so water could dribble down to the back. The 27 inch tube television in the living room sits in a bulit in cabinet with a slide out stand. But the stand doesn't rotate enough so that you can view it from the sofa or the dining table. The rooms though are much bigger than your standard Worldmark unit and the Master has a walk-in closet. Overall the property is much smaller, so it is a bit quieter. But when I am on vacation, I am not too thrilled about staying in a place that reminds me of the cheap apartments I used to rent when I was in college because I had no money. It is much closer to the strip right off of Flamingo Ave so it's a straight shot to the center of all the action and they have a shuttle going to Harrah's every hour. It is a couple of blocks away from UNLV. There are many businesses nearby so it is just a quick drive to get anything. The best thing is that it is near Raising Cane which has the best chicken fingers you will find anywhere. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm writing my review as I'm spending my last night of 6 nights at this hotel. My favorite thing about this hotel is its location. It's about a block away from the nearest metro stop (Peel), although you probably don't need to take the subway to get to most attractions if you don't mind a bit of walking. It's about 5 blocks away from one of the main entrances into Parc du Mont Royal (at Rue Peel and Avenue des Pins Ouest), and it's a must visit on a nice day! Oh heck, that's not my only favorite thing about the hotel. I love their daily complimentary coffee and bottled water refills - two things I need daily, their super firm yet fluffy pillows, and their workstation with desk top outlet (so you don't have to crawl under to plug/unplug. The big shower head makes me want to take 4 showers a day. Standard room comes with a sizable shower stall, no bathtub, in case you're into that stuff... Some reviews on Tripadvisor complained about the wifi. Let me just affirm that I haven't had any wifi connectivity issues during my entire stay here. Wifi is consistent and relatively fast. It resets every 24hrs so you just need to reenter your room info to restart the cycle. The gym is on the 4th floor right by my room, which I never used. I took a peek and thought it was pretty small, but I really didn't have the need to run like a hamster on my vacay when I'm walking everywhere. The room service from the restaurant downstairs (L'Aromate) is prompt (but pricey as expected)! It took them 10-15min to deliver my food, and they were pretty tasty. My only gripe is the full size mirror. Mine has the fattening effect, or maybe I'm just in denial about my food consumption in Montreal. If that's the case, leave me alone.

 Whoa, I got a room for the Internet price of $37 dollars a night, but was I in for a surprise. The toilet quit working in the first room. Twice, I had to put my hand in the tank to adjust the flapper, because it was stuck. Additionally, the fluorescent light was flickering and about to go out, so I had to leave that light out. I got another room and behold the toilet does not work again. Good thing, I am pretty good at fixing things, so I adjust the toilet so that I works again. I also found out that the wire in the cable TV was broken, so I was able to rewire the cable for them. However, the housekeeper juggled the cable and I had to rewire the cable when I came back. The rugby players were drunk and noisy, so bring earplugs. After years of traveling, I always bring earplugs. On the up-side, the price was dirt cheap and you are next to the Fashion Mall, which must be the biggest shopping center in the Phoenix Scottsdale Area. I notice the Scottsdale PD checking license plates each morning. Next time, I will bring my tools to help them repair the facility.

 Was recommended to this place by my friends who are actually from India... I expected authenticity and wasn't let down in the food department. The place is dimly lit and nicely decorated to reflect its heritage... (which reminds me, I really must find chandeliers similar to the ones found in Khushi, they are very pretty!) The portions are small, which makes the prices appear slightly steep. The food (We had naan and lamb biryani) tastes pretty decent, but my friends didn't enjoy the service and the staff as they put on too much of a ""show"". I thought it was manageable and let that slide. All in all, if you have the right company and are craving for indian food, this place is pretty ok. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Now how did this slip by? been here over 20 times, not sure why/how i missed writing about it - i would suppose it's not exactly 'up there' & 'all that', nor really not bad either.

And it's not one of those patios facing a road - it actually has grass, birds, fountains.... {o, um, ok: alot of kids playing in the water ---- but the peals of laughter still better than traffic}. Their HH is awesome: 1/2 off all bottles of wine - by glass or bottle - and that goes down quite well in my books - thank. you. very. much. a few yummy appies at GR8 prices. luv the angel hair pasta with basil & tomatoe sauce - i add chicken. i know which waitress will be a relaxing experiencing - and which one, (when she walks toward me i go - o no.... please no...) will not be so fabby...

The service is pretty atrocious, if you like pasta served with a side of serious attitude and douchiness, you would love Scarpetta.

 We went here for dinner a couple of days back for a celebration. We first chose to sit at a booth. Those seats were incredibly uncomfortable, the back rests are too thick which makes the seat really small, so we moved to a table. We started with an appetizer -- aloo tikki, which was good, but the chutneys could have been more flavorful. We had baingan bharta (eggplant) which was pretty much burnt and panneer tikka masala which was normal. The breads were good (but the aloo naan was too thick in my opinion) and the veg briyani was pretty ok-ish. The lassis were not bad. While we were waiting for our food, there was a big party with a kid who was just let loose and was running from one table to another. Before we could realize what was happening, he just threw up next to us. His parents were least bothered and just wiped him up, continued eating and the kid got back to running. We were disgusted to say the least and the waiter moved us to another table. But even after they cleaned up the mess, we could smell vomit throughout the time we were there. They should have used a strong disinfectant, i strongly suspect they used only water to clean it. So anyway, we lost our appetite, ate very little, skipped dessert and took the rest of the food home. With mediocore food and bad ambience, our experience wasn't all that good. One star for the service, one star for the panneer dish. ",0,1,0,0,0

We ordered veggie omelet and a skillet, and they were both amazing. The omelet was very good in portion and quality (4 eggs ones oh yeah), and the skillet was just amazing. Based on their prize, they were definitely worth going back again. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is our favorite Metro to go to. There are prettier new locations, but the decor of this location keeps us coming back. We affectionately call it the ""ghetto"" Metro. A run down looking throw back to the 80's. But the pizza is the best and we've never had any real problems with the staff. We usually go during 1/2 price time and the quantity of toppings and overall quality are never skimped on. Same as their full price pizzas. The are a bit pricey, hence going during 1/2 price, but even when paying full price it is worth the money with the quality ingrediants. Metro, any location, is the best. You should not miss out on this!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 The serendiptious joy of finding this place was trebled when, for our Friday night reservation, two of our guys came straight from the airport, having just of flown in from the East Coast. They were a little jaded and needed a pick me up. "" Vodka and Red Bull"" they asked of our buxom and broad shouldered server. None of us knew what was coming next, and boy was it a magnificent joyful pleasure. The sheer terror on our friend's face as he was asked to clench his fists, lock his knees and spread his legs. She even asked him to move to the vacant table beside us, as she could not get a good swing in as there was a pillar blocking her at our table. There were tears in his eyes, and he may never order Red Bull again. Great food, great beer, great beer hall atmosphere. ",0,0,0,0,1

 $8 for a beer, $16 for a cocktail and up to $50 for a cigar (Opus X - $22 for a AF Short Story), so yeah, this place is expensive. You can bring your own with no fee but a 1 drink minimum is required. Waitress have very sexy skirts which are fun to watch, but it's not really a cigar place - it's just cigar friendly. I was at Up but the Parsol Down has a nicer view and outside area. Worth a visit if you are staying a the amazing Wynn/Encore complex, but I much prefer the Foundation Room or Casa Fuente when not staying at the hotel. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Within my first hour at Beacher's, I saw: - A woman with the biggest boobs I'd ever seen crush beer cans, a watermelon and 3 wooden boards with her massive chest. - Midgets attached to a harness flying over the club delivering bottles to tables - A girl puking into her friend's hand as they were sprinting out of the club (true friendship) - To my shock and surprise, my wife being excited to see Pauly D (is it 2010 up in here?) -Lots and lots of confetti It's a club without a dance floor. If you're not getting bottle service, you're kind of screwed since there isn't really anywhere to hang otherwise. It basically turned into a sea of humanity around 1am. The music was mainly 90's hip hop/R&B with some splashes of EDM. So the DJ rocks out for about 15 minutes and then there's a ""show"" which ranges from midget wrestling to magic to a Pee Wee Herman impersonator and then it goes back to the DJ. Most of the ""shows"" weren't that great. I felt like most of them actually killed the momentum of the party. Everyone is up on their feet jamming out to a fun tune, then they stop the music and everyone has to sit down to watch the show. I think people might have loved this stuff 10-12 years ago when Jeff Beacher first gained notoriety for his traveling band of freaks but not when Rose Rabbit Lie has stepped up this kind of game to a whole new level. The midget bottle delivery was still damn funny though. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I just started a job in this area... I went out at lunch to find the good eating establisments.. I was craving a gryo and saw this joint off eastern ave. I ordered the gyro 4.99 and stuffed grape leaves... The owners are very nice and accommodating... The food was ehhhh,, not very good in my opinion... The gyro was tasteless,, the cucumber sauce was bland and way runny, they do make a fresh baked pita,, that was ok but overall i was disappointed in the gyro... The grape leaves were 5.99 for 6, dollar a piece not worth the money... Again the food was bland... All in all, i was not impressed with this restaurant from the 2 items i ordered... I would not recommend this place to yelpers... ",0,1,0,0,0

 I am from out of town and have a second home in Scottsdale. When I'm in town I usually make it a point to dine at least once at this restaurant,. I like the location (DC Ranch), ambiance, menu, wine list and service (outstanding). I am becoming disillusioned due to the kitchens inability to cook a steak properly. This is the second time I have experienced this issue. The first time my girlfriend and I came in for the steak and lobster special. The lobster was cooked perfectly, but the steak was overcooked. We sent them back and this time mine was acceptable and hers was again overcooked. The third time for her was the charm. The evening proceeded perfectly and the management graciously comped our meals. Most recently I came in with a party of six, again for the steak and lobster special. Again all of us that ordered the steak and lobster (4) had the steaks overcooked. We returned them and the second time they were as we ordered them. Again we had the meals comped that were not cooked to order. Gilling steaks is not ""rocket science"". I hope that management takes note of this issue, and better supervises the cook line. I eat at Flemings for a variety of reasons, and getting a ""free"" meal is not one of them. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Aliante Station casino and buffet are really nice. The casino has the whole brown and orange color scheme going on. I guess that's in again. The buffet is what I concentrated on. We were there with lots of family, so a big group, including some kids. The food was pretty good and the staff very friendly. I have no thought on the price, since another family member paid for us all. I've also been to their movie theater with a friend, which was like any other movie theater experience to me. All-in-all I'm a fan, I'll be back. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Mojo is a neighborhood favorite. It's easily the best breakfast offering in North Scottsdale, and it's great for grab and go during the work week because of their 6:30 opening time. The staff is very nice and they always greet you with a smile. My personal favorite has got to be the mojo burrito - this isn't your run of the mill breakfast burrito. It's a bit more than a ""-berto's"" burro but the ingredients are fresh, and the chicken chorizo is much more tasty than greasy pork chorizo you find in other places. They can make just about any morning drink you would need, from iced coffee to blended fruit smoothies. The patio is dog friendly and they even provide fresh drinking water for them. Check this place out if you are in North Scottsdale, you won't be disappointed. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Used to be my favorite place for chicken & curry until I came in for my to-go order & saw the chef through the order window boxing my food with his bare hands. I'm sure my food is touched with bare hands at restaurants more than I probably realize ... but when I asked the bartender if that's what I really saw, she gave me the excuse ""That's all he touches. That's his spot."" (yeah right - hard to believe he stands there like a statue all night and only places his impecably clean hands on food alone.) so I replied ""he isn't supposed to be wearing gloves?"" No gloves in my own kitchen .... fine. No gloves in a restaurant .... totally grossed out. Come on, even the Subway two doors down from this place puts on gloves every single time. Offering to remake my food would have been nice. Still undecided if I'll be back - and that's saying a lot since they have a ton of great beer on tap and I could avoid ordering food. Beware chef does not wear gloves! ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is one of my all-time favorite places to grab a quick (and casual) bite downtown. The service is consistently excellent, and the owners are extremely friendly. They are flexible with their menu, too - they do their best to get you exactly what you want. I recommend the stuffed avocado salad. It's a special, and boy is it amazing. The fruit here is also superb - always so fresh! My friends and I swear they have someone designated to just cut fruit all day, it's so fresh. The hummus is the best hummus in town. Get it with extra veggies! The only downfall Athenian has is it's hours. Monday thru Friday til 5, closed on the weekends. No fun for those of us who live in the area. But other than the short hours, this is one of my favorite places in the area - I would recommend it to anyone. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I loved the store. Its a nice airy store with all the baby needs anyone could want plus some. The registry was relatively easy to access and was great because I had a print out with exactly the mommy to be needed. The only problem I can see with the store is that because it is so large they could use some signage to help wrangle patients a little better. I felt like I was walking up and down aisles like a lost child. lol Although i'm sure this tactic is great for business as i'm sure they have some great impulse buys from wandering. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I am happy to update my very poor review of Cibo from several months ago and get on the fan bandwagon with all of my fellow Yelpers. I also want to thank the proprietors who took my previous review seriously and encouraged me to give them another opportunity. I wish it hadn't taken me so long to get back to Cibo (life tends to get in the way!!) and believe me, it won't be long before my next visit. We returned for lunch today and were seated right away. The place wasn't near as busy as the last visit because many had Columbus Day off work. Our server welcomed us promptly and took our drink orders. We decided on hot sandwiches: Sicilian sausage and pulled pork. OMG - they were soooo delicious!!! The pork was lean, tender and in a wonderful spicy (but not overly) sauce. The Fontina cheese was a great touch and tasteful. The bread...ummmmm good. I'm tired of getting sandwiches on so much bread that you can't open your mouth wide enough to bite - the grilled saltimbocca bread was so good! The sausage sandwich was super flavorful with the perfect amount of peppers and onions. Again, the bread complimented the sandwich. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it took a while to get our bill. While we weren't in a hurry, the server walked by our table a couple of times and didn't check in on us. As I mentioned the place wasn't overly busy at all so I would have expected a tad more attentiveness. But overall, the food was outstanding and the quaintness of the little house made for nice ambience. I'm not a fan of eating crow, but if I have to, I will. I bet the chef at Cibo could even make crow taste phenomenal! ",0,0,0,1,0

 While we were happy to finally have what looked like a decent place in Forest Hills, we were skeptical about whether the new restaurant would compare to alternatives in Shadyside et al. We were not disappointed. The pork osso bucco is amazing, first of all. It's both delicious (one of those meat dishes that's been cooked on the bone in some kind of savory sauce for a long time) and impressively presented. We also had the calamari for an appetizer, which was not overcooked, too salty, or too greasy as fried calamari often can be. I also thought the basil dipping sauce was something new. The tiramisu looked amazing, but we were too full to try it - next time! It was nice to see that they have a gluten free menu for friends with dietary concerns, or for the days when we're trying to be healthy :) The beer and wine selection are both great with a wide range of prices and international selection. The atmosphere is pleasant. It's festive but not too loud, the tables aren't too close together, they have a number of TVs with sports around, and you can see the wine cave. There's also a white grand piano near the entrance, haha. We sat inside, but the patio looks nice. We walked, but it looks like parking is easy enough. The waitstaff needs further refining, but we expected that given that the place is new. We could at least see that they were very eager to please and fix any errors. ",0,0,0,0,1

 An above average beer selection. But food could have been better. We ate here on St Paddy's Day. Corned beef brisket with cabbage and potatoes. Not good.

 My first visit here was an hour wait. I ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Salad and the banana mocha..I did not think I'd be able to finish that salad but it was soooooooooooooo good with that crispy fried chicken that I finished just about the whole plate. I kid you not, but the portions at this restaurant are meant for giants! That banana mocha was the best mocha I had in my life. My second visit was Hash House in San Diego with my bf. We drove from Irvine to SD JUST for Hash House! The wait was only 15 minutes long and it was his first time there. He ordered the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and I ordered the Corned Beef. We also had the Blood Orange Soda, which got us so addicted to it that he searched and found it at a store in Orange County. The food was just as good and we picked our bellys up and walked out of the restaurant proudly with a huge grin on our face. We stopped by the SD Wilderness Park after and burnt off our lunch walking and skipping (not really because we were so full we could barely skip) around like little kids. It was one of the best date ever! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Yes, I know Whole Foods is evil and any real, self respecting hippie wouldn't be caught dead shopping here. Luckily, I am only about 3/8 hippie. Back in Portland I wouldn't shop at WF very often because there are better stores. But in Chandler there just isn't anything that compares. I love the selection, the focus on local products, the produce is always beautiful, and the bulk section is pretty decent. They have a huge beer selection, and a pretty good wine selection as well. I even did some price comparisons, and I was surprised to find that WF is actually cheaper than Sprouts on many items. The only thing I won't buy here regularly is meat, because the prices are pretty high. However, if you are looking for a hard to find cut, you might have better luck here than other stores. One way they could greatly improve is if they offered a bulk spice section. You really can't call yourself a natural grocery store and not have bulk spices. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Went here on a Friday night with a friend for some beer and good Southern cooking. The beer was good but I was ultimately disappointed with the food. We shared a pulled pork sandwich, a plate of baby back ribs and fried chicken. The pulled pork sandwich was the only good thing we ate that night. The meat was tender and the bun to meat ratio was acceptable. Coleslaw as a side was traditional and served its purpose. The ribs were mediocre at best. It was a bit dry and the BBQ sauce had a bit too much molasses for my liking. The fried chicken was the worst I've had in awhile. One piece was so dry I couldn't eat it. I asked for yam fries and they gave me half regular fries and a small portion of yam fries. Sigh. The service was awesome but I don't think I'll be coming back here unless it's for the pulled pork. Let's hope they improve. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This place is not too far from the east side of Madison. The place is a great break from a place like Pedro's, Loredoes or Fridas. The food is really authentic, usually served hot,quick and is not too hard on the budget. The menu has a great selection and very user friendly. If you have to kids along they have things like burgers and fries. The drinks are not outrageously priced, they have specials throughout the week. I absolutely love the margaritas. The service is sub-par. The waitstaff is very friendly, but they are not too attentive. That is too bad, I would give them a five for sure if it wasn't for the service. The place is very cozy, but not small. You can enjoy your company and have a great conversation without overly loud music or being interrupted too much. I would encourage you to try this place, but make sure to order water with your drink, you might finish your drink before the server gets back to you. haha:) The food is great and very authentic.

 It's restaurant week (RW) and I like going to a posh location for RW. I get all dolled up in a dress and heels and my boyfriend wears button down shirt and slacks. Silly me, I was not really expecting a Bistro, for some reason I was expecting something fancier with white linen table cloths or something like that for the price point. I felt overdressed. Well the candlelight was a nice romantic touch. We had a reservation and were seated immediately upon arrival at the corner table. There was live music on the patio which I always enjoy. Our waitress was nice and attentive. The busboys were also on top of their job which was great, I hate having dirty plates just sitting there while I'm chatting. We ordered off the special RW menu which came with a glass of sangria. I tried the white sangria which was light and fruity. I ordered the tostada for an appetizer and the boyfriend had the empanada. Both were pretty tasty. For Course 2 the boyfriend got the steak and cheddar mashed potatoes and I got the Seafood Chile Relleno with yummy cream corn and the most delicious cornbread. Both meals were good, no complaints but the portions were huge, we didn't even finish half of our meals. I got them to go. But not before having dinner, I got the chocolate bread pudding and he got the Banana Burrito. I didn't like the Banana Burrito. The bread pudding almost tasted bland but that could because I had so many different flavors in my Course 2 dishes. Anyway, I think I am not that partial to latin food so maybe that's why everything was just A-OK for me, not spectacular. It was worth the try though. ",0,0,1,0,0

 i've been dying to try out nobu and matsuhisa in LA for the longest time, but the thought of making a drive that far just for sushi just couldn't be justified...until now. Nobu is actually a japanese fusion restaurant, so for all of you purest out there, this is not your dining of choice. now for the food...the ingredients are what make japanese food such a delicacy. And when it comes to seafood, especially sashimi, if your stock isn't fresh, i can taste it. that said, we decided to stuff our faces for the true nobu experience. *the YK50 is a semi-dry and rather sweet sake that was super light *shishito peppers - grilled peppers w/ an extremely simple miso sauce w/ toasted sesame *tuna tataki. great sauce, perfect w/ the daikon and garlic chips. *kumamoto oysters. not the best i've had, the sauces actually took away from the natural sweetness of this variety of oyster. *yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapenos. probably my favorite of the meal. extremely simple sauce w/ a spicy bite. my mouth is salivating just thinking about it :p *sashimi salad. we got a tuna/hamachi mix instead. it had a delicious miso dressing on a medley spring mix *amai ebi. it was a little oily this time, but the shrimp was ridiculously fresh. *crunchy roll w/ king crab. probably my least favorite of the night. it was creative though with the crunch topping that gave a nice twist on the typical roll. *tempura plate. the vegetables were so sweet, it didn't even require the tentsuyu (tempura sauce) *fried shrimp w/ butter ponzu sauce. butter and ponzu is an amazing combination. so its not typical japanese but definitely try this one if you get a chance. i do believe i've never truly experienced a food coma until tonight.

 Let's cover what's good... Believe it or not, their food is very good for a sports bar. You wouldn't think it would be but it is. In addition, lots of TVs so every seat and table has a good view of several different games playing. But as everyone knows, it's how they run the restaurant that makes it or breaks it. This is where they fall down. I came in for Monday Night Football and they ran the Suns game through the central speakers instead if the game. Asked the manager how come... His answer, ""because that was what was first requested"". So I asked, ""whoever comes in first, sits down gets to decide what gets pumped through the speakers""? He said yes. Unbelievable! I sure hope nobody comes in early on Sunday and requests figure skating. 90% of everyone at Zipps was there for Monday Night Football but, instead, we listened to the Suns game. Management needs to be changed! I'm heading across the street to Hazzelwoods next week... I bet they'll know what to play on Monday Night! ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is only great if you are doing a pub crawl and it is a quick stop for a few drinks. I made the mistake of holding my birthday party here. With about ~20 attendees I made sure to make reservations weeks in advance. Things started off smoothly initially, the waitress was adequate. For a party that big, and considering the place wasn't swamped or anything (it was on a Thursday night), she did the bare minimum. Considering that she knew she was getting auto grat she felt no need to hussle. Also, why did they not designate a back up server for a party of that size? People were without drinks or drink refills for a long time. The food was overpriced and average at best. It took FOREVER to get the plates cleared and out of the way. When she realized she probably had already earned her 18% auto grat or whatever it was on a party that large, she pretty much jumped ship. You had to physically track her down, or wait a very very long time for her to come back around. The place itself looks cool with some interesting detail, but at that point, the decor was all they had going for them. I would not come back here to sit down and eat, nor would I suggest it to others.. Sure, come through, get a drink from the bar, take in the unique yet highly hipster decor and move on. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I hate to rain on the parade of 5 stars, but I was not impressed with my pizza. I ordered for delivery through foodie call and had a custom pizza made of goat cheese, proscuitto, and arugula - my go to. The pizza came within the expected time frame (45 minutes) and I was excited to give it a try. The first red flag (you can see by the picture) is all the toppings were plopped in the center. Who likes eating their pizza with no toppings on the outside and then mounds of it on the other side? I spent the next 5 minutes redistributing the toppings so it was evenly dispersed throughout the pie. Second, where was the proscuitto?! There were tiny cut up bits of what tasted like ham sprinkled on top, but definitely not the thin slices of salty, savory proscuitto deliciousness I was expecting. The ancient grain crust, however, was very good and I also enjoyed the brown sugar cinnamon dipping sauce that came with it. I'm willing to give Pure Pizza another try...but I'll surely be there in person to voice my criticisms. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was so excited to stay at this hotel. The pictures looked great, it seemed new and different. I grew up in Las Vegas but recently moved to San Diego. We were coming back for Christmas so we thought this would be the perfect time to try out this hotel. I booked the hotel well over a month in advance. We got a really good deal because we stayed 3 nights and had a AAA discount. We get to the hotel, getting into the driveway was a little confusing because the enter lane was blocked off but it didn't take long for us to find the entrance. We pull up, the hotel is valet only. That would've been nice to know. We go in to check in, no outside food or beverage. So, we couldn't have a pre-drink in our room and I was worried about the food I had brought from San Diego for Christmas. That was really annoying. I understand they want us to eat/drink at their restaurant, but we were going to anyway. The lobby/bar was very beautiful though and it smelt very nice. One of the valet drivers helps us with our luggage to the room, no elevators so we helped him take our bags off the cart and up to the room. We walk right into the doors that go into our building and our room was right there. Seemed convenient but we later found out it was horrible. That door was so loud that every time someone walked in or out of the building, we heard it all! There was not an iron or ironing board in the room, but they did have one available, but when you went to iron your clothes, water poured out. There was not a coffee maker in the room....ok no big deal. The bathroom was beautiful and the room itself was decorated nicely, the bed was comfortable. There was a patio but I had no desire to go out there since we were right at a brick wall. The pool are was really neat looking. It had great furniture. I tried to call for room service one night because my husband was fast asleep and it was 11:30 at night. The kitchen closes at 11:30. Ok that's fine but I couldn't bring up the food from the car because no outside food or beverages. And the phone didn't work. The handset must've had a dead battery because the speaker phone worked. And back to the valet only, since we didn't know, we didn't have cash on us to tip them with, so my husband told the valet driver that he was sorry but we didn't know it was valet only, we don't have a tip but we will get him when we come back and he just jumped out of the car and walked away! We did end up bringing cash back when we returned but he wasn't there. So yes, the room is beautiful, but the overall stay was a nightmare. I will not stay here again and I will not encourage my friends to stay there either. I've had a better stay at other cheaper hotels. ",0,1,0,0,0

Of course what does she bring me, a chicken quesadilla. LOL oh yea that's right i forgot to clarify with my server that when i said chicken strips and fries, i really mean chicken strips and fries! Not a crappy quesadilla. She didnt come by our table for another 10min, and by then i didnt want to wait another 15-20min for my correct order to come out so i made due with the junk infront of me. Yea it was junk, scraps of chicken that looked like it was microwaved or something, with tomatoes and cheese. One of the 4-5 slices didnt even have the crappy chicken in it!?!?!! LOL so.....idk like i said, you must lower ALL of your expectations when you go to IHOP this late, especially if you're not ordering breakfast items. So i guess in a way this is my fault for not expecting even worse.......but don't get me wrong, IHOP is good for breakfast, and i'd normally give it 4-4.5 stars ",0,1,0,0,0

 Very Good, But Not Memorable I went here with two friends, and we ordered the menu that allowed us to select two appetizers, two entrees, and one desert. In doing so, we were able to try a lot of the dishes. The food was delicious, sometimes borderline amazing, but all in all, a bit underwhelming. The service was okay, but nothing that rises to the level of a Michelin star. After finishing the meal, the only thing I was thinking was that Guy Savoy is better. If you are fortunate to be able to afford a meal like this, choose Guy Savoy. The service, food, and d \ u00e9cor are a level above Joel Robuchon. (I also found that L'Aterlier was also underwhelming. Maybe the quality in Vegas just slipped. Either way, at this price point, underwhelming is unacceptable.) ",0,0,0,1,0

 This Pink's serves up tasty dogs for sure - but I suppose it's all about the toppings. I opted for the cheesy-grilled mush/onion-bacony goodness of the Planet Hollywood Dog (I guess a new creation just for this Las Vegas location) which was exactly what I'd expect a polish piled with melted cheese, grilled stuff, and good bacon to taste like. My only qualm is the outdoor-only seating where you see large hordes of asian families hovering around the deck heaters (perhaps this was simply a product of being here around Christmastime), and the pricing - which is a little more than I'd expect out of a hot dog (considering for the price I could have a pretty decent lunch at a many a sit-down restaurant).

 Uuuuugggghhhhhh....cheese..and..... eggs............. Eggs and cheese......... Went here on a Friday night because it's talked about a lot by my coworkers, and there is always a line out the door. Got seated quickly somehow --by the time we left, the wait was nearly 45 minutes-- got our water and chips/salsa. Pedestrian chips and salsa and I ate too many as usual waiting. Everything on the menu looked just like a menu at Everyman's Mexican restaurant. I am always drawn to the 'house special' or 'specialties of the house' or 'chef's specials' or 'House specials of the chef'. Somehow I always think of an old Mexican lady in the kitchen fighting back tears of nostalgia from younger days in Olde Meheeko when she sees that someone as brave as me has ordered a family favorite. (No no no Jeffro, it is just not so.) In this case, it was the chile relleno. I'm a big fan of these chiles stuffed with plain cheese then battered and fried. I should have noticed the slight rise in the waitresses eyebrow when I made my choice audible, or the sudden silence as patrons ushered their children close and nefarious men went for their sidearms. Back in the kitchen, the cooks certainly chuckled and shrugged their shoulders in a combination of silky knowing and territorial pissing. This is our Special a la casa, and you will be surprised that you can be liking it!! Soon others will come!!!! What arrived at the table seemed like a mistake. This is not food -it is a sacrifice. A large head-sized, head/brain-looking mound of food. ""What is this?"" I asked the waitress. She told me it is a special way of preparing the chile and that I would find the tasty morsel somewhere near the bottom of the football-sized mound of eggy souffle. I put my fork in expecting a gasping escape of air and a seconds-later reasonable sized dinner. No. If anything, it got larger (that's what she said). I went for it, but like Shackleton at the pole, I was stuck 20 minutes later. With my spouse finishing her enchiladas, I was still less than 1/3 into the meal and forever sworn from chile rellenos. The eggs alone must have skinnied a flock of chickens, the cheese gave Wisconsin a shudder, and the paltry pale anemic chilles resting in the cellar of the mess were no longer in my future as energy and waste product -I had had enough! Giving up and stating so left me feeling free like a recovering alcoholic taking the first step. There is some British research which shows that wild rabbits relax sometimes for the first time in their lives just before death when finally caught by a circling hawk. They no longer live in fear. I no longer live in fear of the TeePee--- I have been caught by the Chile Relleno. Stay hungry my friends, but order a la carte. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This review is for the bar attached to the restaurant...which by the way serves the full Sammy's menu 24/7. Kevin B. and I stopped in here last week for some chow after work at about 8. The place had quite a few patrons inside...many of which seemed to be regulars. Despite the fact that the sole bartender was running both the bar and lounge area we received really great service. He greeted us immediately upon sitting down and provided great service throughout the meal. Our beers were comp'd for play and the pizza was quite good; we had the New York Style with mushrooms, pepperoni, salami, and italian sausage. The pizza size is plenty to share if you have a salad or an app. There's also a touch-tunes machine in the bar that you can use to play your own music for 50c per song. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I went in the other day and tried the green tea and plain. Both were rather melty straight out of the machine so it was almost all melted by the time I got in the car. I got a small plain w/ mochi, blueberries and strawberries. At first, I only wanted two toppings, but the worker (presumably the owner) said it costs the same for 3... so, that's kinda annoying to HAVE to pay for 3 toppings ($3.95 I think). Whatever. Some of the toppings (the dry stuff and the browned banana slices) didn't look all that appetizing, but the (other) fresh fruits weren't bad. The mochi was a bit soft for my taste. The worker gave me two cards for a buy one get one free offer so I'll probably be back. I'll give them awhile to (hopefully) improve first though. It's relatively close to my house so I really want them to succeed! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have been at this school for going on 3 years now. The teacher is excellent and has been doing martial arts for a very long time. He brings some levity into serious training. You feel very worked out after a class, but you enjoy the class as you take it. Weapons training, forms, application. The school offers a great deal and the teacher is very knowledgeable and approachable when teaching or even just popping by the school for extra practice. If you are expecting a hardcore place that has you punching bags until your knuckles bleed, this isn't the place for you. If you are expecting a place that is 'disney-ified' then this also isnt the place for you. If you want a good teacher, with a sound foundation of skills and also has a knack for making classes both informative and enjoyable, then this place will definitely be for you. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Even though this place had three stars (and three $ signs, which made my cheap side a little worried) I still had heard a lot of good word of mouth, so I wanted to try it out. I went about this dining process by rating it as the action started. Our server walks up to us and asks if we had ever been there. His response was great, telling us all about the farm to table experience they try to create there. He was extremely helpful in picking out our drinks, Lyeth Meritage for me...at $14 a glass...YIKES. But it was really light and refreshing for a red wine. My friend got a gin and tonic, the gin being infused with cucumber deliciousness (I assure you, I tried it a couple times). We're 5 stars at this point folks. We both decided on the tasting menu since everything looked good. $35 for three courses is pricey for me, but I was splurgin' here (dah, $14 wine). To start I choose the Wild Mushroom Flatbread. Now bear in mind, I thought the tasting menu portions would be, well, tasting size. It was regular appetizer size, you know, for like two people. I ate almost all of it....other than the piece I shared with my friend. It was THAT good. Porto mushrooms, pesto and feta cheese. YUM! Still 5 stars people. I was torn between a the healthy Sonoma Salad and the Pecan Crusted Haluomi. Since my friend is generous, she said she'd get the cheese and give me a piece. Win win! The salad was good but the Haluomi...holy crap! It was amazing! I cannot believe it's served as a whole meal. It comes with potatoes and broccoli, but I would need something else. Even though cheese does fill lots of voids in my life. At this point we've downgraded the score to 3 stars because our second course came out AN HOUR after our first course was served. The server came by only once to say our courses would be close together (because we were going to a show and in a rush at this point). He never came by to ask if I wanted another glass of wine (a no, but still). Or just to tell us the kitchen was running slow tonight, etc. I would have taken any excuse. But there was nothing. Final course was the Crispy Indonesian Glazed Duck. Don't get me wrong, it was VERY good and crispy, but I thought the glaze overpowered it enough where I felt like I was eating at a Chinese restaurant....where my meal would have been $8. Regardless of the wait times I still thought the meal was solid, if not a tad overpriced. Would I go back? Yes. Would I soon or frequently? Probably not. The mystery of the 3 star rating has been solved. Sonoma Grill, get on your game, you could be a 5 star! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I went with three friends for St. Patrick's Day (and it was a Saturday). We parked in the back and had such a hard time trying to find check-in. We were constantly getting lost in this place. We had booked two suites but when we got there the man at the check-in counter recommended that we upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite, Augustus Tower Senator Suite. It was actually cheaper for us to get that room for all 4 of us instead of just two separate rooms. That room was amazing. It had a double door entry, a huge living room with a table that seated 6, 4 bathrooms, bidet, large whirlpool tub, two bedrooms, great view. We were in heaven. So many amenities, I could have left my toiletry bag at home. Fantastic time at the beautiful Caesar's Palace. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Well I LOVE this hotel (Cosmopolitan) so I researched restaurants to pick one for lunch. All I needed to see was ""Bamboozled shakes"" with alcohol and my decision was easy!!! Went with the ""Drunkin monkey"" because it had my FAV frangelico!! I'm sure it has about 1000 calories, but hey... You know what they say, ""what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas""... So let's hope that includes calories too!!! I also had the ""machete"" burger. Chili peppers, garlic sauce, YUM!! Then all the usual choices for side items like onion rings, sweet potatoe fries or regular fries. It was all amazing so now I need to go back to try one of everything else on the menu! I especially liked that they had so many other options other than burgers! Turkey, chicken, salmon and lamb!! Something for everyone!! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Once upon a time, my partner made the mistake of purchasing an old Subaru off Craigslist. This car, while it looked good, turned out to be a total lemon. After taking it to three separate places for an issue that never got fixed, he finally broke down and took it to the dealership here. Fortunately, after two visits here, the mechanics were able to temporarily fix his issue, but it cost him nearly $2000. Less than two months later, his car broke permanently. Let me make it clear that the car did not break due to any fault on the mechanic's part; the car was just a lemon. The mechanics were nice and able to diagnose a problem 3 other mechanics could not find, but it was quite expensive. It was a bit frustrating that it cost so much money to determine that the car was not worth investing further money into repairs. Now, we will go forward to the great experience - purchasing a car. Since the repairs were out of the price range, we decided it was time to buy a new car. This is where this place shined. My partner told them a price range and the salesman helped him get everything set up. We checked the value of the car we were purchasing beforehand, and the price really did reflect the value of the car (which is rare at big dealerships like this). The staff people in the sales department were great, and both of us left there feeling like we got a good bargain. They made everything really easy. I'd highly recommend this place to purchase a car for a good value. I give the service department 2 stars and the sales department 4 stars. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Was here for lunch on 11/20/2010. I ordered a Gyro (platter). It was quite good. I love these and had not eaten one in a very long time. I found the side of greek salad lacking a bit, it had enough cheese & dressing, but otherwise was all lettuce (only one olive). I would have liked to see more ""stuff"" in the salad. The ""lamb"" was a little dry, not ready to believe its always this way though. Having only eaten here once, this may have only been the luck of the draw, not sure. I will certainly try it again.

 Great restaurant. Went here for breakfast after a long hike on Camelback, I believe I got a veggie hash. It was pretty good, though nothing stellar. The toasted olive bread it came with (you get a choice, and I chose olive bread), was very good, really enjoyed that. My friend got their jalapeno pecan pancakes, and I had a bight of that, and thought it was pretty amazing. Really liked the contrast of spicy and sweet. Service was good, everyone was friendly and as fast as could be expected for a busy Saturday morning. Atmosphere was nice, and overall the establishment was comfortable, clean and inviting. I would definitely go again, as I would be curious to try some other items on their menu, but at the same time there are other breakfast places I love and would choose to go to. So we'll see.

 After walking past this place time after time I finally decided to go in and see what all the fuss was about at lunch time. This was further provoked by the fact they finally took down the scaffolding that had been obstructing it for the best part of last semester. There are comfy couches and a few tables but it's not huge by any means. The staff are lovely and friendly and do not try and rush you with your choice just because it's busy (I am a picky eater). I had a Danish pastry and a tea, all very yummy, but my friend's sun-dried tomato, mozzarella and basil pesto was delicious and the bread was soft and fresh. Definitely stands out from its neighbouring sandwich bars, and great to grab something and head for the Meadows in the sun! ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place is a hole in the wall and at the back of a dumpy strip mall. I read good reviews on it, so the hubs and I decided to try this place out. They stated that they fry their chicken wings fresh and not frozen wings. The wings were definitely tasty - I had the honey bbq ones. I also tried their Philly Cheese Steak which was also really good - but a little on the pricey side, considering it doesn't come with anything else but the sandwich. I've seen other yelper's complain about how this place is never open - and I came across this yesterday - as it shows their hours of operation during that time was ""Open"" so we drove there to find that they were closed. I saw on their Facebook, after the fact, that they were closed both Saturday and Sunday. They should announce that on their answering machine or post on their door. Not everyone has FB. I wish they cared more about their business because I'd like to come back and try it again. They've stated a couple of times that they had family emergencies...so if that's legit, then fine, but it seems that it happens quite often. ",0,0,1,0,0

Room wasnt ready at 3.30 when we checked in and we were asked if we wanted 2 queens when we booked a king. Baggage was a disaster as you have to go outside and wait in another line.

 Aaahhhh quick recap - Pizza - not as good as I remember. Maybe it was too much sauce? Maybe it was the taste of the sauce? Maybe it wasn't hot enough? Maybe it was me? It just didn't cut it for me.

 I grew up eating Cheddar's. It's a smaller chain that doesn't advertise and how consistent, cheap food that's actually pretty good. My husband and I were excited one finally opened up in Arizona, specifically the Phoenix area, even if that location is way out in Chandler. It's a big restaurant, so a wait usually isn't too bad. The food ranges from eh to pretty good to hey this isn't too bad. For appetizers, the onions rings aren't bad, and neither is the queso. For entrees, you can get some healthier options. I usually like the veggie plate with a salad. Chicken fried steak is a good staple, and the burger isn't bad (although you have to order fries separately). The Caesar salad pasta is an interesting take on two dishes - basically a big Caesar salad on top of a bed of pasta. Desserts are all pretty good too. Mixed cocktails are fun and the painkiller is actually strong. If you're on a budget and in the Chandler area, especially if you have kids, Cheddar's is a good way to go. I like to eat here when I'm homesick and trying to save some money. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This store is a must for visiting fishermen from Hawaii. There are many items here which you only see online, in catalogs or on tv. A good friend of mine recently gave me a hot tip, try rigging the old curly tail using two beads and a prop. He said that at times, its almost like cheating. The prop is a fly fishing item, not to be found back home. It was available here in two sizes, in nickel and brass. As for clothes, its the start of spring meaning clearance on winter clothes, not too helpful for shoppers from Hawaii. I am guessing that fall would be the best time for visitors from Hawaii.

 The Yellow tail Tuna Sashimi was ok. But the crab roll 'sushi' rice looked like rice from the previous night. It was dry and didn't taste fresh at all.

 My boyfriend said that this place could be the Russian version of Hooters. Why? He really enjoyed the waitresses with no pants and low cut, tight tops. The restaurant is very big so we didn't have to wait for a table which is pretty unusual for the strip on the weekend. The prices are really reasonable starting at about $9. As for the food...I was pretty impressed. I really like the rising phenomenon of build your own burger themed restaurants. It makes my picky eating so much less obvious. They offer a large selection of toppings including some odd ones like fried mac and cheese and short ribs. Perhaps a bit lacking in the variety of sauces but I was still able to make a yummy creation. No, I didn't get the fried mac and cheese on my burger. Maybe next time. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place is somewhat strange. I'm not really into trying to make vegetarian food look like real food. The taste of everything was good enough, but the ""meat"" items had a weird after taste to them. I'm not sure whether it's some sort of psychological thing. Perhaps my mind was expecting some other taste when I bite into a veggie shrimp. In any case, the experience wasn't incredibly pleasant as it could have been.

 THEhotel is all about comfort and class. From their lobby, to the lobby lounge, to the coffee bar, to the cafe, THEhotel is in a class above the standard Mandalay Bay offerings. All their rooms are suites...725 sf or larger. The rooms are huge and impeccably decorated in dark woods, mirrors, suede, and glass. It's more like a boutique hotel with metropolitan flair. The beds are magnets...you just can't get out of it once you lay down...it's true, they are comfortable. A TV and phone can be found in almost every room of the suite (living, bedroom, main bathroom) except the guest bathroom. The main bathroom is huge as well with a separate shower and tub sitting in the corner...we probably could've set up a roll-away bed in there and still have enough room to walk around. Maybe next time. It's a shame that we didn't really get to enjoy the room and all its amenities. The plasma TV is eye catching, and the couch, just as comfortable as one of the beds. The mini bar was stacked, but came with a price tag. My main beef...$11/day for internet use. How can you pay so much for everything else and they not offer free internet??? 1/2 star deduction for no free internet.

Another of our party lit up a cigarette and one of the bus boys came over and pretty rudely told her to put it out. I see where the guy was coming from but the attitude was unnecessary.

 I love sushi, and tend to eschew the all you can eat places for being of lower quality sushi. A buddy asked if I wanted to get some sushi at this new place in Chinatown and he mentioned it was an all you can eat place. I went anyone and therefore it was a surprise to me that the food was actually pretty good. For 25 dollars, you can have all you can eat sushi/sashimi, which is not bad. It is the best all you can eat that I have found. However, the service wasn't that great. We placed our first orders on the sheet and we only received half of them. So we had to place another order for more food which extended our time in the restaurant. I will chalk it up to the restaurant being relatively new. I will go back and check it out with a smaller group next time. ",0,0,1,0,0

 If you're new to Charlotte and want to see what Southern food consists of, K & W is the sm \ u00f6rg \ u00e5sbord! Beyond the sterotypical fried chicken and collard greens, you'll get the idea of how our grandmas cooked. The heat lamps and excessive seasoning puts a slight damper on taste, but it's better choice than Golden Corral or Shoneys. *Shudder* If I'm jonesing for some comfort food and sweet Southern hospitality, this place is it. I'm a creature of habit, so I'll list some of my favs in no particular order: -Roast beef (sliced when ordered) with au jus -Mac n Cheese, homemade, baked, using slightly sharp cheese -Garlic Texas Toast -Chocolate Pie loaded with fresh-tasting whipped cream -Glazed carrots (is there any other way?) The line moves pretty fast, even at busy times. You can expect the after-church crowd on Sundays, but its otherwise steady flow of traffic. Hint: If you abhor the idea of cafeterias, this is NOT your restaurant. But if you can stand a dozen sweet grannies asking ""What can I get you, hon?"" (which is about as intolerant as Sunday afternoon naps in my opinion), you're gonna love it! ",0,0,0,1,0

 After my first visit here I was a fan and couldn't wait to go back. But the second visit killed the hype and I'm not sure I will be going back. They were out of too many things for an 8pm dinner on a Friday; from fresh bread to wine glasses and a bunch of specials and sides! The servers seemed frazzled and tired, and it wasn't until we made a comment about the poor service did we even get napkins on our table... Sigh! The ambiance was still wonderful - 5 stars for that, the food was mediocre at best - our bread was stale, the eggplant and zucchini chips were okay, the funghi pizza was a little dry and our corvina unfortunately smelled quite fishy. The service was not so great - perhaps just growing pains from the new found popularity? We did get good wine recommendations from the bar manager, so plus points for that. On a less busy day I'm certain the experience would you much better. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Overall we had a great experience here. It is hard to find nice vegetarian places when traveling. The smoothies were awesome. The selections of items were great as well. The one thing that was a turn off was there secret ""cheesecake"". We asked what was in it and was told it was top secret and can't be told. This was because people might make it at home. I'm sorry but most people can never make the same recipe from a restaurant even if they try. I own a restaurant and give away all of my recipes. I am honored when people ask for recipes. So of course we skipped dessert :( ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is one of my new favorite places to eat in Vegas. I took my fiance here for his B-Day and had dinner and we were impressed with everything that we ordered. We came back again for happy hour and I would recommend going to their happy hour since dinner can be pricey ( but worth it). I have major cravings for their Siberian Nachos !! ",0,0,0,0,1

 A gigantor Canadian Tire with helpful staff who are patient and giggly with your wisecracking, receipt-inspecting Mum. Wide aisles excellent for pushing carts piled high with bookshelves and paint cans, and for contemplating future home projects at your own speed. The lights went on and off randomly when we were there recently, and not near closing time, but aside from that, plenty fine. Lots of parking, close to Marche Central. ",0,0,0,1,0

 If you're going to a Brazilian steakhouse, you either know what you're getting into, or someone should tell you that you should do the buffet. (If you're going to a seafood restaurant, you're missing the point if you're ordering a cheeseburger.) SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT. Or take it with you to go. I got two to go...(five layer chocolate cake ..and Flan) and I regret nothing. Little lady had cheesecake. Dessert was a show-stealer. The chocolate cake was flawless. Thinking of going just for dessert, I kid you not. Service, selection, and quality is not Fogo de Chao, ...but the price is quite a bit less, and that counts for a lot. Atkins friendly! ",0,0,0,1,0

 My husband and I picked this place based mostly on the reviews on here... and the price! $82.49 total for a Thursday and Friday night in late April. It was pretty much as described! Free parking was a major selling point, although I wish there was a non-valet option. I'm not sure if the license plate on our rental was as bent when we got the car as when we picked it up after first parking it... but they validate you at the hotel check in, so that was easy! It's a very compact casino floor when you first walk in, yet they have squeezed in boxes for scantily clothed go-go dancers to gyrate on between the tables... not my favorite part but I'm sure all the men enjoy it! After we went up to our, as described, newly decorated but VERY TINY room, my hungry husband enjoyed a VERY large turkey sandwich and a jumbo shrimp cocktail at the deli at midnight. I thought the sandwich was overpriced, but the lady stacked it high and made it worth the dollars, so for vegas, I guess it wasn't too bad! The next night, around the same time (dinner time in Vegas I guess!) we tried the restaurant in the casino. I had the veggie burger (boca patty, I believe) and the husband had the prime rib special. This vegan sat as far from him as I possibly could to avoid any meat spray. The boca was fine although the fries were bland and cold. It was midnight though, so, who cares really. The husband said that the prime rib was good... the parts that weren't fat and gristle. Again, it was midnight, but ya know, (literally) watch what you eat I guess?? Back to the room... it was nice that the rooms were nicely decorated, but they could really use some new windows! Some that aren't single paned w/o broken window closures because FREMONT STREET IS SO LOUD!!! Til ooh 3 am probably it was nonstop crazy noise and we felt like we were sleeping in the middle of the street! Also not fun, the 6am garbage truck on Saturday morning since we were right over the alley... Also, the bed was not very comfortable. So... for a cheap place to rest your head in Vegas it'll do, but it's not any kind of resort if that's what you're looking for! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Small, but worthy of a good time. Why do they close at 2?!? KC Had the right Idea, so RD had to take a run at this place. RD had a great time, there is no Mrs. RD, so RD plays, because RD Pays. RD was surprised at the level of woman here... that some could actually be featured at the Rhino or Other Vegas Joints... but RD also saw a lot of the ""non-talent""... RD loves a good pole worker though... so those gals were awesome. RD wasn't feeling the pasties... but if that's the law...that's the law... RD found a problem with the place closing at 2... probably because of the alcohol sales... but RD isn't use to things ending at 2... so RD heads to Dream Girls... which closes at 4! ",0,0,0,1,0

 My friends and I weren't planning to come to this club on the last trip we went. One of the people in the our group just had a hook up so we went. From what I heard, it's a lot of older folks (mid-twenties to mid-thirties about), which is cool if that's what you're into. For younger groups, I'd recommend going to Pure or Tao. If I were older, I would probably like this place more and rate it higher. I really just wanted to check it out and see if it was nice inside. It was pretty interesting. I liked how it was by a waterfall outside. I didn't really expect to meet anyone or have the greatest time, however it did turn out to be a good time. It was my first time seeing some dude make it rain dollars here. I picked up like six of them. Being 23 years old, this isn't a club of my choice, but it's worth checking out if you've never been. You never know what can happen or who you'll meet. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Small, dark, themeless, nice drinks, lots of pretentious attitude, comfy booths, everyone stares and sizes up whomever walks in the front door and engages their coolness meter, fun patio, pool table, decent jukebox. Fun! Or... Bunch of tryhard scenesters covered in tattoos and piercings, trying to out-weird each other while swilling their PBR or whatever. OK, do I need to pick one? It's a fun place to go for a drink. This is not a Scottsdale bar. The crowd is mid 20's through mid 40's. Expect to see some goths, hipsters, rockabilly types, 80's industrial leftovers, lesbians on dates, perhaps a knife fight, people on their way home from work who stopped in to get plowed, and who knows what. I only started going here recently, but each time I've gone I've run into people whom I know from other places, which is kind of neat. I am getting the feeling that it's the kind of place I can show up and not necessarily have to bring my own company, but maybe that's just me. Other yelpers seem to think it's unfriendly. Whatevs! Maybe it's you. I brought two different first dates here recently. Later, neither turned out to be a great match for me, and neither of them really liked Shady's. There might be a correlation.

 This Paradise Bakery deserves better than one one star review. A recent visit here late one afternoon, but before the dinner hour rewarded us with our favorite fire roasted tomato soup. Indeed, I like it so much it's hard for me to order anything else, especially paired with a grilled cheese sandwich. Nothing better! This time I tried the asiago steak sandwich, which was good but a bit dry. The soups and salads look wonderful, and the turkey chili and Greek salad are other favorites. The wait staff were helpful and not unfriendly, but I did notice a bit of laxness at the checkout. Nobody there and customers with trays wondering what to do. I also observed people coming in not seeming to know what to do. There is a large ""Pay Here"" sign over the register, but no sign saying, ""Order Here"". Of course we'll be back. It's a welcome stop after shopping, A more prominent hostess to greet newcomers would be helpful. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Simple menu + tender chicken = Good Dropped in with the work team to try out Raising Cane's in Avondale, at the 10 and 101. It's basically a Five Guys but with chicken strips. Menu is simple and straightforward. The four meal options are a quick picker's heaven. Staff was nice and snappy with the service. And the amount of food you get for the money is an excellent deal.

 Where's the zoo keeper?! A monkey escaped! Yup. He sure did but the lil' guy was just chillin' and so were we. This small zoo is a bit awkward at first. Kinda feels like you're walking around someone's large backyard who happens to collect a bunch of animals. But you get used to it. Unlike the larger zoos, I didn't have to deal with parking or herds of people. It was just me, 5 other people and the animals. They actually have a pretty nice collection of rare animals like the albino wallaby and crocodile. Lots of little monkeys. My favorite part is when you get to go inside the bird enclosure and feed the parrots apples. Buckets of clean apple chunks are provided for you at no cost and all you have to do is hold a piece on your hand and the birds will come over and eat them off your hand. They are gentle and very friendly. I also like that you can get a boat tour and take the sky lift for less than $5 each. Very affordable. The ticket price may be a bit more expensive but I had a buy one get one free coupon which was helpful. So if you're ever headed out to BFE or wouldn't mind making the drive, its definitely worth it.

 The only reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because I guess I gotta give credit for their cool movie-related props on display. Otherwise, I would give the food here a 1 star rating for lower-than Denny's quality food for Cheesecake Factory prices. Now, you should stop reading this and decide to not eat here or to just step in and take a look around if you're into the whole movie prop/setting appreciation thing. We ordered: Spaghetti Pomodoro: Pretty much just pasta with marinara from the jar, and the portion was about a kid's meal size. Chicken broccoli pasta: They used a white creamy sauce that had no flavor, my gf had to add in pepper flakes and mix it with marinara sauce from my dish. The chicken breast was dry, cooked almost as bad as how I would cook it myself. Bacon cheeseburger: the 2 other friends each ordered this. Neither finished theirs, making a comment saying that the pictures on the menu are deceiving. I guess the most frustrating part of all this is the fact that the place was about half-full, and our food seriously took about 45 minutes or so to come out. And as you can see from what we ordered, there's no way it should've taken that long Cliff Notes: Avoid. ",0,1,0,0,0

 *3.5 Stars* This street that Mikado is located is hip, jiving, and what a great atmosphere! I loved how most restaurants made use of the sidewalk and put mini patios, but without making the space cramped. My bf mentioned that this used to be a Vietnamese restaurant, but the same owners decided to turn it into Japanese (?). Even though we arrived pretty late, the place was still packed. After we sat down, there were more people coming in. Because we weren't that hungry, my bf and I decided to order a couple of things to share: Agedeshu Tofu, Cod, and several rolls. Over all, the food was good. I loved the service. It was personable, and efficient, yet unhurried. A gentleman (part owner perhaps?) was patient in describing what their most popular dishes were. This is my first Japanese restaurant I tried in Montreal (and I am sure there are a lottttt more), but I wouldn't mind coming back here. It's in a great part of town and the food and service is great. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We've been to Nacho Daddy twice...it was fairly new the first time we went so they were still ""working on things"". We sat in the bar area for Happy Hour. There is a small appetizer section of the menu where you can get items half price during happy hour, so that was pretty good...but it's mostly bar type food (chicken fingers, sliders, etc). Great value, but we were a little surprised that they charge for chips and salsa. What Mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa??? Sure it's inexpensive, but isn't that the point...give your customers something. The food was decent, nothing worth noting. We went back tonight, sat in the bar area again and were hoping they may have worked out the new restaurant issues. The happy hour menu is the same. The sliders come in a choice of meats, but you cannot get one of each (the last time we went, you could). Apparently, the chef doesn't like to do that. Although the chef did, he wouldn't do it again when we went to order more for the table. They still charge for the chips and salsa, and there are only two lousy selections of beer at happy hour prices. I liked my strawberry margarita, but I seriously doubt there was any alcohol in it. Oh, and the chips were tasteless and stale. The food was okay...for happy hour prices, fine, but I wouldn't pay regular prices at this place. Can we bring back El Jefe's? ",0,1,0,0,0

 Looking at the prices I excepted authentic taste, originality and fine dining experience. It was Tuesday night only few tables occupied. Only one sever who did everything so the service wasn't up to the menu prices. Six pieces chicken momo was around $10. A lamb curry which only had a few small cubes was $16.95. It came with a very little white rice. The taste of lamb was little better than chicken momo but it does not worth paying that much money. The surprising thing was they only take cash!!!

 Real Foods, and Real Foods-esque shops are a bit like crack to me. They're totally addicting and I always end up buying things I shouldn't, or at least didn't intend to. So, as a concept I really like Real Foods. It's just this location which gives me the case of the 3 stars, and that's in comparison to the Broughton St location. It's *very* cramped, so much that whenever I paused to peruse the shelves I found I was in someone's way. I have found stocking to be a bit hit or miss as well, struggling to find exactly what I'm looking for when I know they carry it. One of the beauties of a store like this is that you wander around and find new an unusual things to spend/waste your money on - the setup here doesn't encourage that at all. Good for my wallet I guess, but not so good for the business. Most recently I came in to buy gift certificates - these can be bought online but if you DO buy them online, you can only use them online. What? What a strange and inconvenient system. Anyway, so I went to the store to buy them and they're actually kept in the back room somewhere so I had a reasonably extended wait while someone went to fetch these. An additional level of inconvenience. Staff were lovely while I waited, though, which certainly helps. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I'm still trying to wrap my brain around what happened yesterday. This is technically my second time going to this event... the first time, I was with my girlfriend at the time. Neither of us could handle being there for more than a few minutes, so we got our entry fee refunded and ate at a Mexican food place nearby (which was pretty disgusting if I remember correctly). This year, I was determined to check it out. I went with a few friends, and we wisely decided to get drunk before going. The Scottsdale Culinary Festival is a misnomer... it's neither culinary, nor a festival. At least it's actually in Scottsdale. It's more like a parade of drunk douchebags. My friend spent the day giddily taking pictures of d-bag shirts and dumb hairstyles. It's very different seeing them outside of the clubs. The food here was a joke... mostly chain restaurants. There wasn't anything culinary about it aside from the fact it was food. This city has some amazing unique restaurants, and it seemed like the sampling at the event wasn't representational of the kinds of fantastic ""culinary"" experiences one can have here. There's nothing really festival about this either. It's definitely an event, but apart from security, port-a-pottys, ""beer gardens,"" and wrist bands - it's just some boring food and drink. My biggest problem with it is that you have to pay to get in, then you have to buy tickets so you can buy food and drink. They should just raise the price of admission, and have the food be free plus a drink ticket or two. I mean, this should be about restaurants showing off what they can do to get people interested in eating there. The vendors at these booths all paid to be here. People pay to get in, and I'm sure the promoter makes a portion of the overall ticket sales. Whoever runs this thing is probably making bank off it. It's a huge sham when you think about it. Red Bull paid a ton to be there and have a premium spot - they weren't even giving their drinks away (which they often do at events like this). Overall, it was a big joke - but we managed to have fun. It was interesting people-watching, but beyond that there wasn't any reason to come. If I had to do this totally sober, I would've been miserable. Edit: After browsing the other reviews, it seems like I didn't completely understand the event. I wasn't aware proceeds went to charities, and I didn't see a lot of the restaurants other people listed. I guess at an event like this, everyone is going to have a different experience. ",0,1,0,0,0

I wasn't feeling the house room, but when i worked my way to the small back room which was spinning hip hop, i knew i was home. from the moment i walked in, i danced, my cousin danced, we shook our bumps and had a blast, even shook my tail feather to some Dead Prez, now that was nice... i came on a good night since theres a dj battle every[in this case, one selecta from the bay and the other was a vegas local in the image above] Thursday night apparently. the ventilation was good, no sweating profusely at this spot, they definitely keep the air chilled. i would've stayed later than 5:30 am but the cousin's feet were hurtin' so u know how that goes. nonetheless, we had a really dope time. come in with an open mind, good people, and a few drinks....and you'll leave with a smile, Drais will be a regular spot for me to visit every time I'm in Vegas. now, go on, get yo boogie on!

 In my book, Fox rental was a victim of circumstance. We flew in to Vegas Friday night to celebrate our friend's bachelor party. We had reservations to Craftsteak for a night of food awesomeness. The flight that we took was already about an hour late so it was really cutting in on our restaurant reservation. We were perplexed to find out the Fox rental is ""off"" the off-site rental building. I reckon that Fox rental was located in the off-site rental building. Alas, we waited for another 15 more minutes to be bussed off to Fox rental. It seemed like Fox rental was almost located at Henderson, pretty far. No problems. I would just sprint into the counter and be the first person to check in from our group. And then there was a line. There was a line from the previous shuttle. And we had to wait for about 30 minutes until I got to the front of the line. There were far and few employees for the amount of customers being bussed in. At that point we have missed our reservations at Craftsteak.To top it off, our car's breaks are down to the wear indicators. At least we were able to dine at Gallagher's in New York New York. Too bad, because if we had all the time in the world, Fox rental is pretty okay. Less than 20 bucks a day is undeniable, and the shuttle drivers were pretty cool. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have spent more time than I care to share in CLT but it is still my favorite airport.

I know where the decent food is at or if there is a TCBY nearby. It's like going to the mall in your hometown. I've already scoped it out and no where not to waste my time. They always have free wifi and you can find power outlets all over the place. It's easy to find a spot to plug in and get some work done or just relax in a rocking chair on the main concourse.

 I did not like Vegas. I will start the review by saying that, because as my Vegas experience was bad naturally I would feel similar about my accommodation. But to start, I did not like the hotel much it was in dire need of a refurbishment and was clearly showing it's age. The staff were friendly I will give them that but getting a hold of them was almost impossible. The bed was very uncomfortable, I could hardly sleep at all on them and when i did it was only because the noise from downstairs has quietened down a little.

 Let me say up front that my food was great, so the missing two stars have little to do with that. Pacific Ring (did they mean Pacific Rim?) is an attempt to do Japanese and Chinese simultaneously, with some Thai thrown in for good measure. The bad news... Not the worst idea in the world, but as often happens with that strategy, the menu is way way way too long. It worries me when menus are that long at an independently-owned operation like this because the odds that the hundreds of ingredients necessary to cover all the dishes are fresh and at their best every day, are slim to none. As a vegetarian, I'm slightly less concerned since I'm not spending top dollar on what may not be the freshest fish or beef or chicken. But I still care about my carnivorous friends :-) Also, while some of the Japanese salads and noodle dishes seem fine, they're attempting sushi too, which makes little sense. If I want to consume raw fish, I'm going to go somewhere which sole laser-like focus is on the preparation of raw fish. Especially if I'm in an inland city like Pittsburgh. At Pacific Ring, sushi seems completely out of place. Like the menu, the place is just too big. Granted, I ate there on a Tuesday evening during Pittsburgh's worst snowfall in decades. But restaurants are always going to have more slow-going weekday evenings, and it's just not good advertising to be serving diners in a huge, fairly empty restaurant. Better to err on the side of small and pack them in every night, I think. The good news... My ma po tofu was excellent. Without requesting it, my tofu was steamed, not fried. Very little grease in either that or my hot & sour soup. There is likely some MSG here, but I'm sure they'd leave it out if asked. The waitstaff was prompt and friendly. Despite the size of the place, the design is pleasing and the lighting is good. Great location along the Murray strip in Squirrel Hill N. And the prices are, for the most part, very reasonable.

 A small store with a very grand vision. Like another Yelper said, when you walk into Les \ u00c9toffes you really sense that you are entering the store's world. The colors (black, rust, navy, cream), the layout, and the clothes themselves all go together. The feeling is warm and inviting, so you want to go explore all the pieces on display. I used to sell yarn and fabric, so I loved the different textures and materials on display, from a luxuriously dense knit sweater to an elegant silk blouse. The design of each item was trendy but approachable -- I am a jeans and t-shirt kinda lady but I saw things I would wear. So why didn't I come home with a whole new wardrobe? Price, of course, sigh. Les \ u00c9toffes is definitely a special-occasion boutique, and alas I was only sightseeing. While I was there, though, a young man was trying on shirts and mentioned that he was making his first L.E. purchase. It seemed like he'd been looking forward to that day for a while. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Quite possibly my favorite place in the entire United States. It's unfortunate it has to be in Pittsburgh, PA...but that's part of what makes it awesome in it's own way. I am giving this place the honor of my very first Yelp review even though I have not lived in Pittsburgh for more than a year. This place has amazing American pub food. The nachos are piled high with an indeterminable amount of good toppings. The buffalo wings (and other kinds of wings) are large, properly covered in sauce, and perfectly spicy. But the best food here are the pizzas. The Flying Buffalo, the Garden of Eden, et. al. No matter what mood you are in, there's an awesome personal pizza to be had. As if the food wasn't enough, they have probably the best (not the largest - the best) beer selection in Pittsburgh. House brews and Great Lakes (from Cleveland), Guinness, Yeungling, all on tap. More than 50 others in bottles. At decent prices too! Almost all food is half-off after 11PM every night - which is key. On Saturdays, the ""house blues man"" Don Sjzeck, plays his awesome mix of Johnny Cash, Greatful Dead, blues, and rock covers as well as his fun sing-along original stuff. It made every Saturday night awesome for me. Hangover Breakfast on Sunday mornings is great for its stated purpose. Unlimited coffee, bloody marys, etc. Do what you need to do and go there one night. It's worth it and its an awesome Pittsburgh experience. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Such a shame. This place used to be my local when I lived in Tollcross and I rather enjoyed the unpretentious old man's pub atmosphere. Easily a 4-star for me. So I thought... I went with my flatmate the other day, both regulars. We went after the kitchen was closed (9pm) and were hungry, so basically at some point I went to the takeaway across the road, under the soaking rain, to get some chips for my flatmate and I. She stayed inside with our common friend because our pints were still full. Well... guess what? They politely chucked us out. ""- Sorry, no takeaway food in here - But your kitchen is closed. - Sorry you just can't - How come? - Well it stinks..."" For a place serving fish & chips and pork cheeks, I thought the ""stinky"" was a bit cheeky. The policy isn't clearly displayed and the reasons invoked were utter rubbish. We ate out, under the rain, with the smokers, and went back in to finish our drinks. Considering other places - that also operate a kitchen - never bothered us with that (Cuckoo's Nest for instance), well Cloister's Bar now seems slightly more pretentious than it appears, and I probably won't spend as much time and money as I used to.

 Odd Happy Hour. Terrible food. The only time in my life I've ever seen a group order chicken wings and not finish them. I mean, that's saying something isn't it? Two stars because they have Guinness on tap and it's a convenient location so I always seem to end up there when I am in Tempe, even though it's not very good. Note to self: beer only next time.

 Pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect much bc of the appearance of the front, but the food was good, the portions were generous and the price was just right. One word of advice, if eating in and you don't plan on using chopsticks, being your own silverware. They only provide flimsy forks that beak when any pressure is applied. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Excellent! I haven't been to a Red Lobster in literally YEARS!! We had recently ate at a ""high end"" sea food place in town, with an unbalanced product:value ratio. Red Lobster was a refreshing surprise at a fraction of the price. GF had a gift card, so we popped in during Lobster Fest. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING was great!! We were quoted 45 minutes for a table and were seated in 20. Every point of contact was polite, but casual. The biscuits are everything I was promised, the specialty cocktails are delightful, and specials really covered all tastes. I got two, perfectly cocked and wonderfully seasoned lobster tails. GF had the Surf & Turf which she said was great, but wouldn't let me taste, as she was too excited to eat it herself. (j/k, she reads these) If I had to lodge a complaint: The water in the bathroom sink gets hot too fast. We had an very good mean, with great service, for literally 1/3 of what we paid at a fine dining, sea food specific establishment (see next review). ",0,0,0,1,0

 I appreciate the attention to detail that Osso put into the decorations at the restaurant. It's absolutely beautiful inside. However, the food and service here just didn't do it for me. My friend was visiting from out of town and we stopped here for dinner and drinks. We arrived pretty early and there were plenty of open tables but apparently you need a reservation to get a table...no problem so we just sat at the bar. The drink menu is not extensive but they have a full bar and a decent selection of martinis. I ordered the Bikini Martini. It was good, not great. It's a mix of pineapple, coconut and grenadine...sounds super yummy. But it was not...(that's just my opinion) I finished it but I would not order it again. For the meal, I went with the chicken, spinach and mascarpone ravioli. I ordered the small portion thinking it would be more than enough but I was mistaken. The plate came out with three pieces of ravioli in the parmesan cream sauce sauce. I didn't enjoy it. And I was really underwhelmed with the presentation and after a few bites it was back to Yelp to search for another spot to eat because I was still really hungry. Also the service was lacking. It wasn't that busy but after we ordered there were a few other guest that came in and ordered and got their food before we did...what's up with that?!? As we were wrapping up we felt rushed along...apparently there was an event there later that evening that they were setting up for...So it just seemed like we were in the way. Ugh. All in all, for the price and location I expected better. I'm not sure I'd go back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Nestled near Paramount's Carowinds, we figured we would stop in for a bite to eat. As we neared, we saw signs advertising that kids eat free, which is always a bonus. As we got in, we found out that actually two kids eat free with each adult entree. If, however, kids eat off the buffet, they get a discounted buffet with each adult buffet. Which is a little odd, but whatever. Sunday, at least, has a brunch buffet, which includes not only pizza, but several types of pasta, multiple meats, mussels, a nice salad bar, and a pretty good selection of breakfast-type foods as well. The food isn't bad, but is fairly mundane - nothing really stands out. The service started off okay, but it went downhill fast. Oftentimes glasses stood empty, food (for those who ordered entrees) arrived one at a time rather than altogether, and there was general disarray. The outside of the place looked like they opened recently, so it may be that they are having growing pains - but since we aren't often in the area, I'm not sure if we'll give it another chance. If we do, I'll update the rating accordingly. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We held a lunch meeting at a local engineer's office today and like to support local business. We looked on Yelp and some other sites and Urban Picnic came up. Initially, the ordering was difficult because new owners recently took over and were in the process of setting up a new web site. Young Eli came to the rescue and we placed our order for 15 meals with sides including nine sandwiches and six salads. We were somewhat anxious as we always are with new places but once we got to the deli and met the owners, we knew it would turn out. Using Boars Head provisions, it had to be decent but once we got to the meeting and heard nothing but praises from our clients, all turned out well. The sandwiches were savored and the salads looked full and tasty and everyone enjoyed their meal. Please give this place a try and you won't be disappointed. PS They deliver to businesses around Mesa. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ok - so I like the feel of this place, but overall quality is just ok. It is a good place to get a hot dog and some tater tots. Who does not love tater tots? The location is a bit off, just tucked into a semi-residential/strip mall area. I love tater tots and I love that when I get my food here it is hot and delicious. I wish they had more of a variety but this is a chain after all. If you sign up for emails, you always get notifications of coupon and deals. They have special everyday and happy hours for appetizers. Try it out for a quit meal when you are out and about. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I was starving and since it was 10 pm my options were limited so I decided to give this place try since it was close by. First of all the place is small and was uninviting. Sat down and was never asked if i wanted anything to drink so I ordered a roll. So finally fed up I asked the sushi chef for some water. My first roll was the Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll it was mediocre at best the tuna was very mushy. Then orderd fried tofu which was ok, and also ordered the yellowtail which was ok, spicy tuna which again mushy and the california roll which was ok waiter gave me the check while I was still eating didnt ask If i wanted anything else (not like I would of ordered anything else after all the dissapoinments) Had to ask for a water refill otherwise they would have dried me out! Left most of what I ordered at the table. I was asked if everything was ok by 4 different people 8 times I dont know if thats good or bad! Didnt feel comfortable,felt rushed and I just wanted to leave. So after all the dissapointments I had to cheer up somehow so I went across the street for a sure thing got some mango crepes which made my night! I would definetley not go there again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 You come to Edinburgh and don't come here if you are a tourist? If you grew up here you probably came here once when you were a kid avoided the place because it is full of tourist. But since I was visiting as a tourist I came to check this place out. The Castle dominates the surrounding area with great views of the city, it is a little pricey to get in but I think it has a number of well curated museums if you are into history and in particular military history. There are the rolls for a number of wars/battles for the fallen, and each of the Scottish Military Regiments have their Regimental museums here too. The are aplenty so bring a camera with lots of memory, a jacket and a bottle of water. ",0,0,0,0,1

 The bagels here are overpriced and mediocre. But, it's in the neighborhood so we stop by occasionally due to proximity. The bagels are essentially round bread instead of bagels. They do seem to provide some community activities. A large banner outside advertises chess for kids every Friday evening. So, I appreciate that. Brooklyn Bagel Deli is there when you want bagels and aren't too finicky about the quality. It's along the lines of Big Apple Bagels and other equivalent pseudo-bagel joints. But, my experiences have been that staff is friendly and well, it's better than nothing when the lazy-weekend bagel craving hits. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This hotel is very affordable so it is perfect for college students or people traveling on a low budget. The room is very spacious which is a plus. However, it was a non-smoker room and smelt like people have recently been smoking in there. The carpet is really dirty (and at some places wet for no reason) so I would not suggest walking there barefoot at all. The room is also very dusty. I always woke up with tearing eyes and a congested nose. The bathroom was big and clean, so were the towels. The room didn't have a fridge or minibar (in case you are thinking to bring some food, it will go bad). We also always had problems to get into our room as our keys didn't work well and we had to go get new keys a few times. Furthermore, the check-in took forever as there was a long line and only a few ppl working. Every time I passed the lobby there was always a long line. My check-in took me over half an hour. Overall the hotel is nice as it has lots to offer. Many little stores, restaurant inside. It also has roller coasters inside as well as free trapez shows. It is also kinda far off the main part of Las Vegas Blvd which was annoying as you have to walk a lot. However, if you simply look for a cheap and safe place to stay in Vegas and not too far away from the strip, this is a good place to be. If you look for something more comfortable I suggest you To take a different hotel. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I got a massage and pedicure from Spa Mio and it was a lovely experience. I was given a tour of the spa and was very impressed! I am not a prude by any means, but you will find women who are 100% comfortable with their bodies, just an FYI. I was just taken aback because I have only been to spas where people walk around in robes, keeping covered up while changing, etc. I wish more women would be comfy with their bodies rather then resort to cosmetic surgery or covering up their bodies. Anyway, it was very relaxing and the water they have is so awesome. It is infused with flavors and I must have downed 5 gallons while I was there. My massage was pretty good, which is why I gave this place a 4 star rating. I have had better but like I said, it was pretty good. My pedicure was awesome, very relaxing and the technician was super sweet. The showers were awesome, i must have stayed in there for close to an hour!

 It is very difficult for me to admit that a steakhouse is bad, but this one wins. We stayed for 2 hours and they only served 2 types of meat (90% of the time the same one). First of all GAS grill is an assassin of the ""brazilian barbecue"", that's why all tasted really bad. No papaya cream for desert is another indicator that this is not from Brazil . And to close , no espresso, definitely not from Brazil. You got the second start only because of the potato salad and the farofa which were very good. This is so brazilian as Panda Express is chinese. ",0,1,0,0,0

 In the interest of full disclosure, I have to say that I used to come here all the time when it was Ye Olde Sandwich Shoppe. The service was fun and fast, the house was virtually untouched from the 1920s down to the extent of the old TV sets and the creaky wood floors, and they had absolutely the BEST SOUPS in town! Well, they lost their lease and then this lady Lisa G. moves in. Next think you know, the fabulous, funky 1920s bungalow has had its heart ripped out in favor of MODERN DECOR [yecch!!!]-so I really have to ask Ms. G ""why didn't you go find some new digs if you wanted modern decor?"" I HATE it when people rip out the fabulous old wood floors and plaster and put in drywall!!! That said--the food is good [kind of modern fusion], I've only been there twice for lunch so I can't say how dinner is, and since I've only been there for lunch I can't say if the wine list is any good. Perhaps I'll be back for dinner--if hubby and I can take seeing what's been done to one of our favorite lunch hangouts, that is. And the soup? Sorry, I'd rather go back to Ye Olde Sandwich Shoppe in its dreary industrial setting over at 31st Ave. and Thomas and get their fabulous soups. Not there's anything wrong with Lisa G's soups, but the Sandwich Shoppe ladies have everybody beat. So--food rates a 3.5, ambiance a 1.5 for tearing out the funkiness of yet another one of our dwindling number of historic homes. But all you yuppie urban types out there are gonna be happy campers, so go have a great time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I asked a business near Chang Lee's if they would recommend their food, and everyone said yes. I was greeted immediately upon entering Chang Lee's by two less than enthusiastic waitresses. I ordered take out (sweet & sour pork, fried rice, and a coke). While waiting in the lobby, I noticed several displeasing things. There was a half full coffee carafe in a soda/water mini fridge, their fish tank had scum all over the inside with little foliage or rock (these help de-stress fish), and their TV was set to Unsolved Mysteries--not exactly an appetizing show. I received my food and headed back to work. The soda tasted...dirty. I don't know how it is possible, but my Coca Cola in a Styrofoam cup tasted as if there were dust or dirt in it. I couldn't even choke it down. The pork wasn't bad, good flavor, but very fatty. The rice was nothing special, just a filler by far. Hardly any veggies or egg included in it. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have driven down Queens Rd several times and never noticed Theatre Charlotte so I was excited when my roomie scored some tickets to see Doubt: A Parable there. The building is quite old, we were told that the theater has operated there for 71 years! The dress is casual, I felt a bit overdressed in my pencil skirt. We were greeted warmly by the staff upon arrival and were able to get a nice malbec for about $4. Be warned, this is a cash only venue...with no atm in the building. We sauntered on to the front row (hey these are the best seats in the house!) and enjoyed the performance. The actress who played Sister Aloysius stood out among the three person cast. Let's just say if you can play a part that Meryl Streep took on and make it look every bit as fabulous you've got talent!

 Ok Ok Ok...I said in my last review that I would never go back. I lied. Met some friends there that actually frequent the place. They knew the servers, which made the experience a little bit better. While waiting for my friend's husband to show up, we shared the calamari. Yes folks, this was not fresh calamari...but you know what? Who cares! First off, I am in AZ...second, wherever it came from....it was was good! We were going to order the spinach and artichoke dip, but our server informed us that ladies get $$$ off the brushetta. I wasn't thrilled with the Traditional Brushetta....felt like it was was missing something. The Caprese was excellent, but the Artichoke was by far the best. I could have ordered more if I had to. The wine list is extensive, and I promise the next time I go I will get some.

 It's good for both groups as well as for a couple of friends, and fairly priced too. The food here I have found to be consistently good. It's not overly greasy as most Americanized Chinese food joints are, and I love coming here on a cold day for a big bowl of beef-noodle-stew. Remember that whole curse about this location? How a restaurant had never been able to last there for more than a year? Well, Lai Lai definitely proved everyone wrong and is still going strong. They're pretty hands-off here. If you would like more tea or water, get up and get it yourself! If you're in a rush to pay the check, walk it up to the front and get it rung up.

 (I just want to start by noting that I'm NOT a homophobe. I've lived in the SF Bay Area for many years. I have many gay friends. My profession lends itself to working with many gay peeps daily. I'm a gleek & have seen every episode of Glee, and I recently LMAO while watching ""Br \ u00fcno."" Being gay doesn't bother me or affect me). With that being said, I knew that the theme of this show was that of a dream. No one told me that it was a WET GAY DREAM! It was a dude fest with only a hand full of ladies (mostly synchronize swimmers) who are only background players, 3 ballroom dancers, 3 trapeze, and the lead. The rest were bald muscle men wearing tights or diapers, straight out of a Right Said Fred video. I just wanted to see a balance, that's all. So don't write me up or send complaints. okay? I can understand that this show requires a lot of upper body strength so more dudes were needed, but C'mon! Look at all the fellow Yelpers' ratings. Most of the good reviews came from WOMEN, not card carrying members of the Y chromosome. The circular stage (not a bad seat in the house) and all the technical aspects were really amazing. The uncertainty added by the viscosity of the water on all the players while holding each other up high above the water added suspense. The visuals and the music were pretty good, but I was really disappointed that the musicians were hidden behind a cage. (I'm trying not to compare this with Cirque, but as a musician I have to point this out). What I love about Cirque is that they incorporate the musicians into the show and they're out in the open to see, even in costume. The music is part of the live creation of the show. There's really no story. When the bed came down in the end, I heard a lot of suppressed giggles (like jr. high kids during sex ed). My friend scored free tickets so I didn't pay the $140 asking price. I really wanted to like this show so I could return with my wife or visiting family, but I really can't justify the price to watch this again. I am glad that I did get to see it though for free. It was entertaining with difficult and impressive visuals, which in the end was the whole purpose, right? ",0,0,1,0,0

 The best homemade tortillas in Scottsdale!! Located in a historic adobe home in Old Town Scottsdale.

 I just started at this school and I absolutely love it! Everyone there is so warm and friendly and the instructors are amazing. The building in itself is beautiful. Everything is so clean and modern, and of course with the Aveda products the school smells wonderful! If you are looking to go to get into a cosmetology program I highly recommend checking out the Aveda institute you won't be disappointed! ",0,0,0,0,1

 This is my favorite restaurant. Their food is unique and tasty (try the rib eye philly). There is always a huge crowd, so it can be loud, but it is the place to be! Of course all their beer is good. The unique environment with the old bank vault being the manager's office (near the bathrooms), and the safe deposit boxes as part of the lobby seating give this place personality! Not the best happy hour prices, but the food is good! We like the live music when it is there! For an appetizer, try the Ciltantro Lime Hummus - sometimes my wife orders this as her meal! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Decided to give Planet Hollywood a try based on a recommendation from a friend. I'd have to say, apart from the Miracle Mile and Koi Japanese Steakhouse, this hotel really didn't wow me. I had a lot of hope for this hotel but it fell short of meeting my expectations. I thought the room was going to be modern, sleek and decked out with cool movie memorablia. Our movie items consisted of a shirt and a poster from the Murder in the First movie. The bathroom is outdated and the fixtures need replacement. Had to run the shower water for 5 minutes prior to getting in or the water was freezing. Plus side, the tub is huge and jetted. The bed is comfortable and my room overlooked the pool. Shops, restaurants, pools and shows right at your fingertips. Right across the street and adjacent to hotel are many options for shopping, gambling, shows and food. Great location but the room is not up to other Las Vegas 4-star hotel standards. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Its been 8 months since I've been to Lucille's and the great customer experience I experienced my first trip appear to be a thing of the past. I was expecting to wait 30 to 40 minutes so having to wait 55 minutes wasn't really an issue for me. However it did allow me to witness an employee picking cigarette butts out of an ashtray with his bare hands. I'm sure he washed hands when he went inside but he had to open the door with his bare hands and god knows what else he touched between the door and the faucet. Once we were finally seated our server disappeared for 15 minutes and I had to flag down someone different in order to place a drink order. When our server finally arrived we placed an order for an appetizer. It was delivered by a third person who threw the plate on our table and it slid across almost to the wall she announced fried green tomatoes and walked away. No Silverware, no napkins so I got up and hunted down our server asked for some to be brought over so we could eat our tomatoes. Was told sorry we ran out. How does a properly managed restaurant run out of Silverware? (It doesn't) the Server sent someone over with some silverware but it was given to the booth behind us who didn't have any food on their table! So we have been there more than an hour an a half didn't have silverware and we didn't have drinks. Once our silverware arrived the tomatoes were a little bland but the sauce made up for the lack of flavor in them. When We finally got around to place an order I asked for an extra corn bread muffin and a side of Mac and Cheese these are both on the of side order menu and should not have been too difficult but I had to ask twice for them to get delivered so I could eat them with my meal. The manager did come over and apologized for our experience and offered to take some of the items off our bill but when the bill arrived everything was still on it. I considered calling him over and pointing that out but figured it would be easier just to pay for everything and call it a night. It may just be another 8 months till I come back for that delicious Blacken Catfish but I will be back eventually once the memory of last night fades away. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Located in the Fremont hotel and casino, this place is tucked behind the Tony Roma's. The entrance is so plain and small, you could easily walk past it. There are about 20 tables inside and it's darkly lit. We had the stuffed pork chops, the T-Bone Steak and Salmon Florentine with Gorgonzola. The pork chop was presented well, but over cooked. It was dry and tough. I had the Salmon which was good and flaky. The combination of Gorgonzola and the red pepper sauce was good. The T-Bone steak was meh. ",0,0,1,0,0

 If you are looking for a ""quite"" or romantic dinner, Hofbrauhaus is definitely not the right spot for you. The food is not the main reason to drag anyone to the restaurant either. However, Bavaria is not known for its culinary. Don't get me wrong, the place is a unique experience: Loud music, Good beer and - if u are lucky, like I was - there will be a few groups of germans standing on the tables while singing and dancing and you could also share one of the big tables with friendly, talkative bavarian folks. When it comes to the food: try the brats. The variety is not vast, but they are tasty and a good side of Germany. And the pretzels worth the try too. Don't forget the mustard and the obazda sauce. The service is not the strongest point: it took over 10 minutes to be greeted by anyone, another 10 minutes to get our beer and about half and hour to get the food. The wait wasn't bothering me much while my 1 liter beer was full and I was enjoining the music and the german bachelor party group next table, but then a sad thing happen: no one asked to refill our beers for the next hour, and when the server did, it took a while to come. Don't get scared when the bill comes. Just the pretzel itself is about $ 12, the beer $ 15... so... expect to spend from $50-$100 a person. FINAL SCORE: FOOD: 3 stars SERVICE: 3 stars AMBIENCE: 5 star ",0,0,0,1,0

 It is ten after seven on a Sunday night and all I can think about is that big fat Gobblerito sitting there waiting for me at Mad Mex. When I tried it I ordered it out of morbid curiosity. Thanksgiving dinner in a burrito?! Really?! WHY AREN'T YOU IN MY FACE?! I didn't have very high expectations for it. I figured lunch meat variety turkey, instant mashed potatoes, and some cheap stuffing and canned veggies. I couldn't have been more wrong. This food is the tops. I'm completely serious. The food was fresh and home cooked. It comes with a side of cranberry sauce and once you eat it (that is if you can finish it, THIS THING IS HUGE) it continues to haunt you. I can not wait to go back for another one before it disappears until next year. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My boyfriend and I stayed there for 4 nights in the Masquerade Tower (older one). The room was HUGE compared to what I'd seen in other hotels and it felt like a studio apartment. The shower looked pretty outdated and the water didn't drain very well... there was a small pool of water. There's a vanity area with an extra sink which is nice if someone's using the bathroom. On the last night of our stay, the water took a lot longer than usual to heat up. The bed was so-so; it felt more bouncy than comfy. I saw a few holes in the sheets... not very impressive. After a long day of activities we decided to order room service because we didn't want to go around and look for food, but we were told that it would be an HOUR wait... so we went to the All-American Cafe. The service was horrible. Our waitress disappeared after she brought out our food. Our water never got refilled... when she finally returned, we had to ask for more water. When she came back to fill our glasses, it took forever for her to come back again with our check. Meanwhile, there were at least 3 other groups of people who came and went... Too bad we didn't have that waiter. I liked the Carnival World Buffet. It's supposed to be the largest buffet on the strip, but doesn't seem that big. The food was pretty good considering that most of it had probably been sitting out for a while. The shuttle to the sister hotels was convenient since Rio is off the strip. ALL SUMMED UP:: I'd probably go back but request a room in the newer tower. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This was my first time getting a Brazilian done. The woman who did mine was very friendly and answered all my questions and concerns. She was very professional and considerate. She also asked me several times if I was still doing OK and let me know we could take a break if I needed to. The process took about twenty minutes and although it's painful (not as bad as I imagined) it is completely worth it ladies! Your husbands will love you! They offer your first wax at $20 and then I believe it goes up to $35. My only dislike was the fact that their ingrown hair serum was $20 for me to purchase. I have very sensitive skin and I get razor bumps/ingrown hairs a lot so if this serum does work I will be very happy but it's still a little on the pricey side. The woman at the front desk said it should last 4 months so maybe it's worth it. We will see! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Stopped in for breakfast with the girls. I've been before for meals for happy hour and dinner but never breakfast. We had small children with us and the outdoor patio was a great option, no problem with including the kids in the fun! The breakfast itself was amazing! I got an order of French toast with eggs. The eggs were fake eggs but did not need salt or pepper it was really delicious. The French toast on the other hand was EPIC. The ""sauce"" of the plate was the syrup and was garnished with blueberries. It was simple but so delicious and the presentation was beautiful. The ladies said their mimosas were also great and a strongly suggested beverage for the drinking diners! One thing, we had a group of about 6 and it was not offered to split the bill and the waiter definitely struggled with keeping separate multiple cash paying customers. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I used to come to Chicken Bonz when it was Chicken Bonz every Friday night and get take out. 10 fingers lemon pepper with their tasty dipping sauces and ranch. Since it has changed to Meat, Chix and Weiners, we have dined here 3 times. The awesome girl at the counter who has always helped me said everything will stay the same and the owner just didn't want to pay the franchising fee anymore. That would be false. Everything has changed. First off, the prices have increased. The price for what used to be a 10 piece is now an 8 piece. The quality of the chicken has also changed. You know how when you buy frozen chicken tenders at the grocery store, they're all identical in shape and size? Oddly enough, so are the fingers served at MCW. They didn't used to be clones of one another, so strike one. Secondly, the name is just disgusting. I had to tell my children that they're not allowed to say the name of this establishment anymore & just call it chicken bonz. It's funny to the middle school crowd, I suppose, but not appropriate for people with small children or those that respect themselves enough to not eat a place with such a dumb name. Third, they took away all the perks that made this place worth coming to. Kids eating free with purchase & AYCE wings every day have now changed to kids don't eat free, infact, they're watching Family Guy (which I wouldn't ever let my children even listen to) in the store, and there's only AYCE wings for an extra dollar than before on Tuesday only. When I was there once, two guys walked out after reading they don't have AYCE anymore and that it would be too pricey. Lastly, the salad bar is disgusting. You can get AYCE salad for a cheap price, but it's gross. The lettuce is old and limp when I went at 2PM, they're too cheap to buy cherry tomatoes & instead just cut up a Roma, they have dry dry dried out baby carrots, and canned sliced black olives. It is a weird canvas to make a salad out of. Do NOT expect sweet tomato variety here. It's not even close. Just imagine someone strolling through the canned food aisle, grabbing random crap, and throwing it right onto your plate! The owner was sick of paying the franchising fee but every time I have gone back since they've changed, it has been completely DEAD. So unfortunately, since he was too cheap to pay the franchising fee, he now has no business at all. What's worse? He has turned what used to be a family restaurant my friends & I enjoyed bringing our children to dine at is now the complete opposite serving frozen chicken with limp salads. I guess I'll drive a little bit further to Raisin' Canes (which I never used to eat at when Chicken Bonz was open. I happily paid more for quality). ",0,1,0,0,0

 Looking for a new breakfast place we decided to try Park Cafe. Sunday at 11 is a hard time to find a place to eat without a wait. We had no problem walking right in to the Cafe. We were one of only 3 occupied tables. The breakfast menu was really small but the offerings were tasty. He had the sloppy southwest omelet and I had the Hawaiian bread French toast and side of bacon. The only real reason I gave this place 3 stars and not 4 is simple. The chairs. If you have any girth to you at all these chairs are simply uncomfortable. Maybe when it's a bit warmer out the patio would offer better seating. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I was excited to try this place after living in the area for a few months, but I was unfortunately left disappointed. The pros: friendly staff, flavorful salsas (ask to try the habanero sauce!) and the queso was delish. The cons: the burrito was incredibly bland. It seemed like most of it was rice and beans, which would be ok if they had actually put the time into seasoning those components. The best part if the burrito was that I put salsa on it. Without that, it would've tasted of nothing. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Not bad food and I like the atmosphere of eating in the middle of the Forum Shops. A little expensive for what you get (but I suppose that's an apt description of a lot of Las Vegas restaurants). Our waiter was good, and even pointed out that a dish I initially ordered wasn't their best. It seemed a little odd at the time to have a waiter bad-mouth a dish, but I appreciated the honesty and ordered something else. While there are many other places to go in Vegas that I would recommend this was a good choice since we didn't have reservations anywhere else that night. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I heard so much good stuff about this place. So finally, with friends in town for a weekend in August and we decided to hit up this place. Got a promoter to add us to the guestlist and thought that was badass. Got there and found out guestlist meant nothing. There is pretty much nowhere to sit and put your stuff if you don't have a daybed But there was open bar for females from 1p-3p. So we called up a friend and ended up getting a daybed. So that was nice. It was right in front of the pool. And the pool was quite small and filled with dudes, and not very good looking ones that day. Bummer. Overall, not that great. Perhaps my expectations were too high? But the pool was small and crowded, and if you want a place to sit, you need to get a bed or cabana. The music was not that great either. I'd rather take the walk over to Azure. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have to agree with Gregory A's review. This office is ALWAYS trying to sell me on something. My teeth are pretty straight but they keep calling me asking if I'm ready for my braces, and every time I go in they add on additional services that I don't need. I constantly have to remind them that I did x-rays the last time and don't need them again or some other crazy stuff. The office is nice and clean, the people are friendly, and the services have been high enough quality, but it freaks me out that they are more focused on selling me unnecessary services than simply keeping me healthy like doctors/dentists should be. I don't trust them to give me an honest assessment of my dental needs that's for sure. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Saw the show in mid December, it was our 2nd time to see it. Fantastic guitar playing and singing. While the showroom at the Tropicana is a nice venue, it is not conducive for a show like this. This show screams for people to be up on their feet, but ones sitting close to the stage are seated in booths and tables. It's a pain in the ass to slide out and rock out. The first time we saw this was at the Las Vegas Hilton or whatever it's called now and it had just regular seats that was easy to stand up and watch great guitar playing by Doug Aldrich and Howard Leece. This will be a show we will see every time we visit las vegas. 5 stars for the music, but maybe 3 stars for the theater. Just rip out the tables and booths for a mosh pit area and it will be perfect.

 The checkin system crazy. Don't mind a wait for a good place to eat, but being told to just hover around and check back every 20 minutes is interesting. Invest in the pager system. After hovering around the hostess station for about a half and hour we were seated. It took almost 10 minutes before our waiter acknowledged us. By this time we knew exactly what we wanted and just ordered at the same time we asked for water. Water took almost another 10 minutes and we then had to ask another bus boy? waiter? to get it for us. When another couple was seated in our area, I timed it from sit down to when he first approached them and it mirrored our experience. So this was obviously a very poor waiter who needs to either be re-trained or doing something else. The bread and butter to came out with meal. We ordered the burgers to try. They were good, but not anything to make me want to endure their check-in system and poor service for. We had eaten burgers at Mon Ami Gabi the day before and they were much better and we had A+ service. Not to mention the price at Mesa was no deal. I'll pay a lot for a good burger, but not when there is crappy service, forget it. Our waiter basically ignored us until near the end of our meal. Then he came back about every minute to try and ""be our friend"". I get that whole recency effect. He figures we will give him a tip based on that. Wrong. I would never come back to the Mesa Grill. With so many other great places to eat in Vegas with top-notch service, I would rather take my money and time there. ",0,1,0,0,0

 What better place for a haven of vinyl than Plaza Midwood? Pardon, not just vinyl, but a great selection of new, old, classic, and unknowns that have been newly refound, used and delivered anew to this glorious establishment. I used to be a big CD buyer and this place has always been a treasure trove for what I was/am in the market for and wasn't in the market for.I love that you can always find something you didn't know you wanted until you saw it here. So many of my favorite bands tend to release vinyl editions of past records and I love that I can find them here. They always have box sets, too, which can be hard to find elsewhere, other than the internet. I've come in on a weekday and just perused for hours and had conversations with the owner about shows, new records, turntables and other things. He's a cool dude. They've been known to have some shows here, too. Usually something local, but still fun. It's a squirrely little shop with no real allocated parking lot. Take heed to some of the spots in the surrounding shopping areas as you may come back to your vehicle with with a nice, shiny boot on one of the front wheels. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This store has gotten better. I am sometimes tempted to head over to Home Depot, but in general this store is OK. Now, as far as why I gave them only two stars, here is where they really really drop the ball. They do not have an actual cashier in the evenings. They only have those self service machines which is four machines managed by 1 cashier. I get it Lowes, you make MORE $$ when you give less service. (At least that is what YOU think).

 This store is too busy. Don't get me wrong, I love my Mac more than anything but the service at this store is god-awful. Luckily before purchasing my Mac I researched until I knew exactly what I wanted. I seemed to know more than the associate that helped me! Purchasing it was more of an awkward affair - I couldn't wait to get out of there. Also, it's always almost impossible to get into the Genius Bar. My iPod malfunctioned sometime earlier this year and after waiting in the store for 45 minutes to be seen, I was only informed that the damages were more in depth than they thought and I would need to schedule an appointment. It's just an iPod, people! The experience itself was more than frustrating. I stick with Amazon on this one. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Ok I've had the shawarma and the stuffed grape leaves (vegetarian). The Shawarma was excellent and the stuffed grape leaves were very tasty. So Will I be going back again you ask....NO! This place is only open M-F 11-5pm when most of us are at work. And don't even think about sneaking up on the weekends because they are closed on Sat & Sun. The only reason that I was able to enjoy anything from this place is that I took my birthday off from work and just so happened to walk-in and give this place a try. I'm thinking there may be a correlation between the business hours and the number of reviews. Anyhow if you are a student or work in Oakland do not miss this place! I however, will have to look elsewhere:( ",0,0,1,0,0

 Great New Mexican food. The house made chips are worth the visit. The chile con queso tastes just like my mom's. Unfortunately everything we got with the exception of the beans and rice was too spicy for my lovely lady. A margarita would have been great but they don't serve alcohol. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Oh my, my taste buds were going all crazy after eating at Yusho. The food is so good that my mouth is watering as I reminisce on the whole experience; sorry I didn't take a lot of pictures my phone was low on juice. It suppose to be street food so it seems simple but I'd only caution everyone else that the food aint cheap. The first item up was the Chicken Drummies http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yusho-las-vegas-2?select=UioPVMGCzrAhEBhmwxoDCQ#jVJY592-J_LNB9vucVuFHg these were definitely not your usual chicken drummies. At least for $9 they better have not been my usual ones. There was I think 5 or 6 fried crispy pieces in red miso, garlic, and sesame, small yes but delicious. I kind of wished I had more. The next item was the Pork Shoulder Steam Buns http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yusho-las-vegas-2?select=UioPVMGCzrAhEBhmwxoDCQ#7h3L67sTasIEWUrHlf_J2A It was a juicy piece of pork shoulder with their kim chi, some cilantro, and other things on a white steam bun. It had a lot of flavor. Again it was a little small for me but tasty. Next was the Fried Duck Leg it's crispy on the outside juicy and tender on the inside, delicious. It was served with a plum BBQ sauce, some herbs, and a couple white steam buns. I love duck and loved this dish. It was probably the simplest to make dish I had. I don't remember the rest of the items just the picked oshinko cucumbers, lotus root, and carrot salad. I also liked for being veggies. The rest of the menu is pretty much grilled items (tofu steaks, NY aged strip steak, shishito peppers, etc.), fried items (more fried chicken, veggie tempura, maitake mushroom, etc), noodles, steam buns, pickeled, and sweet items (I heard about the doughnut made from tofu, sweet potato, and rosemary it sound good I forgot to try some, another time). The customer service was excellent. The interior is nice and spacious. Good selection of alcoholic beverages, from beers, cocktails, sakes, and wines. It's located in the Monte Carlo near the front, towards the Strip and can be easily access by walking through the casino or Strip. I'd definitely be back just don't know when. I forgot to add that they also had these fried skin, served like chips so good. ",0,0,0,1,0

 It's called Monkey Bar, it really lives up to the name, you see monkey decorations and paintings everywhere, they were fun to look at, I like monkeys! It's a good sized bar and lounge facing front desk, dim and dark, the booth seatings are very intimate and comfy, perfect for couples, the tall table seatings are great for groups, the bar seatings are obviously good for singles meeting singles, I saw many people met, talked and left together, it was interesting to watch. We went there on all three nights we stayed at the SLS hotel. This bar is located on the way to our Lux tower, so I took the advantage to have drinks before going out each night, it seemed convenient. We briefly enjoyed the lounge time while the live music was playing, I liked the piano play and singing during the day much better, the rock n' roll music on Friday and Saturday night was a bit too loud for me, but it was very lively and energetic, it's for weekends! It got very crowded on early Friday and Saturday nights, slow on Saturday late night and very slow on Sunday night, there was no live music on Sunday night either, but I enjoyed the quieter times much better like always. I tried two specialty cocktails on the menu, and decided to just stick to them, Jasmine's margarita and Passion for wine, both were very refreshing, tasty and not too strong with enough sweetness, they were perfect, got me very relaxed before or after our night out, great choices! Hubby had Vesper martini as usual, they charged different prices on Saturday and Sunday night, one was $18, one was $14, huh.... Different night or different bartender, different prices? That's interesting. The cocktail waitresses were very friendly and attentive, not to mention they were all eye candies too. I was surprised to see them wearing open toe shoes without stockings, never seen anything like that in Vegas, I guess SLS wanted to make everything edgy, hip and different. I would say this lounge was better for me on slow nights, the drinks were yummy, a bit pricey, $15-18, but it was to be expected, just don't charge different prices on the same drink, that was odd!

 I'm not the biggest fan of buffet. I find them kind of gross normally. Cravings was pretty good with a very large selection of food. We went for brunch, so all you can eat plus unlimited champagne or mimosas for $25 is pretty damn good. Our waitress was very attentive and accommodating. I would have given this place 3 stars if it hadn't been for the hostesses / cashiers at the front. We were a group of 12, but were just going to meet inside. Paid for our meals, went to be seated, and asked for a large table since we were a group. Mind you the place was empty given it was around 11am .... told no flat out. Then told we would have to pay extra for a group ... aren't you a buffet in a casino? And shouldn't you cater to groups? We noticed they were giving an elderly group of people the same treatment. Luckily our waitress just moved us and we were all able to sit together. Personally, I don't care about the extra $3 or $5 bucks, it was just the attitude of the hostess was completely out of line.

 I enjoyed dining here, I asked for my steak medium rare and the chef cooked it with a nice ruby middle. I am glad that he cooked it the right way because so many people mistake brown meat for a well cooked steak. If that was the case, then there would not be a need to pay so much for steak. Everything was delicious and we were seated next to a nice couple and other than the seating being slightly close to the other tables (hibachis), it was a good time. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Weak. I mean if you want a 'theme restaurant' worshipping Andrew Weil, you may love it. If you're looking for a healthy, organically-conscious restaurant with flavor, MEH, not so much. I spent a lot of money, heard a lot of talking about the food, but when the entrees hit the stage, I was thoroughly underwhelmed. They talked a big game, but when it came to what was important, the very thing I'd put up with rotten service as long as it's absolutely killer, the food, did not perform. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I finally got to try Moira yesterday, which I found via Yelp, and which I had bookmarked for months. I work in downtown Phx and really wanted to like it. The decor is pretty, and the building it's housed in is pretty awesome, but that's about as far as the positives go. Let me say first that the sushi isn't ""AWFUL""..... but it's not ""good"" either. It's meh. And it's definitely overpriced for ""meh."" (Compared to most places in Phoenix/Scottsdale/Tempe, it's at least $1 more per item.) I will say that the spicy tuna wasn't even remotely spicy. What sucks: the service. I went with a coworker for lunch, and we were not greeted, nor were we seated. We finally went to the bar, where a server came up to us after 10 minutes, only to tell us that she would be right back. The place was NOT busy at all. The server came back, took our drink orders, dropped them off, and that was it. We didn't see her for the rest of the meal and had to flag her down to get our check. I asked the sushi chef about lotus-- I wanted to know if it had a strong flavor. He thought about it for a minute and then said ""not really."" How about ""NOT AT ALL."" Which is fine-- they basically just use it for crunchy texture. It just struck me as odd that this wasn't his immediate response. Normally I wouldn't mention the chairs, but I have read other Yelp reviews and they are right-- they are the most uncomfortable chairs that my butt has graced in a long time. Bottom line is that if you are in downtown Phx and want reasonably good sushi for a good price, go to Ichi-Ban on Central and Thomas. The decor isn't as hip, but the food and service are FAR better.

 Overall : Solid hotel, good location, great breakfast, decent price. Nice, salt-water pool! A lot of other reviews of this place confuse me. It seems like they are describing a different hotel. Room : We had a king size bed business class room (free upgrade from what we booked). The room was a good size, two comfortable chairs, nice TV, strong wifi signal. Smallish shower, but not ludicrously so. Pretty nice - amazing view over the city Cleanliness : I am a clean freak. I hate staying in hotels and I strip the bed everywhere I go to look for bed bugs. The highest compliment I can give is that I generally had no complaints. The furniture was clean (and bug free) the bathrooms were clean, even the pool area was decent. Location : Right on the line between the Gay Village and Quartier des Spectacles, walking distance to several bars, and directly above the crossing of the orange and green (M1, M2) subway lines. Can't get any better than that! We always had places within walkable distance, we didn't have to go outside to get to the subway if we wanted to go further away, and we walked out the front door to see a free CIRCUS happening in the park across the street. Great location. Service : Friendly staff, very helpful. Cleaning crew was in and out quickly every day, concierge was super helpful, and the staff was always smiling when they greeted us. The two guys watching the pool clearly didn't care, but otherwise pretty great. Breakfast : Not technically a hotel only service, but included with our room, it was much better than any included hotel breakfast I've ever had. Lots of fresh fruit, eggs, bacon, sausage, decently good baked goods, several types of cereal, and actually good coffee. Worth mentioning because it made the stay just a little bit nicer, and gave us a nice kickstart to every morning. Price : After all the taxes, our room ended up being about $250 a night, which was a little more than we expected, but not terrible. Considering it was booked on 3 days notice, right in the middle of Warped Tour weekend, the Circus festival, and the Montreal Jazz Festival it wasn't a bad price. With the breakfast and great service, it didn't feel expensive. Other : A few other reviews mentioned the homeless people in the area. Yes. Get over it. There are a ton of parks around, Montreal is a BIG city, and homeless people are a reality. Nobody was aggressive or crazy towards us, mostly they left us alone. Even if they didn't, what the heck do you expect a hotel to do about the fact that homeless people exist in their city? Get real. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Holy cow, this place is extremely expensive!!! I spent over $14 on a small bag of candy. Yes, they do have a big selection of different candies but I don't think it's worth the price.

Yes, I love watermelon but I don't love watermelon enough to spend $14 on a bag of sugary candy when I can buy a real watermelon for $5.

 We have a daughter at U of A, but being crazy people, still have 5 kids at home. The daughter would like to come home to visit more than twice a year, but there was no way I was making the twice in a weekend 5 hour round trip from Buckeye no matter how much I love her. I worked it out and since my van gets about 17mpg, it costs me about $50 to drive from Sky Harbor to her dorm and back. Then I get to do it again 2-3 days later. The shuttle costs me $39 to drop her at the airport, saving me 5 hours of grief in the bargain. I saw the reviews were inconsistent, so I wanted to use the service a few times before posting. So far, my girl has come home twice with no issues, and I sent my high schooler to see her sister last month. They've experienced terrific service all three times. The drivers have been cheerful and helpful. The first time we used the service, there was a problem with the credit card and the website, but the driver took care of it quickly at the next stop, and they still got into Sky Harbor early. When asked, the driver gives her a heads up when they are about 30 minutes from the airport so she can text me to meet her. Shrug. I don't understand the complaints. It's a shuttle, not a private car. There will be other people on it. At least it isn't Greyhound! We considered the bus, but it just seemed too spooky, not to mention unreliable. Maybe the girls are just so used to travel ling van crowded with children and animals that the shuttle seems luxurious in comparison. I think AZ Shuttle runs great service at a decent price, particularly for families with college students. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have been here a couple times now and it's definitely a place to check out. As so many yelpers have already mentioned, the chopped salad is delicious. Definitely something to try at Citizen. Also, the pastrami!!! Oh man, that was so melt in your mouth yummy! Smaller portion, probably not a meal for most but it was so good I would order it again. The lamb burger is a huge meal that comes with perfectly crispy scrumptious fries. The patty isn't cut down with beef or pork so the flavor is very game-y which can be a good thing if you are into that. I wasn't quite so used to it. :) I also tried a bit of my friend's Smart Chicken which was amazingly tender and juicy and perfectly seasoned! Also, really organic and fresh which I love. I tried the Citi-zen mixed drink which was very lemony and a bit on the sour side. I wasn't in love with the flavor. I did however love the rock candy that came with it. lol. The service was awesomeeeeee!!! We came in near closing but they still happily sat us instead of shooing us away. Our waiter was very attentive, answered all our questions about the menu and made some great suggestions. He also took us on a tour of the speak easy style bar upstairs which was super interesting! Apparently you go around the side of the building and there's a posting of ""the rules"". You call the number and if they have room you will be let up to this chic modern bar.

 Real Foods in Tollcross is a slightly smaller version of the store in Broughton Street, but like it's sister, it has the same big ideas when it comes to food: local, seasonal and organic are the key words. As it doesn't have quite as much floor space, it stocks less fresh food, but you'll still find a well stocked chiller with falafel, hoummus, Jordan Valley pasties etc; massive sacks of muesli that the staff will helpfully weigh out for you; and, shelves full of veggie/vegan pasta sauces.

 My first experience at a Dine-in Theater! Such a great idea, like seriously this is the connecting link between purchasing foods at concessions and a dining experience at the theater. I came here with Khoa N. to watch Guardians of the Galaxy and previously booked our tickets online, love how you can choose where your seats are located so you don't have to worry about other people stealing your chair and all that nonsense. Once seated we looked over our menus and got our orders taken. I had an Appletini and we shared a small order of Onion Rings and Buffalo wings. The drink was good, delicious with that alchy kick. Food is decent, think Applebee's or Red Robin's quality. Overpriced? Hell yeah, but it's the novelty of being served food and eating a full on dish inside a movie theater. Only cons were Khoa's beer glass was luke warm and dirty. For a dine-in theater I expected it to be a lot louder during the showtime, but the noise level was pretty quiet. Comfy big chairs and alcohol during a movie? Can I get another hell yeah? The service was good, we were served and brought the bill. The servers weren't too distracting either. If you park in the lot, get your parking ticket validated before you leave it's right by the exit. Esplandade 14 you have ruined me from watching movies at a regular theater, it was totally worth it!

 My boyfriend and I stayed at the Rio this past weekend. We chose to stay here in order to save a few bucks. Typically we like to stay at the Wynn or the Trump Towers. Anyway we checked into a non-smoking room that had a king size bed. The good news:The view was decent. It wasn't a strip view but we could see the Palms casino from where we were. The room was very spacious. It had a desk area and a living room area with a couch & coffee table. There was a mini-fridge, the windows were nice and large ( wall to wall), the tv had a swivel pull out shelf, there's 2 sinks in the bathroom area. One sink is in the vanity area and the other in the actual bathroom. The bad news: The walls are paper thin! I could hear every conversation happening in either of the neighboring rooms. The carpet had some fruit punch looking stains. The drapes didn't completely cover the windows so in the morning when the sun started to come up a sliver of light would shine through, but it was bright enough to wake us up. The vanity area was nice a spacious, but the tub is TINY! The door could practically hit the toilette it was so small in there. It was also out dated. The bed was also the most uncomfortable bed we've ever slept on. The springs practically came shooting out of the matress and left marks on our backs. The pillows were also very uncomfortable. The check in lines were insanely long. There were about 4 out of 8 stations with employees checking people in. We also tried the famous ""world buffet"" that they have there. There is a wide selection, but the quality is so-so and you're lucky if the servers remember you exist! It was almost impossible to get a refill on our drinks. Next time we will not skimp or try to save a few bucks. It's not worth it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Well, I have been here twice. The first time was delicious, and we were sooooo excited to go back and get the same exact thing. (Mixed Fajitas with chicken, beef, shrimp, carnitas and chorizo). The first time everything was delicious ,and the carnitas were to die for! It was my favorite thing and I honestly couldn't stop eating it. The second time, we were served some strange cut of pork that honestly made my stomach turn. It was very fatty and honestly tasted spoiled. We mentioned it to our server, stating how it was very different our first experience, and she just looked rather confused. We both got sick to our stomachs and could not finish our meal. And honestly, I couldn't fathom eating Mexican again for a few weeks, when it's my favorite kind of food! The portions are huge and prices are fair there, but this meal ruined it for me.

 I'm not going to lie and say this is the best sushi, but it is a good value. You kinda have to know what to choose, and once that's figured out it can make for a pretty good dining experience. I would not recommend going at a slow time, and I would recommend choosing the more popular dishes as those are usually the freshest due to turnover rate. They also offer made to order sushi, which will be the freshest choice but that can take some time. This place is great for a quick, healthy, and cheap lunch or dinner. ",0,0,0,1,0

 It seems I may be in the minority, but I wouldn't go out of my way for Fat Heads. Perhaps I was in a bad mood because the only thing worse than Pittsburghers driving in snow is Pittsburghers parking in snow (and it was impossible to find somewhere to park on Saturday afternoon). Perhaps it was the hour plus wait to get a table - 4/6 people in our group wanted Fat Heads, so I was forced to wait. Hungry Angelica does not wait well. I don't know, but something wasn't making this trip super-special for me. Three of us got burgers. While they were good, they weren't amazing. I was getting full and wanted to finish the patty sans bun, which was a mistake. My burger, the Renee, comes with cheese, cheese sauce (overkill), mushrooms, and bacon and you really need all of that cheese because the meat on mine was a little dry and had no flavor when eaten off the bun. Another had the Nicole and noted that the fried onion straws were basically non-existent. I've had that before and they pile it with onion straws; this time, there was only a sprinkling of chopped pieces (the leftovers perhaps). A third person had a classic bacon cheeseburger with an egg and it was finished with great gusto. Also ordered by others were wings, a steak sandwich, and a taco salad. The wings were good and spicy, the steak sandwich wasn't commented on, and the taco salad was good, but just kind of there - nothing special. Pros: extensive craft beer list with a cask on tap, huge menu (though it has direction - you know you're getting some good, classic bar food), wings, bar atmosphere. Cons: inconsistencies in the kitchen with preparation and presentation, some burgers not living up to the hype. Will I come here again? Yes, but I'll order something different and it won't be during a busy afternoon rush. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I had the meat and cheese pasty with the red wine gravy..all I can say is that my mouth was soooo happy the entire time I was eating it! I did not eat in the restaurant, my husband ate there and brought me home the pasty. You have to put it in the oven for about 15-25 minutes, and the crust continues to cook though and becomes buttery, flakey, and delicious. The red wine gravy was very flavorful and added extra goodness to the sausage and cheese that was inside. I can not wait to try some other fillings on my next visit. Also, the husband said that even though they were packed at lunch, they still received excellent service in the restaurant. They bake each pasty when ordered, so it does a little while to get your order...at least 25-35 minutes. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Went to RigaTony's on Friday for lunch - this was my first visit to this to this establishment in a long time. This is the relatively new Chandler location, and I really like the way they have the restaurant and patio arranged. We were seated immediately, but afterward it took ten minutes before a server stopped at our table to take our orders. It was exceptionally busy, the server did apologize for the delay, and other than that glitch the service was fine from then on, so it wouldn't be anything that would keep me from returning. This time I ordered the four cheese ravioli, which was really good - I would recommend this to anyone. The antipasto salad, which I have always enjoyed at RigaTony's, was great - as was the freshly baked bread that they provided to snack on. In the past I have been a little reluctant to choose RigaTony's because I wasn't really a big fan of their menu, but after this visit I noticed that they offer more of a variety of food choices that are certain to keep me coming back.

 Meh. A ton of overpriced Hershey souvenirs set amongst a variety of Hershey candy comparable to a grocery store. They do have huge sculptures of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty made out of chocolate, which are kinda cool, but other than that, nothing. No interesting facts or history about Hershey. One bonus is the bakery section. Well, they're not actually making anything, so it's not a bakery, but a sweets shop I guess. Whatever it is, it has some pretty good stuff. We sampled the cookie and buttercream sandwich and the s'more. Both were really good, even at $5+. The coke world has this upstairs bar where you can sample different cokes from all over the world, which is super cool. Hershey world, if you're reading this, how about adding something like that???

 Located inside the Tuscany Casino where we stayed while in Vegas for a convention. Our party of ten came for dinner. Plenty of seating for large groups.

 My friend and I made appointments together for mani-pedis for first thing when the salon opened at 9 a.m. on a Thursday. The salon is spacious and clean, and has two pedicure areas...one that is a row, and one that is circular. When putting us ""next"" to each other in the circular area, we were at 30 degree angles to each other's backs. A bit difficult to carry on a conversation. No one asked us how we wanted our appointments handled, just rushed at us both with one person on the feet and one person on the hands all at once. We were looking forward to a relaxing pedicure, then a leisurely manicure before a nice lunch. One out of three happened. We had a nice lunch. Both of us have regular salons we go to, but this was half way between our residences, and that is why we chose it. You would have thought there was going to be a stampede of customers the way they rushed us through our grooming. Once finished, we each paid by credit card. No tips are allowed to be added to charges, but they will happily direct you to the ATM they have right inside the salon. I gave the man who did my pedicure a $20.00 bill and told him that was for both my friend and myself for our gratuities. He said, ""all FOUR?"" I told him...yeeees, for the two of us, for all four people who helped us. Again, he repeated, ""All FOUR?"" And it became quite clear he was not happy with that amount of a tip. Two manicures, two pedicures, approximately $120.00, and we were given the bum's rush. I thought it was quite generous all things considered. There was no thank you, no hope to see you again. Five days later, my friend told me that her cuts were healing. The man cut her in four places on her heel. And her French manicures on her toes and fingers were already cracking and chipping. Nice. Not to worry. We shall not darken your door again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My new ""Best Meal Ever"" to which all other dining experiences will be compared, unseating an anniversary dinner at Anissa in New York in 2007. Really a fantastic meal and amazing restaurant, everything from service, food, presentation, wine list, design and view are top notch. The foursome I was with were so impressed we made a 2nd reservation as we were walking out to return in a few months when Chef Gagnaire is supposedly going to be in town and actually in the kitchen. My first three star Michelin chef experience was even better than I expected. We decided to go the a la carte route so we could share and try more things. I could tell the direction this was going right from the start with the amuse bouche that included 6 different tastings. Favorites here were the Tuna Mousse served with a rice based cracker and these irish jello shots (i can't recall what they were actually called but that is the best description I can come up) Appetizers that stood out for me was the Lagostines served 5 ways and the scallops served 3 ways. I ordered the veal but unfortunately they had run out, which in retrospect makes even me surprised I'm still willing to give Twist 5 stars. The Lamb served three ways though made me quickly forget about the lack of veal. This included a perfectly cooked lamb chop and a fantastic lamb shoulder dumpling. Two at our table ordered the Rib Eye which was served two ways. The grilled rib eye was great, but the 2nd plate of rib eye tips was a bit disappointing to some of us. Another ordered the halibut which was probably my favorite of all the main courses. For desert the souffle was amazing. Overall the food here is fantastic, with incredible presentation. The variety of techniques and presentation used is quite impressive. I highly suggest to anyone looking for a special occasion type restaurant in Vegas or if you just feel like splurging on a great meal. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was looking forward to trying this restaurant. My first and only Vietnamese restaurant experience is in my part of town, and what a great place it is! At Lang Van, it is all fresh herbs and homemade sauces. So, with great anticipation, I went. I was glad to see that Doan's has a vegetarian menu. The only accessible menu online was a snapshot. There was glare, and I think that the vegetarian part was omitted. I ordered the summer rolls as an appetizer. They were nicely wrapped and included tofu, vegetables and noodles. The peanut sauce was served in a squeeze bottle, which I found somewhat off putting. It also was sweet and syrupy, reminding me of carmel sauce. For my entree, I ordered Pad Thai. It came with tofu and vegetables, all cooked very well. It had a smattering of peanuts to the side of the plate. It wasn't very spicy, although I think the description called it as such. I put a large amount of siracha sauce on it to add that bite that I love. The dish also seemed a bit more sweet than savory. The service was good, and it definitely was not a bad experience. But, I will probably stay on my side of town when I am craving Vietnamese food. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I think the lack of places to eat in QC has clouded the judgment of most of these reviewers. They wedged our small two person party in to a table that was practically on top of a huge family which made us and them uncomfortable. Our waitress was absent for 98% of the meal. The Bruscetta was terrible as the toast was soaked in butter and oil. Both pasta dishes that we ordered were good but not worth the poor service and bad appetizer. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Not a fan. Seating is pretty bad- either on the ""outdoor patio"" (freezing, very few heaters, lots of people smoking, overlooking the driveway to the mall garage with cars driving through the entire time) or inside (smells wierd, tables placed awkwardly, people walking through the mall stare at you while you're eating)... Service was awful, super slow, at least 20 minutes before he asked to take our order... Brought out drinks at different times (c'mon guys, there were only 2 of us...). Maybe their staff is holding out- saving up the impressive service for Valentine's weekend? Either way, won't be eating there again. Ick. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Shut your mouth! Meatloaf of the Gods! There are three types of meat rolled into this meatloaf. It comes with a red wine gravy, mashed potatoes and veggies. All of this for $10. Yup, a complete, well-rounded, mouth watering meal for just $10. The broccoli was blanched rather than steam. So it was not mushy. The service is incredible. The people are friendly and the food comes up fast. I have nothing but good things to say. On a date? With family? Have a small child? Check this place out. They get desserts from a local bakery. The carrot cake is ridiculous. Are you full from your meal? Take cake or pie to go. Seriously, you will not regret a snack for later. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I spent Memorial Day weekend here strictly because it was the best deal on the strip that me & my buddies could find. Plus, we didn't plan on being in the room very much anyway. There were 5 of us, and it ended up being about $100 each for 4 nights. That's means more money for boozing up. The hotel room was better than I expected, it looked clean, nice big lcd tv, pretty spacious overall. There was no view of the strip where we were staying though. The buffet suck big ass too. Luckily, I didn't spend much on it (2 for 1 deal = $10 each). There was a food court with the standard food you'd expect to find: McDonald's, Quizno's, Krispy Kream etc. There was also a Dick's Last Resort. The pool was cool, but there were way too many granny's and kids around. I was almost ashamed to be hungover and reek of alcohol around them. The best part of the Excalibur though, was the Party Pit. That place was the business. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I actually found Copperline plumbing (Gabe) on Yelp and I'm thankful I did. I was out of town on business and my wife called me and said our kitchen floor was hot. Well, we don't have floor warmers so we knew something was wrong. We knew enough to know we had to turn off the hot water, and then we found Copperline on Yelp, and called Gabe. He had us call a leak detector and have them come out and locate the water leak and then he would come out and estimate and repair it. The locating company did not do a great job at locating the leak so it presented Gabe with an extra challenge, but Gabe figured it all out and did a great job reparing it. I also had to replace my water heater at the same time and he took care of that as well, and disposed of my old one. Gabe is a workhorse. He does whatever it takes to get the job done right, the first time. He's patient and understanding and has great customer service skills. The job he did for my house required re-routing the primary water line, and it was not an easy job. I have an older house and he had to cut some walls and crawl around in the attic a little, but he did everything it took to make sure it was done right. I appreciate that and we will ALWAYS call Gabe for all our plumbing needs from now on. ",0,0,0,0,1

 My first and so far only time to Baladie Cafe was a good trial run. I ordered thte Greek Platter that comes with lamb/beef gyro, tzatziki sauce, feta cheese, dolmas, kalamata olives, a small greek salad, spanikopita and mousaka. It was the best way I knew to try everything I wanted. A brilliant idea in my mind. I was mostly pleased with the experience. The dolmas were very good and very briney. And thankfully the leaves were tender. The last time I had dolmas from Whole Foods the leaves were so tough and woody. The ones from Baladie were quite good. I know where to go when I get a craving now. The olives were spot on too. On their own I don't have a problem with the kalamata olives containing a pit. At least it is expected. I did not appreciate that they were unpitted in the salad. I almost broke a tooth. I suppose I just need to be more careful in the future. Moving onto the gyro I would have to say not bad but not wonderful. The meat had more lamb flavor than what I am accustomed to. That is not a problem though. It really was quite good. But in all honesty the meat was a little on the dry side. And the pita was not all too fresh either. It was also kind of dry and was served in a store bought pita package. It could have been better. Where Baladie really shined in my mind was with the mousaka and spanikopita. I've had spanikopita other places before and really did not like it despite my love for spinach. This was good and the pastry was ultra flakey. Right on. The mousaka I was surprised with. I had never tried it before and did not know quite what to expect. The eggplant, potato and meat combination of it was awesome. It was rich and creamy and just plain good. I'm kind of drooling right now just thinking of it. I could easily make a meal out of mousaka as it is very heavy and filling. Beyond the food service was great. The older gentelman (owner?) was great. He was very friendly and curious as to how I heard about them. I told him Yelp led me there and he started telling me about how a lot of his customers mention Yelp and also Urban Spoon. He was asking me about some of the other review sites like Trip Advisor but I showed some Yelp love and brought the conversation back around. I'm not that familiar with the other sites anyhow. He was a nice man and happy for me to be there. I'll be back sometime. ",0,0,0,1,0

 If you're going to come here to gamble, I suggest you don't. There are other casinos here on Fremont St. that seem to make you feel more comfortable and not old fashioned. Well if you do like old fashioned, I guess this is the place for you. I can't really rate this place for how it is hotel-wise and staff wise, as I just come here strictly to walk through and eat at the Market Cafe. So my rating isn't for the hotel, but just the basic layout and how old fashioned it is. I know this place won't change the way it looks as they're probably preserving the looks of old Vegas with this place. I'm probably the only person to rate this place a 3 stars, so I'm probably missing something on how good the hotels are at this place. Sorry to say though, I probably wont ever experience staying at this hotel or any hotel in Vegas for awhile as long as my sister lives down here. All in all thank goodness this place has market cafe, otherwise this place probably won't exist for me. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have been to BC twice now, but I would have never even thought to try it if it weren't for the suggestion of my college classmate, who is from LA. Each visit, I have ordered 1lb of shrimp with sha-bang mild with an order of corn in the bag. I've also had the crab legs and lobster but although I have a taste for expensive eats, lobster and crab legs just don't do it for mel. I've sampled the crawfish too from a friend's bag but for me, there's no point to ordering crawfish unless it's the right season! But: the shrimp in sha-bang mild is a godsend. The sauce is a mixture of garlic and heaven and if you don't try it, you're sincerely missing out. Large, perfectly cooked shrimp with the head still on (eating tip: rip the head off, suck some flavor out, then peel and eat the shrimp meet. ::drool::). I love getting messy and eating with my hands, but of you've got a problem with that, BC probably isn't your place! Seafood orders come out in a plastic bag and after that: game on. Put on your bib, roll back your sleeves, and dig in! I've also sampled the Cajun fries (addicting and delicious) the sweet potato fries, and the fried catfish. All wonderful! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because our orders have been mixed up on both visits and overall, the service hasn't been five-star worthy. IMHO: Boiling Crab BEATS Hot 'N Juicy, hands down. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This TJ Maxx was recently renovated about 2 years ago, so everything is actually very well organized and clean for a discounted department store. The dressing rooms are brand new! When it comes to buying clothes, I prefer Marshall's over TJ Maxx. However, they do have a good selection of home goods here. They also have a pretty good jewelry section here which is NOT available at Marshalls, so this is a plus. When I say jewelry I mean sterling silver and chain necklaces and charms and pendants, not just fashion jewelry. They also have a good selection of purses here and beauty and hair products. Overall no complaint about this store! I have been frequenting this store for the past 5 years. If you need something for your home but do not want to pay the high price tag to get quality brand name items, check this place out before you hit up more expensive options! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Slow food service, greasy bar food, but the mixed drinks are a savior to avoid the single star. Cheap drinks, bring in a less than respectful crowd at times, muscle and meat crowd. Do not wear clothes you are not ready to discard in the garage and wash as the smoke is heavy, and be ready for a shower or the smell transfers to the sheets. My wife refuses to go in, as her long hair traps all. The guys and I are good on the happy hour, mainly for cost sometimes, but a good look around would contradict the reviews that say it is ""clean"". Exlir and Distil, owned by same group, are definitely a step up from the original Remedy's.

 Mom and I decided to check this place out when a cousin and her soon-to-be 18-year-old daughter visiting from NJ went to check out Forever 21 (a store I've never found anything I wanted to purchase from). Love Culture has some very cute clothing! Inexpensive, too- I was able to find four fun spring-summery tops (between $13-$22) I could actually wear under a suit for work. Brightly-lit, colorful, and nicely-spaced aisles. Staff seemed friendly enough. Am not a fan of their return policy, though. I was only told about the 22-day policy at checkout, and nothing about how sale items, shoes, and accessories were final sale. Only found out about the latter when I wanted to return a purse the next day, only to be told that it could not be returned per policy which was printed on the back of the receipt. I went around the area where the purses and shoes were, and NOWHERE, not even at the check-out counter, were there any signs that mentioned final sale. I'd still visit to see what pretty clothing I may find, but I'd definitely think thrice about purchasing from their shoes, accessories, and sale items. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I adore MAC make-up and their liquid Studio Fix foundation is the best foundation I've ever used with a coverage that last all day! On my last visit to the MAC counter in Harvery Nic's, I was topping up on my Studio Fix as I was running a little low. As always, there girls working looked amazing with the most perfect make-up, it must be so annoying having to put it on to go to work for 9 in the morning, especially if you've been out the night before. I wonder how long it takes them? Anyway, when I requested another bottle of my favourite foundation the girl who served me was really friendly and helpful and even let me try a couple of the new eyeshadow colours and I left with a gold shade that was really pretty and a perfect shade for the summer. If you're looking for make-up that makes a statement then head along to MAC, the staff are always very knowledgeable about all the products and are highly skilled make-up artists so you can try out new looks too. If you're into more subtle make-up then you can still find colours to suit at the MAC counter but it works best if you're looking for bold, bright colours and aren't afraid to try out new looks.

 This place reaffirms my philosophy that, when eating with a group, sampling is deadly. But I'll get to that later. Right off the bat, I liked the decor, but I've also been going to school in Tucson for the last 4 years sooo... I'm easily impressed. If only the food could mirror the wonder of the interior design. I ordered the Katsu Bento which was overcooked to the point where it resembled shoe leather, and I ended up giving away two pieces of my sashimi since there were no substitutes and I was really only craving salmon sashimi. Obviously, I was disappointed. I did try my mom's grouper and mushroom appetizer which was piled high on a bed of mashed potatoes, and it was freaking bomb! As in, taste bud explosion! Oh yes, gotta love that I'm-going-to-be-salivating-over-someone-else's-lunch-the-entire-time-because-theirs-is-way-better meal! See, sampling is deadly. I also ordered the mochi dessert which I assumed was ice cream mochi. Ah, silly me - why didn't I automatically know that ""Mochi"" meant sherbet mochi?

 Typically when you go to a sea food restaurant you order a sea food platter. But I don't like sea food too much so I ordered a chicken dish. Maybe...no, definitely avoid their chicken. I highly doubt they are serving fresh chicken. It had a really weird texture, I can't explain it but trust me it was not quality. Plus it was the thinnest cut, half if it fatty and the bottom of it was over cooked so over all I had four bites worth at most. My daughter really enjoyed the crab legs and her broccoli, she didn't touch her Mac and cheese. My fianc \ u00e9 and my sister really liked their crab legs and lobster. FOR ME, the best part of dinning at this Red Lobster was their garlic biscuits, I love those tastey little rolls. The host was really nice, we were seated quickly, we were helped by a server (Linda) right away and she was very sweet. The food came out in good time as well and our drinks were refilled without having to ask. BIG FAT NEGATIVE... There were two flies hanging around our table, landing on the sides of our glasses and attempting to rest on our platted food. When I looked over at the big windows there was a few more flies hanging out on them. Very unappetizing to see.

But what took it from wonderful to mediocre was the tomato sauce. Both appetizers came with the same sauce that might as well have been out of a can. In fact, the first thing my husband said about the ravioli was, ""It reminds me of Chef Boyardee."" Indeed. We then shared the chicken pasta with pesto sauce, and it was just a little too salty for me. Although I have to say that the pesto sauce was much more exciting than the tomato sauce. The chicken was cooked well and was not dry. As other reviewers mentioned, the portions are a little on the small side. The service was friendly and attentive, and if I could, I'd give this place 4 stars. But because I feel like I could have had this same food anywhere else, it just doesn't quite get there for me.

 I've seen Mystere and Ka, but this show blows them both out of the water! THE BEST SHOW I'VE EVER SEEN! And I'm into arts and entertainment, so I've seen quite a few amazing shows. We purchased discounted seats (front row) at Tickets4Tonight - which I highly recommended if you are looking for last minute discounted shows and dinners. But there are no bad seats in this venue (theater of the round). I cried about 5 times (no, I wasn't drunk). It was just such a beautiful show. In the end, Sgt. Pepper came out and handed me and another audience member a rose (I nearly died). It really hits home if you're a Beatles fan, and if not... you will still absolutely love this show! ",0,0,0,0,1

 You have to completely and utterly tanked to enjoy Toppers. Period. There is no other reason any reasonable person would ever want to put this shit into their body. This is the result of Ronald McDonald and the Noid conceiving a demon baby in a pit of flaming grease. I have personally witnessed the reinforced cardboard pizza box fall apart under the pressure of that seeping acid they call oil. You will have burning diarrhea for days. There is good cheese everywhere in Wisconsin; the pudding-like goop they put on top of their pizza is not an excuse to do this to yourself. Combine this with the fact that they have the most arrogant, inattentive customer service in the history of restaurants, and it makes for the shittiest dining experience possible. It takes no less than an hour to get a pizza from here, but it leans more towards 2-3 hours when it's late and the drunk idiots with no taste barrage the place with orders. I am pretty sure that eating at Toppers is forbidden in the Old Testament. For the sake of yourself, everyone in smelling distance of you, and the children with birth defects you may father/mother if you continue to eat here, just put down the phone. Upped to 2 stars because I enjoyed it in a drunken, shameful moment of weakness. May or may not have cried afterwards. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Go to DTLV or Fremont, check your Yelp friend's check in's and it's almost guaranteed that on a Thursday, Friday, and/or Saturday that at least 2 of them are at the Commonwealth. This equals good spot for drinks and and to chill. The Commonwealth in DTLV is a now a common meet up spot for most locals. This bar/lounge offers a different type of setting then your usual out here like the Griffin, Downtown Cocktail, Insert Coins, and the Vanguard. I actually like the ambiance at the Commonwealth and if you get a little stuffy, you can also migrate upstairs to their outdoor patio. Big plus, tons of beautiful people out here. Drinks are average to your strip prices, California bar scene, and strip clubs. For someone coming out to Vegas to party, they would never know the difference. For someone like me who doesn't hit the bar scene too much anymore and prefer comp drinks in a casino, this is my biggest issue. $20 for two drinks. Other lounges in downtown are definitely cheaper. I'm a fan, but still prefer Downtown Cocktails or even Bar & Billiards. I'm sure to take a few out of town friends here in the future for the ambiance alone. Besides, they wouldn't know the difference in price anyways. It's ""Vegas Baby"" to them. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have been to this location twice and have had two similar experiences. The first time I was with my wife and the half the food we ordered was disappointing. Unfortunately the ribs were the most expensive and disappointing part of the meal! We shared a huge nacho appetizer and they were good. The server was great. The second time I was in a group and the food was all average. Nothing stood out and nobody in the group had good things to say when leaving. There was a fair variety of meals ordered from fish and pork to burgers. It was just average chain restaurant food. The server sucked but was wearing assless chaps and underwear. That seems good till she bends over pick up a fork dropped at the table next to you. That is interesting to say the least! They do have fair priced drinks. They use mason jars for beers and mixed drinks which is pretty cool. My wife once ordered a mason jar mixed drink for around 14 dollars and it was to strong for her. I tried it and it was on the strong side, but I would rather that than the alternative. All in all, I will not return to this location for dinner, maybe for drinks and appetizers at best...

 Ellis Island is a little off-the-Strip Vegas gem! My friend who lives in Vegas took me here to watch the UCLA USC game during Thanksgiving weekend. We got a seat at the bar, got a couple beers (did you know they brew their own beers? I didn't know this until I got there, and they're only $2!), and cheered the Bruins until halftime! It's a pretty chill casino compared to all the hustle and bustle of the strip. The bartenders were nice and accommodating in changing the TVs for us to watch the game. Apparently, the food is is not bad either.. perhaps I'll come back to try the steak, but I'm def glad I got to explore this place as a chiller alternative to the Strip. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I will always love this place, mostly because it is one of the few places open 24 hours a day where I can always get a bacon cheeseburger regardless of the hour. The price is always right, too. Highly recommended! Cash only but they do have an ATM inside. If you need separate checks be sure to mention it up front, though. Our waitress was a tad rude when we asked her to split the cost at the register because she had already added it up and when she gave us change didn't even give us small bills.

 This was by far the best dining experience I have had. The reservation for 9 people was at 8pm on a Friday night and we were seated by 8:05. As I walked in I heard someone say that it was the best steak he had ever had, and I soon came to agree. The service was outstanding with the waiter taking the time to have conversations with us and answering questions about many things rather than just serve and leave. It actually didn't take long at all for anything. The only part I would have been able to do without was the meat cart. By the time he went to get it everyone knew what they wanted to order and I don't find looking at a large cart of raw cuts of steak very appealing, but I'm sure in the future we can just request to have that skipped. The bread was wonderful and there was a variety which is nice. The water was bottled and imported from the UK and we were given a choice of the type (sparkling or still). The beverage menu was on an iPad which was cool because you could just order on there rather than wait for the waiter. The steak was amazing and the loaded baked potato was huge and also delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are in Vegas. You won't be disappointed. ",0,0,0,0,1

 fruity, decadent, and bursting with flavor, oh my! mercurio's, modestly tucked away in a little nook, is pretty sweet (no pun intended..okay maybe). upon entrance, you are greeted with colors that razzle, dazzle, and entice you, along with a friendly staff. the gelato all looks so good that you can't help but ask to sample a few. and sample a few i did. i flirted with the cinnamon bun for a while, and it was incredible, but also incredibly rich. the mango was good, but they went the sweeter route when i was more interested in a tangy one. the pistachio was creamy and not too sweet--just the way it should be. after all was said and done, i decided i wanted a medium cup that consisted of one fruity and one rich gelato. cue pink guava and gianduia (a sweet chocolate that contains about 30% hazelnut paste..think a light and fluffy nutella). it didn't matter what flavor you picked..the gelato was the same consistency as the gelato i had in piazza navona. pink and brown is a good combination on its own, but the flavors worked surprisingly well together. the heavier gianduia was balanced by the pink guava, which made me nostalgic as it reminded me of the philippine pomelo. sinful yet refreshing. at 62 cents an ounce, my medium cup (which is 5-8 ounces generally) came to about $3.50. i took a star off because i happened to get the coagulated, thick top part of the gelato that has a texture similar to a cheap sugary bubblegum that you can't fully enjoy. in the scheme of things, that top part is so tiny compared with the rest of the gelato you get, and if i'm ever back in the 'burgh, i'll be hitting up mercurio's for a new creative pairing.

 The alley itself is nice inside, and they do cheap bowling night during the week (Thursdays I think). I've bowled in a couple of tournaments here. I get the feeling that Squaw Peak Lanes used to be an old big-box store of some sort, because it's part of the Food City strip mall and there's no recessed step down into the bowling area like most alleys have. An OK place to bowl, and the service was good, but I think there are better alleys in town. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Ok, this place is a toss up. The hotel rooms are cheap, you can't stay at your local holiday inn for the price here. With that being said this place is a great value for what you're paying. The rooms are average, nothing special, same with the casino and buffet. The location is greedy, easy walk to several casinos, fairly centrally located on the strip. We left the casino during the day and only returned to the Monte Carlo to sleep. They gave great customer service at the front desk, if you're gambling, DONT expect to get a drink. The ONLY was we got any drinks here were walking up to the bar and playing the slots there, and we only got one after the bartender decided to come over and ask us if we wanted anything which took awhile. But all in all this place is one of the best places to stay for the value!!! It is not a bad hotel by any means. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I use to go to this place when I worked down the street; all I can say is that the garlic knots are really, really good. I've had their small pizzas, and they were nothing to go back for. I had actually forgotten about this place until my friend wanted to pick up pizza- a local pizza, and happened to be close to this place. My friend bought us a Margarita pizza from here with a dozen garlic knots. For the price you pay this is really bland pizza. The cheese looks odd, and the sauce is tasteless. The garlic knots, though, are still pretty darn good. Not only that, but apparently this place likes to hand out liquid magma pizzas to people who order out. My friend got hers (after a long wait and many mess ups) sat it in her car, only to find that it was leaking. Literally leaking, as if it were made of liquid. The entire toppings area was now running down the crust onto the box, and thankfully she had not been holding it when it happened, or else she would have burned by it. By the time she got it to my home, it had cooled enough to somewhat solidify to what resembled a pizza. A little warning would have been nice, since this soup of a pizza could have been leaked all over her, or the car. Still even after a few years their pizza is nothing to remember; but the knots are.

 This one was attached to the gas station here at my corner and I've never been inside, and even though I like McDonalds. I rarely eat here except for bkfst once a week, on my way to work. But I had to stop in and get my filling of McRib (YEA BABY) :-) When I walked inside, it was actually VERY nice looking. It didn't look like the typical McDonalds dining room. It had beautiful cushion benches/booths and it was quiet too. You would've thought you were in a nice coffee house. The price for my McRib was $1.99 each (which seemed like a fair price) I had that and a medium fry and an order of chocolate chip cookies (I love their cookies). I got home, the sandwiches were hot and yummmmmmmmyyy. Fries were just ok, and the cookies were really good too. If I just wanted to get out sometime and go for a coffee or a small treat or bkfst.

 The decor, ambience, and comfort would be about 4 stars for this place and I would definitely come here again if I needed somewhere to do work and not have blaring music (which indie coffee shops often do). The high ceilings help make it seem larger than it is, and it's already quite spacious. They have plugs and free wifi and the staff let us work there for about 4 hours without giving us a hassle. Since the place is so big, we weren't taking up space for others. However, their coffee is lackluster, but not as bad the brunch I had. I am mostly gluten free, but definitely wheat free. I ordered the poached eggs (because their hollandaise had wheat), with yogurt and granola and fresh fruit. "".oeufs poch \ u00e9s avec fromage cottage ou yaourt, granola maison, fruits frais, pain 8 c \ u00e9r \ u00e9ales"" I asked for no bread and after some discussion, the waiter said she will give me more fruit in place of the bread. I mean, I understand bread is cheap, but gluten-free is common nowadays, I can't be expected to pay full price for something that is exchangeable. The poached egg(s) were in a ramekin which made me pretty suspicious of them being made in a microwave, especially considering their consistency - hardly runny yolk and tough whites. Rookie mistake a resto should not be making. The fruit was ok, seemed a bit basic, and would have preferred local in-season fruit. It is August after all. The granola was also meh. My friend had the same thing, so I can't comment on the other food, but by this I probably won't be having food there again. Although maybe.... ",0,0,1,0,0

 Great, huge New York slices are to be had at Pizza Sola and the toppings are interesting enough to set them apart from other shops. One slice could be considered two normal slices so bring your appetite. My only complaint is that their pizza is a bit on the pricy side. Everything about it was fresh, however. Their baked chicken wings were to die for. I usually only get chicken wings that are deep fried, giving them that familiar crispiness. However, Pizza Sola roasts theirs in their insanely hot pizza oven, giving them a nice charred skin that is packed full of flavor. My girlfriend and I both remarked that these roasted, blackened wings were actually better than most fried wings we've had in Pittsburgh. Prices aside, Pizza Sola knows how to make a pie. They also get kudos for having a comfortable seating area inside, something most pizza shops of their calibre don't have the space to do. ",0,0,1,0,0

 They'll try to cheat you, but bottom line ... I'll probably rent from them again. Saw the reviews here and was wary, but they're significantly cheaper than anyplace else, and the car was a new looking Hyundai and in very good condition. I was careful to explicitly ... and repeatedly decline all add-ons, yet was presented a contract that looked suspiciously more expensive than the estimated charges I'd previously printed out. Only then did I notice that ""James"" had 1) failed to return the printout I'd shown him and 2) he'd surreptitiously covered it with various other documents. They use scare tactics to convince you to pay for additional insurance, roadside assistance, etc. but be aware that your insurance for your own car usually covers you for rentals. Additionally, ""primary insurance"" coverage for vehicle rentals is provided gratis with some credit cards -- I use the Continental Airlines OnePass Plus MasterCard (Google it). I almost ranked them 1 star because of my experience with ""James"" at the counter. However, I got a decent car for cheap and my experience returning it was uneventful. ",0,1,0,0,0

 One of the reasons that I love Vegas so much is, as the saying goes ""What goes on in Vegas...."" things you may do there you may not be able to do at home or in your home town. Case in point, assume I drive down to Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo. I head over to the food court and slide over to the juice bar for a smoothie and get comfortable. I then sit down and pull out a churchill sized Arturo Fuente God of Fire, and begin to light it. Before the tip of the cigar even begins its glowy red path, I am immediately pummeled with various food products and verbal epitaphs, especially from a rather surly group of girl scouts and gray-haired retirees. This is not the scenario at Casa Fuente at the Forum Shops in Caesars Palace, oh quite the contrary. At Casa Fuente the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. And while the selection is limited to actual Fuente family produced cigars Montesino, Ashton, etc, the entire Fuente line is available. Including the above mentioned God of Fire, Double X, all the Hemingways, and the exclusive Casa Fuentes sold only at the store. The best is after purchasing your Arturo, you venture out of store sit at the bar or at the caf \ u00e9 tables order up a round of mojitos or cuba libres, pull out your cigar and light up....ahhhhh sit and watch all the people go buy. Draw deep on the Dominican beauty in one hand and exhale, and then take a sip of your adult beverage in the other. Life is pretty good at this point. Not to mention the reactions of those who may double take, then realize ""Oh yeah we're in Vegas, it's okay"". Pricey perhaps, but it's about the total experience. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I am now most of the way through my second pregnancy and have been scheduling with John on a regular basis to help my body adjust. Space has a bodyCushion pillow for maternity massage and it is HEAVEN. During my prenatal massages I can lie face down and the pillow supports my back, spine, and hips allowing my weight to be distributed evenly around a belly pocket. As all pregnant mothers know, being able to lie on your stomach while pregnant is near impossible. It is a true treat and joy to be able to lie face down while getting my amazing massage! John began using the pillow starting at about 11 weeks and we are still using it at 32+ weeks. The pillow has fit my varied sizes perfectly all along my pregnancy! The only problem is how sad I am that I don't have one of these special pillows at home. John is highly attuned to my needs, which is the main reason why I have been a loyal client for almost 5 years now. Whether pregnant, having soreness from working out , or just in need of relaxation after a long work week, he always adjusts his techniques and style for me.

 Let me start of by saying i should have written this a few days ago when we went there but i never got the chance! I work in a busy restaurant on the strip and got off around Ten,i felt bad for my husband who said he was Hungary so i suggested we go to Metro for the first time, we arrived and we were not greeted,we waited and someone finally came over,the place was empty with one large party of maybe 8 and a two top,when we sat down i noticed how dirty the place is,the floor was covered in food droppings and our booth seats were ripped and our table was sticky,i checked the menu and was surprised at their prices,but i hoped it was a good indication that the food was good..... the Waitress was pleasant,we ordered a Hawaiian , but i explained to her my husband didn't like peppers so one half needed to be without peppers,and then she said ok without peppers but with extra bacon on his side and i said no,just without peppers. After about 15 mins,i told my husband i was exhausted and that we should just get the pizza to go,i was expecting at this stage the pizza would be almost ready.....wrong,i waved over the waitress and paid for the pizza which was $25.00 a complete rip off,we ended up waiting another 15 mins before we got our pizza....keep in mind we were the only people in the place ordering at this point. We walked home and i opened the box to discover we had no peppers on any of the pizza and extra bacon on one half.........the pizza was doughy and way to heavy on the toppings also lacked any flavor. So in short the service was bad,the pizza was bad, and the price was outrageous,i would never return,if you live in the area, try Cuigino's which has some of the best Italian food i have tasted outside of Italy and the family hail from Naples, also it is a fraction of the price!!!

 Don't get all the early hate on this place or maybe they changed their ways with some of the earlier tips. I came in and ordered a large pulled pork sandwich Memphis style and sat back to enjoy the military / family themed place unfolding in front of me. The smoker was in full tune and what seemed to be father and daughter worked on the orders coming in. It took me less than 6 minutes to get my BBQ meal so I don't get the complaining about time restraints and surely the food was worth the wait when it comes to BBQ options in Goodyear. When I finally sunk into my meal it was tangy with a kick and super delicious. Everything about the experience was good, and everything delivered with good timing and a genuine smile. I think this place will be a hit if more people swing by and the food is defiantly both good and outside of the normal. The only con I had was that I left the place after maybe 7 minutes and smelled like smoked BBQ for the next 8 hours even after a shower. I wish there was some way around this but for BBQ that good the juice is worth the squeeze. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This was possibly the worst Mexican and definitely the worst New Mexican food I have ever had. I am a New Mexico native who was looking for a place to get my fix a little closer to home. I usually go to Si Se \ u00f1or in Chandler - it is fantastic, but a 50 minute drive for me. At the Carlsbad Tavern, I tried the Enchanted Platter - a sampling of their offerings and the Green Chile Macaroni and Cheese. - Black Beans instead of Refried Pintos? - only in highfalutin Santa Fe - Heavily breaded Rellenos?- yuck - not only was there too much breading (breading! not traditional light egg/flour batter) the breading just plain tasted bad - The Green chile may have been Hatch, but just scooped out of can on top of enchiladas not the wonderful ""Green Chile sauce"" found in NM. -Sopapillas were served with your dinner plate! Right on top of the rice so they got very cold while you ate your meal. Not at all the nice hot puffy fried dough that should come at the end of the meal (see Si Senor!) - The only thing that was edible was the green chile macaroni and cheese- not exactly a traditional NM dish, but it was the only good tasting item we had here - Both the Red and Green Chile were flavorless - really did a disservice to people who want to get aquainted with New Mexican Food Bottom Line: If you are looking for traditional Southern New Mexico cuisine, skip Carlsbad Tavern & go to Si Se \ u00f1or in Chandler - that's what I'm gonna do!

 I never actually got to stay in the hotel due to a check in bait and switch. I arrived at 4:15 PM for a check in and after a 20 minute wait I was informed that I did not have a reservation at Nobu but my record shows that I am have a reservation in Caesars. I showed them my Nobu confirmation email and they then explained that they actually decided to move me over to Caesars. After 30 minutes explaining to Caesars the situation (and Caesars doing their best to accommodate me), they finally found me a king room at Caesars. I inquired if I would be paying a lesser rate for the lesser room at Caesars, to which Nobu said no. The Caesars front desk fought on my behalf to no avail. The hotel operations is a disaster, no one has authority, and quite honestly they ripped me off by making me pay the Nobu rate for a lesser room at Caesars. This hotel is not ready for prime time. Avoid it or be prepared for a bait and switch. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Great place to eat at the Phoenix airport. Don't eat here if you're in a rush, takes a while to get your order. Had the Brussels sprout salad; the sprouts are brined, so they were tasty and crunchy, lemon whole grain mustard vinaigrette, topped with cranberries, toasted almonds, currants and Manchego cheese - very tasty. The butternut squash soup was tasty as well, roasted with some sweet spices and thick and hearty. Their tortilla Chips are light and crunchy, great guac and a roasted tomato salsa. Other salads looked good, such as the baby kale. Hubby had the Caesar salad, dressing was very yellow, perhaps too much mustard, chicken was moist as seasoned well (smokey and grilled nicely). Good friendly service. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Kinda dirty, dingy, not great gambling, not great food, a place for kids, but I didn't see the appeal. They have lots of games and kid-related stuff, but I didn't love Circus Circus. Plus, the walk from the monorail to here was a half mile in the heat of nothingness. Forgettable. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My wife is Korean and found this place for us. Based on Korean blogs and reviews on here, it sounded like a great place. My wife and I had great food, unfortunately I can't give 5 stars based only on the food. The service was terrible. I have never been so upset from poor service and I felt like more people should be prepared for this. We barely saw our server and as the place started filling up, we noticed them seating people outside who probably would have preferred indoors (late December). We had chosen a booth which was big enough for at least 4 people, because the place was less than half full when we got there. Needless to say we felt bad for the people waiting. We were ready to go but had to wait, while people waiting to be seated looked confused and upset. I'm not saying anyone should rush to give up their seat, but we waited over 15 minutes for the check. Eventually my wife asked a different server for the check which arrived soon after, however, it sat on the table for at least another 5 minutes until I walked it over to their register and paid it. It seemed like the the servers were very disorganized and were covering a lot of the same tables. I'm not a manager but I would say something needs to change. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I decided to try this place located as you leave Casa Grande on the main thruway. When I entered a sign said seat yourself and we'll be with you soon. A lot of the tables were clutter with the dishes of previous diners so there were few places to sit. There were several people at the front of the room ordering take away. In fact, the take away line lasted the whole time u was there. Seems the locals know where they can get a good deal! I noticed that two large groups came in while I was here in an otherwise empty dining room which was ready to receive them having just cleared most of the tables that moments ago were littered. Perhaps this was what normally happens here ? Big groups and spread out so that the family running this business new not hire extra staff. Staffing seemed minimal but service was adequate. My food was average. Nothing horrid nor fantastic. Just ok. I will say that the membrane of the wontons in the soup was the kind I like best...thin versus thick dumpling . I prefer some thinner noodles in soup than they had but their broth was ok. This night they were out of shrimp rolls and did not know before I ordered and waited eagerly for it. Their fried rice was ok in that they put plenty of egg and just enough soy to make it light brown. The shrimp were large in the rice also. If you dine in, you can get a free refill of soft drinks and they did this without solicitation from me. I think this place is good for families and baseball teams and such. Not a date night place unless you are taking it out to one romantic destination. I would come back to try their honey chicken which seemed a bi hit with the groups on this night. ",0,0,1,0,0

 All my mommy friends have been talking about Pump It Up for quite awhile, so we had to check out what the hype was about. It took me awhile to visit because we had gone to Bounce U about a year ago and it was miserable. It was packed (they had a party, during open play. Stupid, or cheap? One of the two!), the AC was on too low so everybody was sweaty, the open bounce was 1.5 hrs I believe and my kids were asking to go after 45 minutes. I was like ""oh heck nawww"", since we had to drive all the way to BFE to get there (approx 30 minute drive). So, I forced my children to have fun at Bounce U. When we go to Pump It Up, we're there for all 3 hours of open play and my kids are sad when the person comes on the speakers telling everybody time's up. The AC is set to a fantastic temperature although the music can sometimes make me feel like I'm at da club (really really loud house music). The teens who walk around supervising are nice and carry bandaids for injuries. The price can't be beat. It's cheaper than every other indoor play place I can think of that doesn't suck. I also just learned about some program where they watch your kids for 3 hours for $20. They let them run around all crazy and then feed them lunch. The kids have to be 5+. Sounds like a pretty good deal. Downsides: Unlike some other indoor play places that are open all day, there is a schedule for open play. Check their website for the days & times. There was once a huge group of people who showed up at open bounce (10 adults, maybe 3 kids), and the adults kept telling my kids not to go into the obstacle course because they were too busy racing!! Super ghetto, and probably a favorite place for them since all those grown ups are free and they only had to pay for the 3 kids! One of them was wearing booty shorts that already had her oversized bum hanging out the bottom, and then was climbing through the obstacle course bent over, AT A KIDS PLAY PLACE!!?!?!?!? Perhaps a dress code for teens & adults should be enforced, something to the degree of... No buttcheeks & wear socks! Thanks. Last downside, this place was hard for me to find! I had it up on my Maps GPS, but Maps told me it was on the left side! I should have known it was going to be wrong when my son (5) warned me about how much Maps has been failing recently, but I didn't want to believe it. It is on the right side when you're heading West from Las Vegas Blvd on Sunset, and you have to cut off the random car lane on the right to get in here. Watch out for cars! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Had my HTC My Touch 4g glass repaired here and it was AMAZINGLY reasonably priced. Everywhere else wanted $80 to $120 for repair and they did it for $55. Not sure what other phones cost (sure it varies based on phone) but to me that was a really, really great price in comparison to the other prices I was getting. Of course I was cautious because everyone knows the old adage, ""you get what you pay for"". But to all, rest assured, this is a legit company based on my experience with them AND they were able to fix my phone on the same day, ahead of the estimated timeframe. They projected it would take 2 hours, but they had it done in under an hour. Great service and I highly recommend. Ray ",0,0,0,0,1

We had beers, an fried oyster app, a nice berry spinach salad and a eastern style fish sandwich that were all good. The only problem is the whole ordeal took an hour and fifteen minutes.

 Wasn't expecting too much for a joint near campus and I didn't get disappointed. I was looking for something quick, tasty, and cheap so I decided to try baja out. The interior is cool, plenty of table space and seats so not too shabby if you're having a working lunch or supper. The dude at the front was nice and polite. He explained the menu more or less; although, I could have inferred that their main items were tacos and burritos on my own. I did not like the fact that he charged more for hard-shell tacos, I don't think they're really unique and the incremental cost of producing them over soft-shell is marginal. Furthermore, the hard-shells were opened too far wide so it was difficult to bite into them. The beef was excellent though, juicy, marinated, and tender. The taco was also far too small, about the size of the palm of my hand. The rice and beans were delicious, very flavorful. The taste was good, but the pricing and quantity weren't completely there.

 This is more a review of the customer service than the alarm responsiveness itself, which has been fine. There seems to be a disconnect between the sales and the service. First, my sales rep, David King, will not return my phone calls now that the deal is done. When we did speak, I told him I was unhappy with the key chain remote I was given in lieu of a second panel for my bedroom. Initially he was accommodating, telling me he would get me the second panel and I could return the key chain remote. He toild me he checked with his supervisor and it would be done. When I called the local office to set ujp an appointment to get the panel, they said I could not get it and they tried to talk me out of it. In fact, when I explained the reasons for wanting it (my bedroom is upstairs and if I needed to override a window, I would have to go downstairs to do so. As a senior citizen, I wanted to be able to have them contact paramedics in case of an emergency since I live alone rather than just have them summon the police via the key chain), I was told the only way to get that panel was to buy one from the company. The cost? Originally I was told $150, then the price became $299 as they ""checked"" their rate sheet. I called my sales rep, David, to tell him of my experience and he promised to talk to his supervisor and get back to me. That was over a week ago and despite several messages to him, he has not called me back. Consequently, I got online to research additional panels from the manufacturer of my main panel and found the one I would have gotten from Gaylord on Amazon for $72.00 BRAND NEW! So much for fair pricing from Gaylord. So what must that panel really cost Gaylord???? What an exorbitant mark-up. Also, when the system was installed I was given a motion detector rather than individual window sensors. This device was supposed to be animal safe for dogs under 80 lbs to not set it off. I have a Wheaten Terrier that weighs 35 lbs and is 16 years old and relatively inactive. Apparently he kept setting off the alarm. When I called the company, rather than come over to try to adjust it, they simply said it won't work with my dog and wanted to sell me 4 more sensors (they would give me 2 for free) at $90 each (which is also available online for $60 each -- so much for fair pricing). When I complained and said I wouldn't pay more money and reminded them my 3-day right to cancel the contract was not up yet, they finally capitulated and gave me all 6 for free. I would have preferred the motion sensor. When I spoke to corporate tech support, they told me they could have tried to adjust it or given me a motion sensor designed for bigger dogs. The bottom line is once you have passed the initial 3-day right to cancel period, they've got you and there is no recourse for the next 3 years. I would not recommend this company to anyone considering an alarm system. All alarm companies do the same thing. So if you are buying a system, remember It's the customer service that counts.

 We went here the other night, despite the 3 star yelp rating- hoping for the best. Yick. The AYCE was reasonably priced- I'll give them that but- the quality of the fish was horrible. I felt like I was eating sushi from Albertsons. The miso soup had like, pureed snippets of seaweed and teensy bits of tofu. The spicy tuna was DEFINITELY prepared in advance and had very little tuna in it. The rolls themselves had very, very small filling and lots of too sweet rice. I think I am equally disappointed because its SO close to my home...I'm on the hunt for a great local sushi and...my hunt continues. That will teach me for going against Yelp recommendations!

 Nice local brewery and a great addition to the Neonopolis area of Fremont. Banger is a pretty versatile taproom as it can be an intimate setting for a date night drink. The mood is set with small tables and barley filled oil candles burning in the low light. Or come in with all of your brew friends, pull some of those small tables together, order a couple of flights, different flavors of popcorn and enjoy the spectacle that is Fremont. I've done both and it's a perfect stop every time. On my most recent visit I had a pint of Hop Bang Boom. As an IPA fan, I enjoyed this dry hopped brew with the grapefruity smell it offered. At nearly 8% abv I called it quits after one draft but the Hop Bang Boom is one of my favorite options at Banger and I could easily consume multiple pints of this microbrew.

 I've been wanting to try this place for a while. I had gotten a menu left on my door. Then when I saw that they are open till 2:00 AM on Fridays & Saturdays, I was so excited to actual have something open past 10:00 PM in this area. This establishment is .06 miles from my condo. I ordered a pizza and salad online, was charged a 'processing fee' of .49 cents, which isn't a big deal but kinda lame in this day and age of 'paying with plastic'. Also there is a $2.50 charge for delivery, which is the norm just about everywhere. It took almost an hour for my food to get here. They must be busy?? Pizza was really good, I will say, hot, cheesy. Salad was good too. The delivery driver pounded on my door and didn't say 1 word to me, just handed me my food, I said thank you, he turned around and left. Is this the reason why there are no reviews on this place? Hmmm, I wanted to give this place 5 stars but couldn't. Food is a 5, customer service a -3, so I gave it a 4.

 Went to Porte Grecque again reluctantly, it was my sister's birthday. This place was good about fifteen year ago especially when there were no Greek restaurants in the west island, somehow their food has lost its taste over the years.. The food was just too greasy, service was kind of slow. We started with the over fried vegetables zesty pikilia platter, made me feel queasy later. The Calamari was also too greasy and soggy. I had the lamb chops, scallops covered in bacon and scampi, with a salad that looked like it came out of bag and I barely touched it. Lamb chops were okay, so were the scampi and scallops, but I would no go to this restaurant on my own free will. My nephew loves this place, as he says you get a good bang for your buck. This is an average Greek place kind of on par with Casa Grecque, if that's your thing, go ahead and enjoy.

 A friend of mine and I have been going here for lunch for a while. Our tradition would include escaping from school/work on Mondays and meeting up here for lunch. The coffee is good, the pastries are great, and the food is excellent. They used to have this iced tea there (but seemed to have swapped it for something else as of late) that was unbelievable. We called it the ""Tea of Freedom."" It tasted like a promising adventure awaiting you just around the corner. Stop laughing! It was really damn good iced tea. But just as it came into my life, it was gone just as elusively. The owners are accommodating and charming. On slow days we would see him sitting outside with a demitasse of espresso and reading French newspaper, only to hop to his feet when we walked in. It does appear the prices have gone up, and they're approaching steepness for a cafe, but this is the Biltmore after all. Highlight: Don't know what to get? Ask for a recommendation.

I like my shrimp meaty texture (i.e Enso style) but theirs were like that squishy not cooked all the way type and I really don't like that. I actually ended up not eating my meal :-/.

We went in twice before digging up the trees and transporting the dead things back to the store and no one told us about this ""issue"" until today. Totally ridiculous.

 I came here to try the delicatessen food and that is what my rating is on. On a positive note this place is in a nice location with a pleasant dog friendly patio. The inside is nice and bright. You don't have table service as you order at the counter, seat yourself, and they run the food to you. I soon received my lox platter. The cucumbers, onions and tomatoes were nice and fresh cut. I took half the bagel and spread the cream cheese on it and noticed that the cream cheese was very thin and seemed like it was whipped and then thinned down. I tasted it and it lacked the tang that cream cheese needs. NOBODY ANYWHERE thins down cream cheese and it was terrible. The bagel was fresh but very odd to me because of it's texture. It lacked the chewiness and yeast-ty-ness that a bagel normally has. But the MOST DISAPPOINTING thing about this platter was the lox. I wasn't sure at first if it was the lack of quality or the lack of freshness about the taste. It actually was fishy tasting with lots of salt. After maybe three bites I think it was both issues and didn't eat the rest. This was the worst lox and cream cheese I ever tried anywhere. We also tried a potato knish. The first thing I noticed was the knish was very untraditional in appearance and was wrapped in puff pastry instead of the normal knish dough. The filling had the texture of instant potatoes and lacked the onion flavor and taste the filling normally has. The puff pastry was gooey in areas see photo. We also had DRY but fatty pastrami on fluffy mild thick rye bread. The pastrami would have been good if it was prepared properly as it seemed mishandled like someone just fried it instead of braising it for maybe two more hours with some onions to make it tender and juicy. The fluffy that lacked sour rye bread just was a sponge for the oily fatty dry pastrami. Lastly it was obvious that the potato salad was home made because the flavoring was a combination of unbalanced spices and too much mustard. Only someone without taste buds would be able to choke the stuff down. I was WRONG not to complain about the lox but my head was just spinning about everything. Old tasting lox weird texture bagel WATERED Down cream cheese not good gooey knish almost hard dry pastrami inedible potato salad Nobody asked us how things were and I didn't feel like walking back in with my dogs and telling them. I would be understanding if a relative or neighbor prepared food like this but I expect at least passable quality at a restaurant. I do feel terrible about giving a small business only one star but the truth is wild horses can't drag me back to eat here again. Oy Vay! Usually deli food is very filling but here you can leave hungry. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We made the error of showing up the day after we made a reservation. The restaurant was fully booked. The manager found a way for us to get a table without having to wait. This is not easy to do in a restaurant that is currently the hardest reservation in town. We had a great night celebrating my birthday. Thanks again to the courteous and professional staff.

 Best Mexican food I have had in along time. Yes they may not be perfect to some people out there but compared to other Mexican places this is one of the top 3 in my book.. Give it a try and I think you will really like it. Try there Mexican Pizza appetizer it's huge and you could make a meal for 3 out of it.. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We wandered in here because our bride-to-be needed to get her drink on ASAP and all she wanted in the world was one of those tall ass drinks and Senor Frogs delivered! We actually got all our yard drinks on the house AND the girl in our group was pregnant so she just asked for a water and they gave it to her in a yard cup so she wouldn't feel left out! And I see others have complained that those drinks were weak but maybe we got a special hookup because mine tasted pretty strong. The cups also have dare dice in the bottom which was a fun addition! The bar itself was dark, crowded, and full o' drunks which is to be expected. One guy tried to give the bachelorette a high five but her hands were full so he kissed her elbow. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The happy hour is great, haven't had a thing that wasn't super yummy on the menu. They also do wine tastings and their staff is really knowledgeable on wine and the menu.

 Pros: Great family atmosphere especially if you have kids. Food is always good Service is a plus The ambiance and play on theme. Pretty cool little joint overall Good customer service. I don't go frequently but when I do, the service never fails to deliver Con Quite a bit pricey In a nutshell, if you don't mind spending more, or for a special occasion night out with your kids, this is the place to be. Definitely not somewhere I can afford to visit regularly myself but I have nothing but good things to say otherwise. ",0,0,0,0,1

 As if this town needed another FroYo establishment. Honestly, the ubiquity of FroYos in the Queen City is something that leaves me slightly irritated. I mean, you turn around, and there's yet another FroYo having opened, vying for your love and attention. They're like Lindsay Lohan crashing a film opening, desperate for any sort of attention from you, some sort of validation, even though you know LiLo is bad for you, and bad for herself. Beat it, Lindsay. Don't you have a Porsche to go wreck? ANYWAY... Here's what truly irks me about FroYos: one, their ""yogurt"" tastes more frozen than yogurt. Two, the toppings bar reminds me of the buffet spread at a cheap Chinese buffet slop house; ""more is more"" means you're tempted to dump crap on your already-yucky ""frozen"" yogurt. Look, if adding Swedish Fish and Almond Joys and 4 pounds of three-day-old hot fudge is your thing, more power to you, but it's still crap. Self serve sucks. Yeah, I said it. I'm looking at you, Yoforia. And TCBY. You suck, and you know it. Thankfully, Pinkberry is the exception, not the norm. And what an exception it is. I've been familiar with Pinkberry during my travels elsewhere. I was also introduced to Pinkberry courtesy of a hilarious subplot in an episode of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" last season. Knowing what I know about Pinkberry, I was glad to learn there's now one not far from where I live. Pinkberry ascribes to the ""less is more"" approach, meaning the true delight is in the yogurt, not the mountain of toppings you're tempted to slather on your yogurt. Of course, there are plenty of toppings to choose from, but they learn towards the ""what you need, not what you want"" side. In other words, more of an emphasis organic fruits and organic dry foods. But if you still crave Gummy Bears, don't sweat, they'll oblige ya. Plus they offer Nutella. Yes, Nutella. Every topping is fresh, farm fresh even. Not that canned crap they (meaning the FroYos I'm hating on) probably pick up from their local Costco. As for the yogurts, they taste like, well...yogurt. Not that frozen, super watery crap that even Chik-Fil-A won't dare serve their patrons. Especially their GLBT customers (ZING! Couldn't resist!). I swear their yogurts taste more like gelato, tart and sweet and refreshing. I recently tried their Chocolate Hazelnut yogurt. OH MY GOD! Slap my ass and call me Cindy, that is one spectacular flavor of frozen yogurt! I ordered the small, and regretted not going a size bigger. Oh well, next time...a tub of Chocolate Hazelnut for me! Best of all is the flat rate you pay. Since it's not self-serve, you pay by what size you choose. The helpful staff will guide you into choosing just precisely what you want. I also appreciate Pinkberry informing their customers of the caloric content of their offerings. It's nice to know that a medium-sized cup of their frozen yogurt, with 4 toppings, will round out to about 300 calories, so you can enjoy Pinkberry without the guilt. Or the shame. Simply put, Pinkberry is light years better tasting and better for you than the FroYos that are a dime a dozen around Charlotte, and taste that way. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Have been there many times over the years and always thought it was decent food and a cool place. Went with my daughter for dinner recently and it was the WORST Mexican food I have had for ages, No chips were serve or offered. My chimichanga tortilla had the consistency of wallboard. My daughter's chile relleno was all coating and no filling, I can't remember now what else she had, but it was equally awful. Her beans tasted old and sour. The pasta dish they serve instead of rice was bland and really not improved by the stale frozen peas. I also paid $2 for less than a spoonful of guacamole on my chimi. I had a reasonably ok impression of the place before--cool environment, if a little run down, nice location and outside amenities, fair Arizona/Americanized Mex food. Nothing spectacular. Wow. what a let down. It may have been a bad night, but when EVERYTHING is TERRIBLE, I'm not moved to shrug it off and try again. The beer was fine, but for $40, I would rather go to one of the -Bertos's drive throughs. I'd get MUCH better food and a lot f it. May you have better luck, but in the area, you are better off with El Bravo or even Ajo Als. Based on my last meal, I would give this place NO stars if possible. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My friends and I were feeling adventurous so we decided to check out Z Girl Club last Saturday. I was a little nervous upon our arrival because I had been to the club before and if I remembered correctly... it was a dark and scary lesbian bar with ladies leering at you. Wow, to my surprise the place was completely different. I mean, it's still a lesbian bar, but that's about the only similarity. Upon entering the building, I was surprised to see a well lit sitting area with the MLB playoffs on flat screen TVs. The seating area is a waiting area because the bouncers will only let a few people into the dance floor/bar area at a time. So, feeling like fresh meat, we all stood and chatted while we waited to be let into the club. Shots were being served in the waiting area as well as beers, but no mixed drinks...boo. Once we finally were allowed into main area, the music was jumping and so were all the ladies! There were all kinds of women at this club! I was just amazed at the diversity of the crowd and how much fun everyone was having. It wasn't hard to be drawn into the atmosphere. We decided to stay for a drink before heading out to continue our night out. I wouldn't mind coming back to stay a little longer and possibly dance. Z Girl is nothing fancy, but it's not a seedy dive either. Stay for a drink and people watch! You'll be entertained either way! ",0,0,1,0,0

 This was a wonderful surprise. The wait staff was attentive and made great suggestions. They had the best bread I have ever eaten-raisin nut that was better than any other raisin/nut bread. Every bite had raisins and nuts and the crust was crusty. Absolutely delicious. We had a bread soup which the waiter suggested and it was quite good. Luckily, I ate so much bread, I wasn't starving, because the prawns stuffed with crab and spinach only came as 3 prawns on the plate and if you were really hungry you would come away hungry. For my mother's birthday they gave her Italian doughnuts which came with an array of toppings which she thoroughly enjoyed. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Someday, when I have a big enough office or the freedom to set my own rules, I am going to put in one of this dorm-size fridges and stock it with a bunch of cool sodas that you can't find anywhere except this store. Until then, I have to be satisfied with stopping in once in a while when I find myself in the area and filling up a random 6-pack of drinks. Just the chance to find sasparilla, orange creme sodas, Dublin Dr. Pepper (when it's in stock), ginger ales and root beers makes my mouth water. I still have a preference for drinking an ice cold soda out of a glass bottle and this is one of the few places to still find them. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Wow- I honestly cannot believe what happened to me at this place. I purchased 2 bikes and 2 locks about 3 weeks earlier, and the gentleman who helped me then was great. About 2 weeks later, one of the tumblers in the lock fell apart. I took the lock back in, with the receipt, and the owner (?) basically said that the lock must have been tampered with, and he wouldn't let me exchange a $20 lock after spending over $800.....really? He was basically calling me a liar, and when I tried to explain that it would be good customer service to exchange the crappy lock, he stepped up really close in my face, and said ""don't tell me about customer service!"" Wow! Obviously someone needs to tell him because he hasn't got a clue. He could not have handled the situation worse than he did. There are so many great bike shops in Phoenix that thankfully I will never have to support those thugs ever again. I would suggest that, unless you like buying defective merchandise with no exchanges allowed, to avoid this place and support local establishments who actually care about their customers. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Outback opened this location up in the mid-90s. The fact that me and my family have never stopped going back should say something. Outback is, essentially, an American restaurant with an Australian theme - mostly represented by the names of items on the menu and pictures/items on the wall. Pretty much any standard American dine-in restaurant fare you can find here, but they have a few other surprised on the menu as well. The atmosphere in here can get a bit crowded and noisy at times, but that's to be expected of a place like this. Wait times can be frustratingly long during peak hours - even calling ahead doesn't help much. Fortunately, outside the restaurant there are plenty of benches on which to wait, so you won't be left standing. The staff are extremely friendly and courteous - these people really go above and beyond what I see at most restaurants of the type. They are good about taking requests if you want an item done a particular way, and are very good about correcting any mistakes they may have made. One night, we were in the restaurant and they were packaging up our leftovers (which we were just taking home to give to the dogs anyway), but they accidentally threw them out. Before long, a manager was at our table apologizing, and even gave us a free dessert as a way of making it up to us. The food itself is some of the best this reviewer has ever had. There is a little bit of everything, and none of it bad. The potato soup here is to die for, easily some of the best I have ever had. The entrees fare just as well - try the Victoria's Filet with a horseradish crush, and you'll see what I mean. The long wait times to get into the restaurant during peak hours and the fact that this location is not open for lunch are my only real complaints. If you want a dine-in restaurant with great food, look no further than Outback. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Do not waste your money on this place... Bad experience ... I went to get my tires balanced and rotated and they couldn't get that right.... How hard is that?? I took my car to Toyota in Tempe and had them check out the car since it was still shaking and pulling.... They said it was out of balance and minor alignment and correct the issues for $40. Firestone charged $160 and could not get it correct... If they cant get a minor balance and alignment correct i could imagine how bad they would be at fixing real repairs...

 Wow. Just awful. Easily the worst meal during a weekend in Montreal, where the food is, on average, really great. Onion soup was incredibly bland. Watery and tasteless. Three people in my party got it and none of us finished even a quarter of it. For the entree, I ordered a pizza. Oh man. All of the ingredients came straight from a can and were clumped in weird bunches across the surface of the pie. The olives were barely drained and the crust was overly doughy. The waitress seemed to mean well but she didn't seem to understand how bad the food was there. And so she seemed annoyed at our lack of enthusiasm for the place. The management is responsible for the poor quality of this place, not the poor waitress who served us. The only thing it has going it is the location as it is in the middle of a popular part of town. We should have learned our lesson as soon as we walked in as it wasn't very crowded. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Awesome mom-and-pop middle eastern ""fast food."" The friendly owners are Syrians (the mom is warm and chatty, while the pop projects a certain paternal gruffness (in a good way)).

 BUDDHA BELLAY DELLAY! Now say it over and over again as fast as you can! I don't know how many times I've repeated that phrase over and over again. I laugh while my friend wanted to strangle me to death. (: YOU SHOULD TRY IT. It's fun! Now back to the important stuffs. The name is amazing and the reviews are equally as powerful therefore, I needed to try it. I'll admit that the pictures didn't really appeal to me and the pictures also don't do much justice. I guess I wasn't really expecting much despite the good reviews. When I read the menu and read each description...nothing awfully jumps out at me. So in the end, I just decided to go with the char sui pork roll, which was marinated pork shoulder with pickled veggies and hoisin sauce on a sweet roll. We also got their dragon breath fries as well. I like spicy things so my friend requested for them to make the fries spicy... and what did the awesome workers at BUDDHA BELLAY DELLAY suggested? To use their house made ghost chili sauce with the fries. And guess what?! WE GOT OURSELVES A DEAL. And they were good! They weren't as spicy as I thought they would be but they actually gave us more sauce to put on it if we wanted it even spicier. Eesh .. that sauce is GOOD. I really do enjoy the taste of ghost chili. Now, the sandwich. OH THE SANDWICH. One bite and I fell in loooooooooooooove. I was not expecting their marinated pork to be so good. It was thinly sliced but it was soft and tender. To be honest, I was expecting the usual American styled char sui ... hard, dry, and ... so on and so forth. Noooooope, theirs is nothing like that. However, as you're eating it, it will get messy. Now I definitely want to try their other sandwiches and see what other surprises they can give me. The service was fantastic as well. They would sometimes come check up on us and even offered us a different type of spicy sauce, which was also very good. It went good with the sandwich too! But honestly, the sandwich itself was good enough. Char sui does not need no spicy sauce!!! I think the only thing I didn't really care for were their house made chips. I'm a chip fiend. I LOVE potato chips and I could just munch on Lays FOREVER. But theirs? It just didn't ... appeal to me at all. The flavor wasn't exactly there ... I WILL BE BACK. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We showed up on Friday night at 7pm and there was no wait for a table. Sweet. What's not so sweet is the good news ends there. We ordered some waters, a cocktail and the Cajun Cheese curds. We didn't get our waters and cocktail until we were half way done with the curds. Not OK. Those things are salty man! My Pimms cup was served in a hard plastic that reminded me of middle school lunches. Classy. Our entrees were OK my girlfriend had the fish tacos. They were pretty spicy but nothing too special. I had the catfish po boy with a side of sweet potato fries which were extra $. There were 7 fries. 7. I thought it was kinda ridiculous but the catfish po boy was huge. I didn't know how to eat it. I tried to smush it down but it was still too big to get my mouth around it. The bun was hard and maybe a little stale so that didn't make it any easier... Service was painfully slow.

 I am so very happy to report, I returned again to try new dishes and I can once again say WOW this time I tried the following Wonton ,one other yelper, mentioned it was better than the usual fair, and I agree it was very tasty and far more interesting Gong Bao Chicken with peanuts -excellent again, a very nice heat to it, and again with the maple flavor, which to me was very tasty, the whole peanuts are a great way to add an interesting texture to each mouthful Twice cooked pork ,this was just good for my taste, the pork was a little more fatty than I liked, but the sauce and veggies it came with were good Shrimp special of the day , I loved the flavor and the portion was huge for just 18$, the only down side for me is that this is head on unpeeled shrimps so it is a messy mess, and difficult to eat especially while trying to avoid the deadly mounds of peppers and heaven forbid you should touch your eyes for any reason we reordered the sweet and sour ribs....a new no brainer so good the veggie if the day -chinese broccoli, just as good as last time New tips: I asked if they use msg, and they said they could make our order without, the only dish we could not get without it was the sweet and sour soup, so be sure to mention any allergies you may have as they are very considerate of these needs and can help guide your selection, also they only take cash and debit no credit cards Happy moment: being asked to take a seat while I wait for take out, having a waitress bring me some water while I wait, having the very nice waitress take the time to describe the dishes, and hearing the kitchen staff singing while they worked in the kitchen....aww to feel good moments of life, I'm sold on this place!!

 I came here for dinner one evening and found their burger to be one of tastiest I've tried in greater Phoenix. It was a Friday night and I started out with their Blue Cheese Iceberg Wedge (photo). As you can see it was smothered in bacon, blue cheese and dressing. I wouldn't even guess at the caloric intake for this cardiac arrest special, but it was well worth it. As for my equal delicious pre-ER meal, I ordered their Blue Burger for $14.00. My burger was cooked properly, to medium/medium rare with a warm pink inside (see photo), then let to cool to keep all the juices inside. You just don't expect such care at your local family burger place. Dinner ran me $25, but it was worth every penny. Enjoy! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Had breakfast at this establishment on Valentines day this year. All around a entertaining and enjoyable experience. Our server was energetic, happy, hilarious and attentive. The food was spot on as well, I am not sure the last time I was compelled to order a chicken fried steak and eggs at 10:00 am but after a little encouragement from our server I took the leap, and I am glad I did. I am not sure if they were the best ever, but they were very close. The steak had a well seasoned batter and was very good, My eggs over easy were perfectly prepared, and and believe it or not my meal came with three delicious light and fluffy pancakes. My girlfriend, had the biscuits and gravy and they were well above average, light flakey crust, and delicious gravy. Oak's is a perfect location for the home style breakfast of your dreams, but Oaks does not provide me with memories of its ambiance, if you are looking for eggs with a view, look elsewhere.

 I live in the neighborhood of the Newton--and have anxiously awaited the opening of all the components. Had dinner with a friend last night and we did all the recommended dishes: fried green tomatoes, watermelon salad, and the duck and coconut cake for dessert. I thought all the food was pretty good. I was a little disappointed about not being able to taste/find the sausage that was in the rice that came with the duck--it would have added a nice little spice. The coconut cake was terrific and a nice ending to the meal. The reason for the three are things with a little work could be fixed: 1. The restaurant is noisy--I think there is a trend that somehow the noise is supposed to be an indicator of coolness--it is a decision that restaurants have to make--it is loud but wasn't intolerable. 2. The service was just off--sometimes very attentive and sometimes a desert. If you are going to suggest splitting a dish that has rice--then by all means bring a spoon out so one doesn't have to transfer the rice from one plate to another grain by grain with a knife and a fork--Obviously we would have asked for a spoon had the waiter not been in the desert mode at the time. 3. Again if people are splitting plates--have the good sense to bring out clean small plates between courses--they were not offered and we could not ask because again we were in the waiter desert at the moment we needed them. 4. In my mind, unless specifically requested, an appetizer and a salad are two different courses and should be served separately so there is time to enjoy them. 5. We had a little bit of the pimento spread left over from the tomatoes and asked from some bread. What we got was something that was spongy and white on the inside and had barely a crust on the outside--I would certainly not call it bread. A restaurant at this level has no excuse for serving yucky bread--if you are going to serve it should be able to stand on its own as well as being a complement to whatever it is going with. A great tasty rye would have been wonderful for the left over pimento or even a robust baguette, but certainly not what we got. Southern Rail--I really want you to get to your act together --you are such a welcome addition to the neighborhood--It won't take much--but you have to start paying attention to the details.

 Thank goodness we didn't pay for this place either.... I think quite a few of my Vegas club reviews will start this way... I was excited to go to the Bank. I didn't think the Bellagio would let me down. There was a nice sized crowd outside but we didn't have to wait to get in, always nice. There's an escalator to get into the club and they were playing some good hip hop on the way up to get inside...a good sign. So we thought. Not 2 minutes later we're in the main room and it's techno city...and I don't like that city. We stayed a minute or 2 and decided that that's about all we could take. ",0,0,1,0,0

 BEWARE Do not trust the owner of this business. Mr Stu. Bloom picked up $12k worth of outdoor drapes from our house in Paradise Valley,AZ....we were doing a renovation and wanted them cleaned ... He never called to tell us they were ready for pick up...one year later. Instead he has been incredibly arrogant and not told us where the drapes are. After repeatedly ignoring our requests for an explanation, we are now forced to hire a lawyer . He has said he does not care and that the law is on his side ... We think he has sold or destroyed these items. This is a person that feels he is above the law ...He hides from the truth and does not care about his customers ... ",1,0,0,0,0

 Least favorite hotel in Vegas (Cosmo, Mirage, Encore). Unbeatable rates (i.e.: $69/room) if you need a deal but off the Strip location makes Hard Rock rather inconvenient. Loud, smoky lobby/bar. Would be fine to come party here but not to stay. Casino Tower - AVOID. Co-worker had a plumbing disaster, which flooded his bathroom. Another co-worker was prematurely checked out by accident, ALL her belongings were MOVED TO LOST AND FOUND, she was room-less until 4am on a Thursday. Unacceptable. Was originally checked into a smoking room in Paradise Tower despite clearly requesting non-smoking on my original reservation. Staff swiftly upgraded to HRH Suites. HRH Suites is nice and quiet. Stunning bathroom with smoked glass doors, fantastic lighting controls. Living room furniture appeared a bit worn, unfortunately. Bedroom suite doors essentially soundproof the bedroom, which is awesome. Has separate entrance, which is very convenient for hailing cabs. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Good pool, clean room, good service. From the other reviews I've read on here, it sounds like we may have gotten lucky with our room. We stayed for two nights in a Spa Suite and I found it to be very pleasant. The room was large and the bathroom had a large soaking tub with a television in the mirror. We didn't get a great view (the back side of the Luxor/freeway) but we didn't get a ""strip view"" room so I didn't expect much. They put a random $200 charge on our debit card, so beware of that. However, we went back down to the lobby and they took it off immediately and waived one of our resort fees. The staff was generally friendly and we were able to check-out from our hotel room. Take advantage of express check-out, huge time saver. Room prices similar to other middle range hotels on the Strip, not amazing, but not bad. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place is professional and a very good value. I had to get a denim maxi dress shortened. The style was such that the seamstress had to do a bit more than simply cut the bottom off and hem it, yet it still cost me a very reasonable $14. But I'm not sure if I would say they are ""fast."" I had to wait a little less than two weeks. I didn't mind since I wasn't in any kind of hurry, but it might be something to consider if you are someone who just can't wait to bust out those new threads. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We were looking for a place that wasn't super expensive and Mexican food sounded good. So we stumbled upon Yolos in Planet Hollywood via Yelp reviews. It looked great and my husband and I both being vegetarians liked the looks of the veggie enchiladas and the veggie fajitas. That's what we ordered. They were great! I don't know what they do to their veggies but the spices are amazing. The veggie fajitas were our favorite. So good. A little loud due to its proximity to the casino but hey, you're in Vegas. We would go back. Plus $5 beers (tall ones!). ",0,0,0,1,0

We have issues getting my 14 month old to eat sometimes, but he scarfed down most of his lil' willy. My wife thought hers was excellent too. She said it's one of the best hot dogs she's had, and she's from Chicago. I definitely recommend this place.

 So I'm not one to spend $30 on lunch... and probably won't be again for a while. I can't knock the place for my own likes and dislikes so I'll just say that the service was spot on, the food was quite impressive and the place is clean and well kept. I can see why so many people enjoy it... however it's not to may taste. The salad bar had a nice variety of options from chicken and pasta salads to a selection of cheeses and delicious prosciutto and salami. The bread and little appetizers they bring to the table were pretty good and the meat was hit or miss for me. Honestly, the dessert flan they brought out for a birthday was freaking awesome and probably my favorite part of the meal.

I won't be using their service again and would not recommend them. I would say that they were very patient and understanding when I had multiple contractors and movers coming in that day. Still after all of this was done, the cleaning was not up to par. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We stopped by Su Vino on a Friday around noon. We were the only ones there which made us a little leary but it turned out to be a great thing. One of the owners actually waited on us. My wife and I each did a tasting which appears to be a bit expensive at first (5 1 ounce glasses for $10) but after sampling 5, more actually as we shared, and talking with Maureen for about a half hour and learning all about their wines and how they started the business it was well worth it. The kicker was when our bill came (we bought 6 bottles) we found that they waived both tasting fees AND the cost of the three glasses we bought while chatting. We plan on returning some time in the future and doing a bottling session and making our own labels. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Best sandwich in vegas strip! It is not too expensive and quality of the sandwich is great! I would say this would be the best after-party-late-night food!

 I've amended my review to take out the manager's name since Jason D from Cobblestone so nicely commented that they don't have a manager named Rich. I should also add that the guy told me he was a manager, I took a picture of him refunding my $20 on my cell phone to capture his nametag, and I have my original receipt and refund receipt from Cobblestone - this location. I can provide pictures of those as well. Indicative of the customer no-service ethic at this Cobblestone location. **************************************************** I couldn't agree with other reviewers more about the strong arm tactics. I simply wanted a car wash - that's it. While I'm still in the car - would you like to sign up for our great value package deal?No I am not going to sign up for your package deal when I haven't ever been there before and I'm certainly not going to now! As I step out of the car - hey, we can treat your leather seats with a special condition for just $5. My response? No thanks, I don't have leather seats. Obnoxious sales guy says yes, you do - all Mercedes do. Um, no they don't. The seats are Leatherette. He says well, they still need a moisturizer so they don't dry out and crack in the AZ heat. I again say, no thanks. Well, would you like to upgrade your car wash today and save $x. No, I wouldn't and walk towards the lobby. I wasn't quite fast enough because Sales Guy then says we're going to have to charge you $5 more because there's ""excessive mud"" on the undercarriage. At this point, I've had it and say just give me my car, I'm leaving. Sales Guy says no, no it's fine, we'll waive that fee this time as a courtesy. Whatever. The car comes out - dirty, streaky, black substance all over the side panels. I swear this car had NOT even been in the car wash. I initially drive away but then get mad about my $20 so go back and ask for a manager. While I'm waiting for him, one of the wipe down guys comes over and starts trying to clean it. I tell him to stop. The manager comes out and says it looks great. Really? Why did your guy just come over an try to wipe it down? What is this black stuff on the sides? Oh that's just the tire stuff. I ask why it's on the side panel then instead of the tires. Long story somewhat shorter- I point all the issues. Manager says the car looks great and reminds me that they powerwashed the undercarriage for FREE! I ask for my money back. He says no, we can run it through again. I ask for my money back. He says, no call the corporate office (on a Sunday). I ask for my money back much louder. He says fine, goes to the register and gives me a $20 bill. Their sales tactics are disgusting. The manager was an arrogant, pushy 20-something with absolutely no customer service skills. I will never, ever get my car non-washed here again. I immediately drove to Danny's who did a nice job.

 I've had bad luck with the Deli at this Basha's. two time this year I've ordered a pizza and when I come to pick it up there is NO pizza! 1st time my order slip was found on the floor and then thrown in to the trash. Today's order, well the deli personnel act like I never called it in. I ordered a sausage with extra cheese and spelled out my name, because its unusual. They apologized and offered to make me another one, it'd take 15min. Well I've already waited 30min! I left to go to SPROUTS to buy a frozen pizza. Basha's pizza is ok. I get it because I believe in shopping local. I live in Verrado and I want to support local businesses. It's a WIN WIN situation. I called and spoke to the manager, Tiffany. She apologized and offered me a free pizza next time. I told her she needs to look at the deli personnel and re-evaluate their procedures for taking orders. She even told me when I call to ask for the manager and place my order with them. A manager has time to take pizza orders??? It's one thing to own up to a mistake BUT totally something else to tell the customer they never order in the first place. Now we call the customer a liar! I believe I'm done with Basha's.

 We'd been wanting to try NOCA for awhile and finally made it in last night. All I can say is thank god for the bread - when people say the portions are small, they're really not kidding! The kicker for me, though, is that in some cases you're paying full-size entree prices and getting what looks like a tapas size portion. Don't get me wrong, the chef is obviously really talented and the menu is unique - we just left feeling pretty conflicted about the overall dining experience. Apps - Oysters: $18 for five oysters - not cheap, but a reasonable amount to pay for good quality. I forget the variety they were offering, but we had never heard of it (and we've eaten our fair share of oysters). These were definitely fresh and delicious, but they were between the size of a dime and a penny each - about 20% as large as normal oysters. - Hamachi Crudo: Fish was fresh, good flavor. Comes with 4 small strips of hamachi, some slivers of citrus and an avocado crema. At $15 or $16, this is what you'd expect for a high end restaurant. Mains - Duck: Absolutely phenomenal. Perfectly cooked with well paired accompaniments. - Shell pasta with meatballs: VERY al dente (read: chewy) pasta with 3 meatballs that were each the size of a marble. The entire entree could have fit into an 8oz measuring cup, which at $20 is a little hard to swallow, especially for undercooked pasta. We ordered it without cheese, and it showed up with, so we had to send it back. Drinks - JR's Ripper and the Corpse Reviver #2: Both good. JR's Ripper was fruity and not too strong, which was perfect for me since I was driving. Really, if it weren't for the pasta and the fact that the restaurant was really warm and smoky (they had to open the back door to air it out), we probably would have called it a win and planned on returning. Now, it's up in the air. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I think my boyfriends dreams were crushed lol. So I know my boyfriend has had his heart set on a Tiffany's engagement ring for me. He's been looking at the online website, ALOT. He loves surprising me with a gift from there, he thinks the place is the best. Me on the other hand, it's nice but I don't need such a label ! We decided to go look what he thought I might like. It's always a cold feeling walking in, ( they need to calm down they just sell jewelry ) But a salesman decided to help us.He was nice enough, but you can tell he was very new or just a very awkward person. I kinda felt bad for him.. Perhaps he just knows the silver area a little better? He wasn't personable, and very non informational. He seemed to be just as nervous or more than my boyfriend! I had to get out of there, needed a cocktail watching them lol Well, I didn't care for the styles that were shown to me, just wasn't my style.

 I was very excited to visit on my trip to Vegas. I had planned on visiting a few breweries and this was one of the few on the strip. They have multiple locations along the strip. I went to the Miracle Mile Shops and was very excited to try them. I tried the Weiss, which was my least favorite..I just didn't get much complexity from it. The amber was better, but still didn't excite me. The stout was defiantly their best beer because it was rich in taste and body. I didn't get to try their Blonde. I was disappointed that I wasn't really able to talk about the beers and their style. This is the main reason I love microbreweries, you get to see and taste their passion. I probably had too high of hopes for a brewery on the strip. Makes sense why their was so much merchandise and no one too talk to. Next time I will go earlier in the afternoon. I will revisit them again next time I am in Vegas and don't have to compete with people just trying to get trashed. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I am rating My Sister's Closet based on a recent consignment deal. A couple of months back I signed over a Paper Boy by G1 button front plaid shirt, a tangerine pencil skirt by The Addison Story, and a beautiful 100% cashmere oversized sweater. Considering the quality and condition of these items, I trusted My Sister's Closet to price these items fairly. Fast forward two months. I called today (as I now live out of state) to if my items sold and how much money I would be receiving. The saleswoman first told me both the Paper Boy shirt and cashmere sweater had sold, then proceeded to tell me I would only be getting a little over $17 for both items. Hold on. My Sister's Closet gives you either 40% cash or 50% trade for each item sold. So, on average, they sold a nearly new cashmere sweater and a $70 shirt for roughly $21.00. The shirt is more understandable at that price, but $21 is FAR too low of a price for a cashmere sweater that is less than a year old and in near perfect condition. I thought consignment was the way to go when selling pieces such as these, but apparently I was wrong. To those thinking about handing things over to My Sister's Closet for sale, make sure to assess all other options before going this route. ",1,0,0,0,0

 For a place that has a hipster & healthy vibe this place is about as unhealthy as fast food gets. Food is still good but the sodium level in a half turkey sandwich and chicken noodle soup will blow out a day by itself. The order kiosks are nice but they are missing some odd options, I could add cucumber to a sandwich but not a salad? I've also learned to leave off salt & pepper after I had half a shaker of each dumped on my food. Other than that parking isn't that bad for the area, the people are nice and tables are clean. If they made more food fresh instead of trucking it in and upped the quality to something more than heating up a can of progresso I'd go more but as it is you're paying a premium for literally the same thing you could make at home with little effort.

 I need the 3.5 star option. Bella Notte has a pizza on special every day! The day we went, the special was a 8 slice mushroom pizza for $12. It was a steal!

Nothing to write home about, but a fun way to eat some green veggies, as always. The ambiance and service lacks. We wanted to sit outside, and the tables are right on the road. Just pray no one fails at parallel parking! Our server literally only brought our food out. She never checked on us. Not once. We had to get another server to run our credit cards.

 So when I heard that Spirit had taken over a department store in Metro Center, I totally flipped out. (Maybe you are now too, don't yet.) I made a special trip over to Metro Center last night just to check out this insanity. I mean, tens of thousands of square feet of Halloween merchandise? That's frickin awesome. The first major disappointment came when I found they had sequestered but a small portion of the department store at the far S end of the mall which I think was a Dillard's at one time. It's still probably the largest Spirit store I have ever been to, but it didn't live up to the fantasy I was conjuring on the way over there. The second major disappointment is that for probably the 5th year or so in a row, they have decreased the amount of decorations they have and focus instead more on carbon copy, out of the package costumes. They didn't even have a small section blocked off for black light and light up decorations like they have always had. They just had one table with a few light up decorations that pretty much sucked. I don't know how this place fell so far, it was only a couple years ago that I got a fiber optic demon skull (best Halloween decoration ever) and 5 feet long black lights for 30 bux there. And of course as I said the costume selection is pretty much strictly complete out of the package costumes that you have seen dozens of times before. Very little in the way of costume pieces to create your own. It took me like 30 minutes just to find a cape. But if you are looking to dress up like a slut this Halloween, this is the place for you. They now have a literal avenue for the ""Leg Avenue"" product line of costumes that seems to be getting exponentially larger every year. Looks like this Halloween is shaping up to be quite the debacle of leering and lechery. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This is good(ish). Salsa was average. Guacamole was average. Service was slow but not outrageous. But I did like the atmosphere. We ate out back and it was beautiful - I could have used a space heater, mostly because I'm a weather wimp. They have them they just weren't on that particular night. My food was good. I'm trying to remember exactly what I had (an indication I go out to eat a bit too much) I believe some sort of bean burrito thing that ended up being average to good. I don't spend any time really in Old Town or Scottsdale for that matter, but if is this the best they have for Mexican it will suffice - the charm wins it a lot of points and maybe even a return visit in my book.

 Today we decided to go to the Good Egg for brunch. Haven't been in years and today it reminded me as to why. v I want to make sure that this isn't a reflection on our waitress. She was very pleasant and tried to make it better, but couldn't because of the kitchen and the guy manager. Today we ordered omelets which come with potatoes and a muffin. First the omelet. Supposedly made with fresh eggs. LIE! They clearly use liquid eggs (most likely with citric acid added to maintain freshness It affected the texture and loft of the eggs when they cook). They omelet was paper thin, rubbery, and the texture was off. For $9 bucks, one expects real eggs. Not that rubbery mess they call an omelet. Then we come to the potatoes. Served cold and a few were even frozen. Yes FROZEN. My friend's potatoes were cold and some were frozen, too. So we nicely mentioned to the waitress who informed us that had happened a few times today. She promptly returned (about 30 seconds) with supposedly fresh cooked potatoes. LIE! No way can you cook country style potatoes that fast. It's physically impossible. Same freakin thing... Some where cold and a few were still frozen while others were pipping hot. Which tells me they mix frozen in with hot to bring them up to temp to serve them. Have they not read the current food code? Temp Control!. Our waitress nicely apologized and said hat she said something to the manager on duty. But at no time did a manager come over and say anything to us. We were then told how they have two pans of potatoes. One defrosting and the other on the cook top heating. We were actually told that sometimes when the cooks are in a hurry the scoop up the wrong ones... Really? Well I think that's another issue with how they defrost frozen foods. We then head to the register to to pay the bill (28 bucks). 2.50 for a diet coke (really?) 2.95 for supposedly fresh squeezed orange juice (that's lie) 2.25 for a cup of coffee (really? this isn't starbucks) 8.50 for my omelet 9.00 for my friend's omelet The guy took the ticket and said 27.49 (which was the full price for our brunch). I mentioned to him that I would like some type of discount on the bill because we couldn't eat 1/2 of our meal because the potatoes were cold and even frozen twice. The guy cashier said just a minute and got some other guy that was supposedly the manager (I didn't get his name). He wanted t know what was wrong and then from zero to bitchy queen in about 2 seconds when I asked for some type of discount on our meal. He actually told me that it was inappropriate of me to ask for discount. I was like wait... you served us bad food twice! not once but twice. The waitress even said it's happened more than once today. I then told him that he shouldn't be serving food that's not properly cooked to begin with. He got all bitchy and tried to tell me that I didn't know what I was talking about. I was thinking buddy, you don't have a clue as to who you're talking to. I was simply appalled by his behavior. Even minus the bitch queen tone with me, it was still not appropriate the way he was talking to me and trying to defend the knowingly bad food they were serving. I didn't say a word about the crappy eggs. I only said something about the cold/frozen potatoes. So Good Egg equals Bad Egg. Over priced, crappy quality and totally inappropriate the way the manager handled it. This experience reminded me why I haven't been to Good Egg in years. We won't go back. So much for supporting a local business. Next time we're going to Denny's or IHOP. At least the food will be hot and cooked to order (not just hanging out in pans defrosting). ",1,0,0,0,0

Salad of caprese, wonderful buffalo mozzerella and fresh juicy tomotoes! dinner was classic fettucini alfredo with broccoli.....so wonderful! great place i would definately recommend and go back to.

 Dinette looked so cute but was a big let down. We ordered an appetizer, fritto misto, which was really good. The zucchini flowers were crispy and delicious, the batter wasn't too heavy, and the portion was surprisingly big for an appetizer. And yeungling cans were $1. So far so good! BUT none of this can make up for how bland our pizza was. We got the grilled corn pizza to split (which was a perfect size for two people considering we split that large appetizer) which had grilled corn and brie in addition to a few other toppings. The toppings were scant and placed mostly in the center of the pizza, leaving about 60% of the pizza as just break with cheese...not too exciting. I can see why people like the crust (it was thin and crispy) but if there's nothing to spice it up it's still just flat bread. Considering the price of the pizza they need to increase the amount of toppings and make sure the entire area of the pizza has flavor. Adorable atmosphere but I'll go somewhere else. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Beckett's is fantastic! The vegetable chop salad is a nice blend of fresh local produce that hits the spot every time. My wife ordered the traditional french onion soup and it was fantastic, even for someone who doesn't particularly care for onions. The Pork Ossobuco is my favorite and it did not disappoint. There are few things in life more decadent and tasty than the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores. I would highly recommend if you are looking for first rate dining for a great price and good service! BTW--Beckett's is a great place to go if gluten is a problem with numerous gluten free options. ",0,0,0,0,1

 The hotel is really clean and spacious. The casino is a little small compared to the casinos in done of the other hotels. There are several restaurants throughout the hotel. There is a small half sized Starbucks and a full sized one on the first floor. There is a small gift shop in the lobby which was great when I realized I forget to pack a toothbrush and surprisingly it's really not that overpriced. They also have a Chinese food place that was pretty good for fast hotel food. I got the spring rolls and chicken lo mein and the portions were very generous. The rooms were very pretty, much nicer than the rooms in the Tropicana in Atlantic City. The furnishings were all bamboo and everything was white and clean. We had a gear view of the strip. The bathroom was clean and the staff was very friendly. I didn't use the pool but they looked gorgeous. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I had the occasion to visit here today with a friend. After reading some of the reviews, I had pre-decided on the grilled cheese sandwich with the famous tomato soup. I did peruse the menu posted on the chalkboard on the wall....writing so small I almost had to get on the counter to read it...but stuck with my original selection. The sandwich was nothing special, just seemed to be a mixture of cheeses on white bread with 3 small pickle slices. The tomato soup was a bit watery for my taste and perhaps about 6 oz. With the addition of a small fountain drink, the bill was just over $10. Would I try this restaurant again? Probably not, but it looked like they were doing a pretty good business with local traffic and the service was fast. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Seriously...listen to Yelp!!! I read all the reviews and still chose to order from them. I got the antipasto and a turkey sub. Which was $19 and took over an hour to deliver. The salad was basically a pile of shredded lunch meet and lettuce...I couldn't even eat it. As for the sandwich with ""fresh baked bread"" it didn't have the stuff I asked for on it. I had to add my own mustard/mayo and they put GREEN olives on my sandwich?!?! The bread was hard and NOT fresh baked...maybe 2-3 days ago, which I for one do not consider fresh. The delivery man was seriously weird!! He rang the door bell a whole bunch of times repeatedly. Then he just like lingered and I seriously wondered for a minute if he was going to try and charge his way into my house or something. Won't be going back and I hope anyone reading this doesn't go either!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I wanted to experience what all the hype was about. Went in to purchase a few pounds of medium roast, but first I wanted to try a cup of regular coffee. $3 for an 8oz Aeropress for what I consider average bean coffee, better that the chains, but not much more seemed expensive. As for buying coffee by the pound, well you can only get 12oz bags, at a very expensive price, I've experienced better Kona coffee for less $$ per oz. Do yourself a favor, skip this place if you want coffee by the pound and visit The Village Roaster, better coffee for less of your hard earned cash. Or if fair trade is your thing order a pound from here https://doichaangcoffee.com/ you will be impressed. Now I know this place does NOT live up to the hype. ",0,1,0,0,0

 In the most bizarre strip mall along crack alley is where you will find Harrie. I get to drive through here everyday on my way to work, so I've become familiar with Harrie over the years. I boycotted for about 7 years but recently started coming back because I was sick of Einstein's. I love an everything bagel, and what I love even more is when ""everything"" is on both sides of my bagel. I found that here. Problem is, their bagels are really hard. Really, really hard. My usual spread is onion & chive. I find their spreads here are really thin, if you were to hold the bagel to on the side, it would slide off. I tried the Lox spread and it was so incredibly salty, I ended up throwing it away. What I do love is the cookie case. I've tried them all, and they are all pretty damn good. Also I think their prices are a little steep, $3.78 for a bagel & cream cheese (did I really just complain about prices for a Jewish deli)? Yes, I did. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Disappointed. My friends had the deep dish pizza and said it was not as thick and delicious as the one they had at Uno's in Chicago. The salad they ordered was mediocre, nothing special. I had the 5 grain thin pizza with eggplant spinach and tomato, which was okay. The most memorable part of the meal was observing our waiter who kept a dead-pan expression and lumbered slowly back and forth from the dining room to the kitchen. He only provided silverware for the salad eaters, not for those with pizza who might like to eat ingredients that fell off the pizza onto the plate. Shouldn't have to wait and request eating utensils. We all agreed we would not return. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The service here is HORRIBLE.. First I walk in and asked one of the guy regarding my phone because the button on top does not work. Then he told me to go to the front and find a guy with the red ipad...WTF red ipad right? The while i was walking to the front, the girl that stands in the middle doesnt even ask what we need & just puts her hand out and says do you have an appointment? We said no, we are just looking for someone who can help us with the problem. So the girl says, you need to get in line to make an appointment. Which we did... There must been about 2 people in front of us. When we got to the front, in like 5 mins, she asks if we have an appointment again. Of course we said no, AGAIN. ""well we are all out of appointment time today, you need to go online to set one.""

 So aggravated!! Went to pick up our order today ( 1 dress, 1 men's 2pc suit and 1 men's dress shirt) and when the items were hung for us to pick up, the suit jacket was missing. When we pointed out the missing jacket the older male behind the counter asked me if I in fact turned the jacket in to be cleaned. Of course i did. First of all, I know what I brought. Secondly, the drop-off receipt clearly read 4 items to include a TWO PIECE SUIT. There were only 3 items in front of me. The female behind the counter stared at me for a minute as if she were trying to see if I was lying. Finally, the male and female began to look for it and what do u know... They found it. On the floor. Under the racks. It was kind of funny watching them climb through the rack, searching. The male picked it up and showed it to us, full of dust and ridiculously wrinkled. The male stated that because the suit jacket was too long (my boyfriend is 6'9"") for the rack, when the jacket came around it brushed over the top of all the boxes that are under the racks causing it to fall. The male offered to brush the dust off and iron it. I just wanted to take it and leave but my boyfriend wanted it fixed right there. Once the jacket was finished, the male hung it so we could inspect it. He lifted the plastic and there was dog hair and lint all over it from the beating it took on the floor. My boyfriend asked them to remove the hair with a lint brush or something but the male insisted that the dog hair wasn't dog hair, that it was fibers from inside the jacket and they don't ""do that"". Meaning they don't remove the fibers but they weren't fibers!!! Anyone with eyes could see the difference between fabric fibers and dog hair. I was picking lint and DOG HAIR off the jacket and was showing it to the male. I was so upset! The male did offer to re-clean the jacket but at that point even my boyfriend was DONE! The male did take $1.75 off of the $11.75 total. The main reason for choosing Oasis was because it was so close to my home. Now, I don't care if I have to drive 10 miles to the next nearest cleaner, I will never return to Oasis Cleaners. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I haven't stayed on this end of the strip yet, so it was fun to see what this hotel had to offer. Though I was only there for a max of two nights, I did get a chance to walk around to check out this hotel. Casino-wise, I'm really not very helpful with because I'm not a big gambler, so I couldn't tell you if it was ""good"" or not. It seemed pretty typical to me. I liked there were a lot of options of things to do here (Criss Angel, Bodies, Titanic and Jabbawockeez are all in this location) and that there's a food court upstairs for some quick, cheap eats if you wanted. Other than that though, nothing really stood out to me at this hotel. Same applies for the rooms. I thought they were okay, but at the same time, it is Vegas, so most time spent is out of the room, right?! :) If I was at this end of the strip, I may stay here again, but I'd probably want to check out other locations before staying here again.

 Went here for the prime rib special and to watch fitz of laughter comedy show. Both were good, but this place gets a one star for the lack of customer service. When my girlfriend went to cash out her gambling ticket, the worker (a 50 year old black lady) snapped her finger up in the air at her at told her ""i can't help you with the baby in here."" I understand their are rules, but the worker had a rude attitude. Her boss was right next to her and did nothing. When i took the baby outside and my girlfirend went back, the same worker threw the money out and counted it with an attitude and then walked away without saying thank you or anything.

 This isn't Beverly Hills or even Scottsdale, OK people? This is Chandler and Iguana Mack's fits right in just North of the head shop and a little South of the 99 Cent Store. There's nothing wrong with just getting down with your bad Chandler self and having a glass of white zin over ice at Iguana Mack's. Best things about Iguana Mack's: 5. No matter how I'm dressed I don't have to change or even put on make-up to go there 4. Watching the people of Wal Mart guzzling a margarita like it's Dom 3. Observing the weird dynamics of the frequent office happy hours that are hosted there 2. Onion strings....mmmm....... 1. DOGS WELCOME! Worst things about Iguana Mack's 5. Service really sucks....slow on a good day. Slow AND hostile on a bad day 4. It can get very uncomfortable if you make eye contact with a drunken WT soccer mom 3. All the bikers revving their motorcycles right there not 5 feet from the patio 2. Tables are so uncomfortable....I know its supposed to be rustic on the patio but anyone ever heard of a cushion? 1.

 This was my first Teppanyaki experience! I have to say it was quite entertaining! Our chef was very energetic, nice and a lot of fun. I really wasn't sure what to expect so it was fun randomly getting food thrown in my mouth, sake shot at me and watching my food be prepared right in front of me. I wasn't completely impressed with the taste of the shrimp or chicken, but the rice and the steak had great flavor to it. If you want to mix it up a bit, they give you a few different sauces you can try with your meal too. The staff was very nice, professional and accommodating. We had arrived late and didn't have a reservation, but they were able to sneak us into a table with another family. It was fun meeting a random family and having a meal together! Over all - A-OK place. Im interested in trying it again! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Say hello to the place that has the second best pizza in the valley (Bianco is obviously #1). I'm shocked that I did not know that this place existed and was very excited to have the opportunity to go here last weekend. A great unassuming building with a great patio and a small interior space, this quaint little place dishes up some great pizza. Thin crust with a wide variety of quality toppings (including smoked mozzarella, which is wonderful), the pizza comes out of the brick oven absolutely delicious. If the pizza didn't already hook you, this place has a great selection of wines at reasonable prices. You can order them with your meal, or order a bottle to go. What more could you ask for? The bruschetta was great, their salad was phenomenal, and they had one of the best tiramisu that I have ever had. Our server was very attentive and friendly (and cute to boot), the atmosphere of the place was perfect for dates and groups, and I can't wait to come back here. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Biggest dog track waste of money golf course in Arizona. They fool you with a nice clubhouse and mountain scenery but be course itself is beyond awful. Even in the peak season when grass grows and the weather is great they can't seem to keep the course in even decent shape!!! Dirt and ground under repair all over the fairways and greens!!! ALL YEAR LONG GARBAGE!!!! I've played here several times over the last 7 years and it gets consistently worse each time. Today was the last straw! I wanted to give it one more chance figuring the weather has been great and we got a ton of rain this year. Big mistake!!! Course was in terrible shape as usual.. Worse than ever!!! Then to cap it off, not only did they overbook as usual, but they let a 5-some with 4 women go out in front of us!!!! And they were all clearly beginner golfers with no etiquette. We had to skip a hole to get past them because they wouldn't let us play through.. The other 2 guys in out group went home after 2 1/2 holes it was so bad!!! Never playing here again!!!!!! And if you are from out of town or a local I suggest you go anywhere else but here!!! I didn't even mention that it's overpriced for a garbage course.. Should be $10 not $50. Get with it Foothills.. You should be embarrassed!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 We stayed at encore and decided to splurge a little and go to botero. it was so worth it! love the ambient, love the service, and their staff were REALLY well trained. We had : 1. half dozen of oyser -super delicious and clean tasting 2. fried frog legs -- love the side it came with 3. sea bass -- not a steak, but they took all the bones out cleanly, so no chocking hazard. very nicely cooked with veggies between the meat 4. new york strip-- came with 3 sauces, cooked to perfection (fiance thinks its the BEST!) 5. bone marrow -- love the presentation, and the toast and onion jam that came with it, its funny how the side came with a side 6. caesar salad -- very cute presentation, and they fried the anchovy, so yummy! 7. pork belly stir fried with jalapeno -- we are asian and we know how to eat our pork belly, but this dish was sooooo good! loved it! Over all every dish was delicious with great presentation (and surprisingly generous portions), loved our waiter(s), and it felt like an culinary experience. bill was 170 before tax and tip, wasnt so bad considering how many sides we ordered. for anyone who is going, MUST LOOK AT SIDE MENU!

 This place is really fun and apparently, the new spot to hang out. It has a lot going on -- there's large screen tvs that people can sit and play video games on, the old school arcade games, a dance floor with a DJ spinning and a very large rectangular bar at the center of it all. I like that you can just chill and have a drink or actually dance without having to pay an outrageous cover or line. When I went on a Saturday night, the DJ spun an eclectic spectrum of music, ranging from the newest hip-hop to even some Metallica. The bar is not as impressive; it was always busy and hard to flag down a bartender. The drinks were fine but nothing special. Overall, it was a really fun place to hang out, have fun, and dance -- and without having to take your stilettos or t-shirt with wing/ rhinestones too seriously. ",0,0,0,1,0

 They have a good selection of Fuente related cigars here....opus, fuentes, ashtons etc. The prices are of course high but if you are here already you might as well spring for something fancy. They are cool with you bringing your own cigars too as long as you buy drinks. I'm 50/50 on bringing my own cigar or buying something there. Most of the drinks on the menu are pretty good (i think i've tried all their mixed drinks by now :).... but their mojitos are the best. Realistically this place isn't anything fancy. There is a small bar inside, and i think maybe 2 tables inside? I only sat inside once. Outside they have a small indoor patio type area with a few tables. Tip: They have one hot waitress that works there, I believe her name is Alicia? I'm usually at Casa Fuente on a Saturday and she's always there. I've on occasion been there on a Friday and she wasn't working. Just a FYI :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 Have you ever hyped up a place so large that it couldn't do anything else but be a let down? Many of these reviews would receive ""don't trust"" or some sort of ""block"" tag if Yelp offered one. Have you ever heard the saying that you could fry a ______, and it would taste good? BBQ isn't much different. As long as your sauce isn't horrible and you don't turn your Q into jerky, it's probably decent. Don't get me wrong, I'm not about to tell you that Mac's has bad Q, but it's...just...Q. It's smokey...it's tender...and the sauce is decent. If you came here because you like Q, it means you've obviously had Q that was done properly to like it...right? The ribs are definately the star IMO, the pulled pork and brisket make me say, ""yep, that's barbecue"" They know how to make their Q and it tastes decent, but I'm not walking out of here doing the OMG dance. The sides are decent as well, nothing eye popping or mind blowing, but decent. The beer selection and atmosphere are what kicks Mac's up a notch for me. I love to pick beers to go along with what I'm eating...and Mac's has that category nailed down. The atmosphere is boisterous, friendly and thriving, while managing to keep a relaxed atmosphere throughout the dark and smoky establishment. Mac's is definately worth the trip. Come hungry and leave full. Try: The St. Louis ribs...just what the doctor ordered Avoid: The domestic beers (C'mon, you can do better than that) ",0,0,0,1,0

I would rate this place closer to 2.5 stars, just wasn't what I was expecting or looking for. Would probably pass the next time someone suggests California Pizza Kitchen.

 What can I say - been hearing about this place for a few years decided to go and it did not live up to the local reputation that's for sure. The place was jammed packed - I can't imagine why - Close by and cheep I guess. First the decor - dated, dark and depressing, stucco and vines, yuck. After we were seated we were brought a stale basket of rolls - dry and hard and must have been sitting in the freezer and then the counter for quite a while. We had the house wine - not great - but I'll take the blame - should have known better. I split an order of calamari with my husband who agreed they must have been shipped in from the Michelin factory - rubbery, obviously pre-frozen and the coating was flaking off. The tomato sauce served with was a little bland. I ordered the spaghettini with Puttanesca sauce - the pasta was overcooked - which incidentally is supposed to be their thing, oops. And the sauce, not horrible but not the greatest either. My husband ordered some cream sauce thingy, which he said was so-so. The service was friendly. Maybe I caught them on an off night. Can't see myself returning in the near future. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Ehhh, it's definitely a good value if you like seafood and can stuff your face silly!

 GOALLLLL My co worker and I lucked out, showing up right as mexico vs France world cup game started. I was excited a good looking menu, many energized fans, large screen TVs and a large salsa bar. The menu is in Spanish and the items are much more eclectic than your usual beef burritos and tacos. Out of my weak spanish skills I orderd the chillie rellno plate. $5.65 and a plate of chips. The red salsa was great spicy and a hit of smokiness, the green avocado source was great too, and the chips were quite unique. My chillies rellno while spicy, was a bit under cooked, and also seemed a bit grainy and unpleasant esp toward the top. This is why i a gave the 2 star rating. I also saw some great fun being had by the soccer fans, I am not sure if this is a BYOB place but some one showed up with a 30 pack, hey its 11am and it's the world cup! My coworker enjoyed his tacos however they were small and a bit pricey considering where we were. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I really had high hopes for this place and plan on giving it a second try after they have worked out the kinks. The space is great, the bartender was super friendly (dirty martini was delicious), the menu looks enticing and everyone's food around me seemed to be tasty but my calamari a la plancha was slimy and rubbery, my scallops were overcooked (but the broth they were in was amazing - wish there was more) and the salad was overdressed. The service was...awkward - the hostess sat us in a corner of the chef's bar and explained that we couldn't sit in the other open seats where you can see them preparing the food because it's first come first serve (??). But, given that, they're a new restaurant and maybe a newer cook prepared my food. Will give it another shot in a few months and probably go there just for drinks in the meantime. ",0,0,1,0,0

At least this one didn't require you to have a big gulp to assist in the chewing process. Kibbeh: not sure how long that was hanging around on the hot line, regret that one too. Dolmas (grape leaves) : best of the worst but really how hard are these to mess up? Came in around 8pm, ordered the above food from the woman at the counter, 10 minutes in and out. When we asked her if she would split the cost between two cards she said we don't want to but we will. That's always a killer thing to hear when you first visit a restaurant. She then proceeded to tell us it's because they charge them for each card, yes I know, if it had been separate orders you would still get charged for both. If this is the quality of food being put out an hour before closing you might as well close at 8.This place had bad customer service on top of bad food, I'm not even sure how everyone else is eating in the same restaurant. I'm still hoping Yelp will come up with some type of blackout button so that I would have the option to have this never show up in my searches again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I was expecting more from a place from with the novelty of being a club located on the 43rd floor of a building with breathtaking views of Montreal. Other than the awesome view of the city, friendly/attentive staff and rooftop terraces, I left less than impressed. Perhaps it was the weather and lack of people that came that attributed to the letdown I experienced. The crowd was a little younger and seemed to be just there for the sake of being there. This place most cater to either rich international students or pretentious college kids who like to buy a table service smaller than a desk for 15 people. It was seriously obnoxious getting around them. The music is what made me want to leave. It simply was way too loud and sucked so bad that only a few people were dancing. There was no rhyme or reason to how the music was put together and perhaps no strategy either. I've heard better DJs at a frat party. They had at least 4 guys behind the DJ booth and you think one of them would have been good at it. This place over-relies on it's concept than actually being a good club. I'm willing to give the place another chance and I'm sure once it gets warmer the place will be packed. ",0,0,1,0,0

 While visiting friends in town, we decided to get a pick-me-up in hot liquid form downtown. We ended up at Kopi because it was Dad's Weekend for the University, and our first choice was packed, with no table space.I totally wish that I could have tried the other shop, because I was pretty much disappointed with this one. I guess it was doomed from the start, when I was given the wrong drink. I ordered a Mate Latte, and was called over to pick up my drink, and it was a regular latte. Now, I am normally the person who would say something, but it was cold and drizzly, the place was busy with lots of people trying to get to and around the counter, and I was cranky. Whatever. I also wasn't too impressed with the Snicker-doodles that we ordered. Not bad, but not great either. The place itself has your basic non-chain cafe vibe, but it's so overcrowded with tables that it's hard to maneuver through. I guess I'd try this place once more, just to be fair. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The 4 star Yelp reviews are way off from my experience, there are some low rating reviews here and I had almost the same exact experience as they referenced. We booked a last minute room at the Trump towers to arrive at the CES show a day early (we previously had reservations for Thursday & Friday at The Mirage but there were no rooms available for Wed. night). We paid $404 for a 1,000 sq. foot room for the 1 night. I was impressed with the non-smoking policy, as we were bringing our son. I always stay at the Hard Rock Hotel but changed gears when the Trump room had 1,000 sq. ft. compared to the 400 sq. ft HRH was offering, boy was I mistaken to cheat on my HRH (sad face). Our room stunk like cigarettes and we were too exhausted to complain and relocate to another room. We arrived at 8:30 pm, dropped off our bags noticed the smell but left to have dinner and returned at 11:30 pm for sleepy time. Some items to consider - or areas that through me off. Parking - is only Valet Parking, this is a hastlle when you need to use your car to drive to and from places with children. Dining - one fine dining restaurant and 1 adult lounge (not child friendly) Location- hotel is located near strip clubs but there is a Nordstrom entrance right across the street. Hallways- the carpet is buckling, as we walked to our room, floor 48 was hurting to the eyes. Rooms- they are reconfigured condos, run down. I could not believe all the scruff marks on the walls in the white closets. The bathroom was very plain although it is completely made of granite, the glass shower doors make a huge bang when they close - it sounds like they are going to shatter in a million pieces. The ironing board was a cheap white metal model and the iron was a low brand you would find at walmart. They offer complimentary coffee, I thought they would have a keurig but it was a mini machine with self brewing (just very out dated). Sound - the windows are not sound proof and you can hear a train sound its' horns at the intersection near the hotel (I am assuming there is one) in the wee morning hours every couple hours or so. Housekeeping- our sheets had lipstick on them (not mine) Sofa bed- was a thin sad springy mattress, the one blanket that was meant for this living room sofa bed was rough from being burned. I'm assuming it was fire retardant as it did not have any holes but one corner was hard and crispy. My son actually complained, he never complains. Nice amenities Kitchens in every room 2 complimentary water bottles Free newspaper in the morning Free shuttles to Wynn and Cesares Palace - the driver will come every 15 minutes for pick ups to and from the Trump tower until 12 am. Hotel check in area is very impressive. I will not be returning to the Trump towers but am glad that I did get the chance to experience it. I'm actually dumbfounded as Donald hasn't fired the management staff at this place. I imaginarily ranked his attention to details as a Steve Wynn type but this hotel reflects a lower end hotel chain.

 I have driven by Drago Sisters on quite a few occasions but finally gave them a chance last week when we were passing by and my mom and I were craving a sweet. We swung by and the place was surprisingly packed for a weekday. We waited patiently in this very tiny bakery and were helped quickly. My mom and I decided to share a lemon bar and I got a chocolate truffle ball for my fella. The lemon bar was nice and tart but the texture was a little chewier than I'm used so I'm not sure if it was a little stale or not. I enjoyed the flavor, but my mom was a little disappointed. I tried a little nibble of my fella's truffle and it was decent. The chocolate costing was a little too rich but I peeled that off and I enjoyed the inside. My fella wasn't enjoying his truffle at all so we traded halfway through and he seemed tk enjoy the lemon bar quite a bit. I'd be curious to try more of the treats here, but I'm not in a big rush to give them another try since nothing blew me away. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Absolutely terrible. The staff was unfriendly, the whole experience was awkward and the food WAS TERRIBLE.

 If I wanted a sleezy salesman, I would have gone to a used car lot. But that's what I get for getting my first detail and not doing research. 200 dollars for a detail and buffing out scratches (that didn't need to be buffed out, because they are clearly still visible) I told the guy, Trip (after he upsold me on an unnecessary added extra), I could not wait a couple hours and that I would just have to come back another time. He said he could get it done in an hour and a half. Well, he must've actually meant 4 hours, because that is how long it took. The extra star is for the front desk, they were very understanding and empathetic to the situation. Definitely irritated enough not to go back though. ",0,1,0,0,0

 There is ALWAYS parking available... ALWAYS!!! Do you know how exciting that is? I mean, you're running late for class (expletive); you hit EVERY red light (expletive); you pull into the parking area and someone is going the speed limit (expletive, don't they know you're going to be late?!?!) and the last thing you need right now is to search for a parking spot for sixty nine minutes and miss your quiz that is always the FIRST thing your professor hands out.. well, good for you for going to West because you won't have that last problem. the stop lights and you being a procrastinator can't be helped, but parking is a breeze! ... I'm just really excited about the parking. anyway, the campus is nice, it's far away from everything unless you live in Glendale/N. Phoenix/W. Phoenix, but I think it's worth it because the classes are nice sized, and the professors (that I have had-- LaFond, Lewis, Foltz, etc.) are fantastic. but don't everyone go here please, or else you might screw with my parking happiness. don't. screw. with my parking. happiness.

 Sumo Ramen. Should have went with ramen? Since my friends were trying the ramen, I went with the beef curry. Big disappointment. It did not taste like Japanese curry I've had elsewhere. It was just yellow gravy with a tad of spiciness. The slices of beef did not help either. It didn't look like the picture on the menu. The ramen noodles do not look like authentic ramen, more like Chinese noodles. We also had the okonomiyaki. There was no description, but it taste like takoyaki in pancake form, a little bit of octopus. They also offered bubble tea. I don't think that's Japanese. As some other yelpers have mentioned, this is probably a Chinese-own establishment. The service was a little slow. It took a while for the waitress to take our orders. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Its Sugar, Its Sugar, Its Sugar; this is by far the most sugary sweet confections I've ever seen accumulated into one location. I dragged some friends down to the shop so I could buy my nephews some 5lbs Gummy Bears, yes I typed that correct and you aren't misreading I said 5lbs! They also have 3lb Gummy worms but I went with the bears; if you are crazy enough to want one of these monstrosities be sure to bring your own over the shoulder knapsack or book bag in order to hike them back out to your car/hotel room. The plastic bags they give you at check out will cut your hands up before you get to the end of first corridor. I actually went back into the store and purchased a knapsack from them to carry my bears since my friends weren't done playing tourist for the day. They also have a huge replica of the Welcome to Las Vegas sign made out of candy and it make a much nicer and often times cooler(you are indoors) photo than the actual sign at the end of the strip. Doesn't matter what you are looking for they have it or can order it for you. When was the last time you saw more than one flavor of Pop Rocks let alone knew they still made them? They had 5 different flavors the day I visited. You will not be disappointed with your stop here! ",0,0,0,1,0

 The first thing I noticed when I walked in is that the building is very well designed. So for architecture I give Z Tejas a strong grade. I'll be honest, I wasn't that excited to see this addition to the neighborhood. The Richardson's/Rokerji/Dick's Hideaway people do Southwest food about as well as it can be done and all are within an easy walk of Z. Neighborhood bar? I'll take any number of places including the Garage across the street. I'm just not sure where Z Tejas fits. The food is exactly what you would expect, pretty good, not great. If you have friends in town from rural Washington/Nebraska/Minnesota, this will be exotic and outside their comfort zone from a flavor standpoint. Arizona people might think a little... Meh. I do like that they section out their menu to show the vegetarian listings, always a positive to make things easier on the diners. The southwest slaw (I think that's what it's called) was one of the worst things I've ever had. It tastes like somebody took cole slaw and added all the black pepper they could find. I like pepper so I can only assume this was a mistake or designed for a consumer that has almost no sense of taste. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I'm very sad to write this update, but feel obligated to do so. My friend and I called Havana at 8:30pm on a Thursday night (5/12) to find out what time they close. We were 5 minutes away. The woman who answered said they normally close at 9pm but since they didn't have any customers for the past hour, they were closing in 10 minutes. In my opinion, this is unacceptable. We love Havana's food, but feel the service has been hit or miss for years. It was the food that kept us coming back. Now, I'm not sure we will be going back anytime soon. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Been driving by ever since they started remodeling the old Abacus. Got the menu in the mail and figured they've had enough time to have their act together so my wife ordered takeout for me to pick up on the way home from work. They've opened up the Abacus layout into one large room and added a large sushi bar across from the old drinks bar. It's well lit but plain, with little decoration. Only a couple of diners there when I arrived around 6:30 but it still took several minutes of standing at the unattended front desk before anyone helped me, and then a few more to sort out I was there to pick up food. (Is this a new concept?) Portions were generous: hot & sour soup, lettuce wraps, chicken salad, orange chicken with white rice were much more than enough for two but we wanted to try several things. Everything looked fine but ... there's a reason why most points on Iron Chef are given for flavor; it should be the most important element in every dish. I will say PG was remarkably consistent: every dish was pretty much flavor-free. Not just not the flavor you might expect from other times you've had the same dish elsewhere, but pretty much no flavor at all. No seasoning, no spices, no hot, no sour, no citrus, no zing, no interest. (Oh, except for the little containers of light-brown \ u00fcber-wasabi dressing that came with the wraps and salad. A few seriously intense drops cleaned my sinuses, but otherwise, you guessed it: no flavor.) Plenty of leftovers remain we can try to rescue with seasoning another night. I know it's still a new place and maybe there's kinks to work out. We'll go back some time to give them a second try, but only on the principle that one data point doesn't establish a trend. If results are the same I'd much rather wait an hour at Sakana just down the street. Good luck Pacific Garden, you'll need it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I haven't eaten at Mozza in LA, but I figured Enoteca San Marco would be comparable if not very similar to Mozza. The Venetian area is always nice..the ambiance was nice just to see people shop and walk around with the lovely blue painted skies. We tried the squash blossoms and it was good. I had the pasta with the eggplant and ricotta cheese and also the 4 cheese pizza. Honestly, the food was good, but nothing out of this world. I thought the price point was totally affordable.

 Went for lunch. Had great,attentive service. Got the artichoke sandwich and found it to be so-so. Just not a lot of stuff on it - mostly bread. Monty's Blue Plate Diner has far superior artichoke sandwich. I really enjoyed the coleslaw side though. My friend had the cubano sandwich and said it was good. Waiter explained it was made of pig jowls so it's leaner. The description kind of grossed me out, but I was pleased that he was so knowledgeable about the menu.

 Was I impressed with this place? No. Not at all. Why? First off, it was extremely hot sitting in this place like they had it set at a solid 78-80 degrees. Awesome :| Second...A burrito that only comes with pico de gallo and guacamole on the inside with your choice of meat is weird to me. Where you have to pay extra for other ingredients? Stupid!

 Wonderful and friendly staff, very clean, and convenient location. Jo was our groomer today and she did a superb job. I brought Zeus in for a deshedding treatment since he is shedding his winter coat and getting a coat more suitable for summer. The deshedding treatment would have cost me twice as much at his previous groomer but here the price was reasonable. Jo listened to my concerns about Zeus' ears. She took her time and patience with Zeus. I was not in any hurry so his whole process took about 5 hours to deshed the majority of Zeus. I was able to drop him off and then go do errands and things around the house and with all that done it was finally time to pick up Zeus. Jo did a very good job with getting Zeus to cut his nails. So bye bye long nails!!! We will most definitely be coming back to see Jo. I think Zeus has found his new groomer :-) ",0,0,0,0,1

 I know the peeps have spoken. I know there's rave reviews about this place. But....I'm sorry....it wasn't good. I had a Frito in my burrito. No lie! I believe in food fusion, I swear I do, but fusion with my snack food? Not sure about that. I think I'm bitter because it used to be an amazing restaurant called The Iguana Lounge. They had thee best seafood Chimichanga. They also had really great refried beans and let me tell you, I hardly EVER find good refried beans. But enough about the old...the better.... It's also pricey. You have to pay for the chips and dip (boo!) and each individual taco (double boo!). One tiny taco sets you back $6-8 bucks. Did I mention it was tiny?? I mean, I know I'm totally into American super sizing, but I can appreciate a smaller meal if it's amazing. Not so much here. I'd spend my taco money elsewhere....like a bag of Tostito's and ChiChi's salsa! ",0,1,0,0,0

 A year or so ago, I wrote a review after visiting Hula's that was not favorable. I didn't think I would ever give the place a second go. Tuesday night, however, another couple suggested we meet up for drinks there. I had been laid up for two days and was feeling better, so getting out of the house seemed really necessary, and one good thing Hula's still had going for it was that it was walking distance to my house. Another good thing it still had going for it was the drinks. So, distance and drinks in mind, the boy and I decided to give Hula's another chance. I don't know when it was in the past year, but Hula's radically changed their menu. There's still fish with a variety of rubs and some BBQ stuff, the menu seems twice the length. Once I realized the menu was so different, I decided I had to try the food, so I went with the Seared Ahi Tacos, part of their Labor Day special, and it was like a complete 180 from my memories of last year. Even the rice was ten times better. The other couple we were with had split a steak sandwich, which they loved, including the salad that came with it. I wasn't hungry enough to eat both the tacos that were on my plate, but I wished I was. SO GOOD! I also had the Hula's Hurricane, which I picked because it was the only drink that didn't have syrup or seem like it was mostly juice, but it was good. After a couple rounds, we decided we needed to try the scorprion bowl, which comes out lit on fire, so that's obviously a win. It's pretty sweet, but very tasty, and gets you in exactly the right mood to decide to go to Rosie's for karaoke. The service was an issue last year, and to some extent still is. Our server was really nice, but we had a couple of empty glasses for a while, and I hate waiting to get a refill on a $8 drink. A couple of times the bartender brought our drinks over, and he was nice, too. I'm really happy I decided to check out Hula's once more. I love the MCM vibe, and that patio is perfect for our 79 degree autumn nights. With the changes in the menu and quality of the food, I'll definitely be hanging out there more throughout the coming months. It really looks like Hula got it in gear. Add a few more attentive servers and it will be in tip-top shape for a Cen Pho restaurant. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Another location from my BEB 2013 journey! I hate Chocolate...Im just not a dessert kind of guy...especially anything chocolate. Id rather eat a fruity type of thing as a dessert. Im one of those guys who would rather save his stomach space for the main entree than consuming something sweet and sugary. So why am I giving a chocolate/dessert place 5 stars? This place made me a believer and lover of chocolate! Ever had that feeling or urge of wanting to convert someone to liking a certain something? (In my case it was chocolate). This place...geeze...where do I even begin? Let me put it this way: THIS PLACE HAS AWESOME CHOCOLATE! From the decor...to the presentation...to the creation...to the items placed in the freezer! Everything about this place was awesome! I was so against ordering something because I knew I didnt like dessert and that I didnt like chocolate. When the order came and I saw the presentation on the plate, my mind began be grow curious. Eventually, I had the weirdest urge and sensation and wanting to try it! So...I did. After one bite in...the doors were open and I was converted! If your ever in the area...and have any sort of appreciation for chocolate...or if your just looking for something sweet...this place is your jam! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! UNTIL THEN!! ^-^ ",0,0,0,0,1

 Have eaten here for years and always loved the food. Figured I'd stop by and grab a falafel sandwich and it was nothing like it used to be. Very sad the new owners don't have a clue. Also now way over priced. I played $13 for this with no fries used to be like $8-9 with fries and got it to go. No napkins no bag and asked twice for some hot sauce which is not the old homemade stuff they used to have that was like crack. No this is Frank's with water added....wtf. Then I asked the waiter why he didn't offer me the lunch special ( falafel plate) that was cheaper and came with hummus ? He responded oh I didn't even notice that sorry. It's alright food sucks now won't be back . I wish I would have taken a picture because compared to the picture on here of the sandwich this thing was repulsive.

 We had a reservation at the bar at 9:30pm the place was jammed but it probably always feels like that since it is so small. The outdoor patio is impressive but mostly their garden, it is crazy! It's huge and it makes you feel good as you know you will be eating fresh from their backyard! The staff is very nice and the food is great. WE had oysters from PEI, wish there were more choice but at least they were fresh! We were served cocktails from jar, original. We tried the chichitos which were excellent, and also the amazing beignes dipped in maple syrup with house smoked cheddar melting all over them!! Mmmmm!!! It was delicious. We didn't eat much because I noticed that the plates were overwhelming, meaning way too much food!!! Not the typical french restaurant portion. Personally, I prefer to try several small plates than 1-2 large one and feel stuffy. I will go back and thanks to Nic for the excellent service. PS Be careful, there is a bison in the bathroom!!

 After many trips to the Bellagio, I recently ate at the Caf \ u00e9 for the time. The menu is much more approachable and the prices are more affordable than other offerings on side; I still thought everything was a bit expensive for what it was though. I tried the BBQ Chicken salad during this visit. It was a deconstructed salad, the romaine was left as a head and was just split down the middle. You the customer needs to cut the romaine up into manageable bits and then cut off the inedible base. The salad had a bbq ranch dressing, but I didn't get much on my plate. I think having the dressing on the side would have been a better option. The lettuce was accompanied by a pile of black beans and fried onion strings and a chicken breast that was cut into strips. For $21 I was unimpressed, I think that the similar BBQ chicken salad at Panera taste better and is half the price. The service, like most location in the Bellagio was impeccable. The server was very nice and our drinks were filled and food was delivered quickly. If you don't' want to leave the hotel and want a relaxed atmosphere, The Caf \ u00e9 is your best option.

 The hostess didn't even tell us what was upstairs or that there was a back room. The back room had too few tvs for a place that claims to be a sports bar. The beef sliders were tasty but not worth the $ 8.99 charged. The napkins were heavy duty, yet I feel they could have spent a few extra cents & got linen ones instead. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE-you will be glad. A six pack at home is better than the sterile atmosphere promoted at Blackfinn. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Used to be a great gym, but management changed and it all went downhill. I used to go about 3 times a week and loved it, I was on team, had a membership knew the staff. After the ownership changed I noticed the staff change too, people were now very rude. Then I noticed the paths never changed, I mean like it took 3+ months before a new one was introduced. Next the bouldering padding, it was very minimal. It had holes, duct taped on some parts unsafe all around. I jumped down (like I always have) onto a part of the padding that was duct taped, in the shape of a pyramid kind of so the top was sticking out, and rolled my ankle. The staff told me it was sprained and that i should try walking on it. The next day I went to the doctor and it was broken. I was out for 3 months and haven't been to climbmax since. I'm sure if the management had never changed, it would still be 5 stars like it used to. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I am updating my review because even though the coffee is good, the service is really inconsistent. Conversation in the drive thru today: Me: Do you have a special on lattes right now? DD: Ok, so one latte. Me: Are they on special? DD: LAUGHING. SILENCE. LAUGHING. Ya, 99 cents. Me: Ok, I will have one with non fat milk and vanilla syrup. DD: SILENCE. THEN LAUGHING. Ok, latte with splenda. Me: No, latte with nonfat milk and vanilla. DD. Ok boss, anything else? Me: No thank you. DD: Total at the window, boss. DD At Window: That will be $2.63. Me: I thought they were 99 cents. DD: Oh, ya. That will be $1.08. Me: Here is $1.10. DD: Thanks, have a nice day. Me: PAUSE WAITING FOR MY CHANGE. DD: STARES BLANKLY BACK AT ME. Then, I get to my office and try my coffee and there is no vanilla in it. Awesome. So, long story short: 1. Professionalism/manners are severely lacking. Also, please do not call me ""boss."" 2. You tried to overcharge me. 3. You got my order wrong. 4. You did not give me back my change. Granted, it is two cents, but it is still my change. Even though I still think the coffee is good, I may start heading back to Starbucks. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I went to university in Waterloo in the 90s and stayed for a few years afterward to work. I am now in Long Island, NY but was back in KW to meet up w my UW friends. We selected JLB. When I lived here and JLB was in uptown Waterloo I had heard fantastic things about this place. But I had never been, so I was very excited about going. Truth be told, I came out a tad disappointed. Will start off w the good: Service was fantastic. Attentive without being overbearing, they understood we were ""reunioning"", and were not intrusive in any way, despite our slowness to order. Server knew the menu very well, and made great recommendations. Perhaps I am now a dumb American but I left an extra $50 bill for my che(que)(ck) and the waitress double checked my generosity. Very honest of her. Stupid new $50 designs. I have never really cared about ambiance, but the place is a little loud. The food was ok. Unfortunately, I began this review 2 months ago, so I can't remember exactly what we ordered. I do remember our general impression after leaving was that was ok, but not great. Overall, I am giving this place 3.5 stars, which is heavily influenced by the service we received. Breakdown: 5 stars for service, 3 stars for food. Ambiance, like I mentioned, I usually don't care about, but but it was loud. Fortunately Yelp doesn't do half stars, so yelp rating is 4 stars. ",0,0,0,1,0

 No matter what I always stop by here! My first time here was back in 2007 it was hard for us to flag a bartender down at first, then we saw an asian bartender with a mullet, yes a mullet but he ROCKED it! My boyfriend says, ""Ask him for a drink, asians always help asians"" HA and he did!! As soon as some seats cleared up in his area we sat down, we actually had a conversation with him, which is hard to find a bartender in vegas that will do that since it's so busy. For some reason I was undeceive of what drink to order so he made me some of his special creations. Because of Riki (bartender), we always come here to visit him and say HI and he ALWAYS remembers us!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 My friend suggested this place based on the filet and the singer. Well the singer we expected wasn't there. But the filet? Touche! The crowd this particular night, was...of the elderly/senior citizen type range. But honestly, it was kind of different and fun. No snooty Scottsdale bimbos or night club douches. Just happy couples dancing, sharing drinks at the bar. We sat in the bar/lounge area and listened to the jazz singer. Also a senior citizen! lol But again, fun and refreshing! He sang Sinatra and Dino and chatted up the audience. I don't recall his name. The lamb chop appetizer we started with was delicious! One of my favorite ""every day"" wines, Silver Oak Pinot was a nice accompaniment. They also offered us a fresh batch of ""potato chips"" as a snack and they were awesome! These were NOT Ruffles! Yummy. We had salads after the appetizer. The filet was very good, presentation of the food was very nice and the prices were reasonable. Probably $100-$125 minus the cost of the wine. Our waitress was wonderful. Very friendly and patient. Very attentive. The hostess was helpful in trying to let us know when the singer we were wanting to see would next be performing. So overall, this was a great restaurant for a casual cozy dinner. I wouldn't say you're going to meet someone you can take up to Pussycat Lounge with you-or maybe, who knows! lol But great food, service, and envireonment. Try it out! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Cafe Monarch's dining concept is such a fun and exciting idea, fresh organic locally sourced meat/seafood and produce with a fun and exciting new menu every night depending on their finds for the day for $45.00 a person. Simple and fun for foodies like me who enjoy trying new things. The problem with Cafe Monarch lies in the execution of their menu, I applaud the new owner Christian for all of his hard work and being a new restaurant owner is never easy, so if I were able to have a conversation with him regarding his establishment these would be my critiques: :: The whole idea of a set menu is fantastic, and working with people's food allergies is needed, but when you only offer such a small selection of items they should be executed to perfection, there is unfortunately no room for error. There was perhaps a continuity issue between the courses, I felt as though the meal didn't flow together and there were several missteps with nearly every course. On my most recent visit the amuse bouche was a taste of smoked salmon with a pistachio - it was kinda a strange combo, the salmon lacked flavor and the pistachio overpowered the delicate piece of fish. When we transitioned into our salad course the pork belly that was in our salad was over cooked to the point that the beautiful smoky and fatty piece of belly resembled more of a piece of beef jerky - it should have been the star of the course - but instead it wound up on the side of the plate. That evening the entree choices were a pork shank or a scallop. The pork on this particular evening was the real star - beautifully cooked, tender and flavorful. The scallops were both high quality and cooked to perfection but they lacked any sort of real flavor. The desert consisted of brownies which were so over cooked they weren't even edible! The wait times on the particular visit between courses was unbearable... We waited nearly 40 minutes between our salad course and our entree. It would have been nice to have some bread to munch on while we waited. They really need to work on the timing of the entrees. We ordered a couple bottles of wine which were great and moderately priced, they have a full bar, when we asked the waiter what their speciality cocktail was he recommended their Moscow mule. When we received the mule in the proper copper mug I was excited but then I tasted it - it was flavorless and lacked ginger and lime. The service was fantastic - our server was very knowledgeable and was attentive. Our plates were cleared in a timely manner and we were checked on regularly throughout the evening. The building itself is beautiful and rustic and they have a lovely romantic patio for those nice Arizona evenings! With a few simple improvements I see a long and positive future for cafe monarch but without any changes I can't see how the hype for this place could continue for long. When you're spending 150.00 for two for dinner you expect just a bit more than what you are receiving! ",0,0,1,0,0

 It seems like they changed their name from BabyCakes to BabyStacks, I guess to emphasize their pancakes... We were a party of 3 that waited about 30 mins when we arrived at noon. I ordered ham and eggs with hash browns and s'mores pancakes. My mom ordered eggs with seasoned potatoes and regular pancakes and my sister ordered the red velvet pancakes. My over-easy eggs were made to perfection, 3 nice strips of ham steak was grilled and not overly salty, hash browns were ok - ketchup had to give it a boost and my s'mores pancakes were disappointing. I was expecting something that was going to make my tastes buds happy and go ""mmmmmmm"" like how a s'more usually does... but that moment did not come. My mom's seasoned potatoes had no flavor. My sister's red velvet pancakes were a big flop; it was super bright in color (too much food coloring) and very lacking in flavor, if I was blindfolded, I would not have thought it was red velvet. I guess I'm a little spoiled with red velvet pancakes from Cinnamon's out in Kailua, Hawaii - which is melt in your mouth chocolate heaven! I really wanted to like this place but it's just all hype - I'll wait until I go back to O'ahu to get some real red velvet pancakes, I'm going to bring my sister next time she's there so she will know what I'm talkin' about.

I followed Joel L. recommendation and had the chicken souvlaki with salad, we also had falafels, hummus, tzaziki, gyro and the twins had chicken tenders. Everything was delicious and enormous, we had so many leftovers to take home with us. The flavor of the chicken was perfect. I tasted a portion without any condiments or extras, just to check the flavor of the chicken and it was delicious, perfectly marinated and cooked.

 If I could give Kabuto 10 stars, I would. We elected to have the Omakase menu and went with the big boy ($120 per person). I have had sushi all over the world, and this may be the best I have ever had. The definitely specialize in the Blue Fin tuna, and don't have a huge variety. However, the Toro that they serve was just out of this world. There are a few different varieties, and you get to have a lot of it. I won't elaborate that much more, since you don't really get a choice when ordering there. It's all Omakase menu, and you just choose between 3 different prices. This is the best meal I have had in Vegas (after working in Vegas for 6+ months). I can hardly wait to return (hopefully soon!!). ",0,0,0,0,1

 My, OH-My! This was my first visit to Posh and I can not wait to return. From the ambiance, service and cuisine this was a stellar experience. Nestled in a condominium complex, this wonderful 26 seat food bar gives front row viewing to the complex culinary skills of the kitchen staff. With additional table seating if that's your preference. We were greeted warmly and seated at the food bar. After completing the questionnaire regarding allergies and preferences, we ordered the five course plus the foie gras supplement and included the wine pairing. Each serving was presented to the two of us precisely at the same time then described in detail. The dining experience started with an amuse bush of persimmon salad. Then I was served a lovely salad that combined blood orange, avocado, chocolate, hazelnut and watercress into an amazing combination of flavors. Next was the perfectly cooked scallop with mustard, chanterelles, shallots and thyme. The third course was the foie gras that was a visually stunning presentation as well as being delectable. This was followed by confit of wild boar bacon, duck crackling with maple glaze on a butternut puree. A selection of cheeses was served as the fifth course that mingled creamy and savory flavors. A clever twist of a snicker bar made of a chocolate pate with cognac caramel sauce was the finale. This was an extraordinary experience and I look forward to returning. Thanks to chef Josh Hebert and the entire staff at Posh! ",0,0,0,0,1

 First of all, the bad things out of the way first. This is not for folks in a hurry for a meal. Wife and I were there just after 11 so before lunch crowd and food was a while in coming after order placed. Second, we were there for dim sum and there is limited availability at this time, and no visual reference for beginners. With that out of the way the shumai and guazu were very well done, and were especially tasty with requested hot sauces. Tried the pumpkin congee and found it lacking in much flavor. Also tried two noodle dishes and found them well done, with distinct flavors and ample size. Ambience is very classy and all staff were very helpful, but overall might be some opening stutters that might be addressed at next visit (which will definitely occur). ",0,0,1,0,0

 the food here is great. but the service leaves something to be desired. we called ahead with a party of 10 at noon on a sunday -- they said it would be no problem. when we got there, there was one server on the floor and she apparently couldn't keep up. we got our own silverware, condiments and refills. when we expressed displeasure to the owner, he told us the server was overworked -- but he wasn't all that polite about it. (and anyway, isn't that his fault?) it should also be noted that he was behind the sparsely-seated bar the entire time and didn't seem to be helping her at all. he apologized and put in an order for free dessert. we weren't in the mood to sit there longer -- we had already been there for two hours -- so when we passed on dessert, the owner got pissy. i would have called someone else to complain, but there isn't much you can do when even the owner is rude to you. anyway. go for the food, but consider getting it to go.

 4.5 stars I've noticed some of the reviews stated the service wasn't all that great. I can tell you from our dining experience, it was fantastic. From start to finish the staff were great... no issues... and very informative. The food... If you haven't been to Spago, they have two menus. One is for fine dining, the other is for casual dining. We went the fine dining route. I had the beef tar tare (a first for me) and it was delicious. My wife tried it and loved it as well. She had the white asparagus special. Another winner of a dish. Main course... I had the American Wagyu steak, it was served on a bed of spinach and mushrooms. The side dish was a semolina fondue with black truffle. The steak... it was sous vide @135 degrees for 72 hours. It's hard to describe how amazing the steak was. It melted in your mouth like pork belly but with a great steak flavor. I was able to cut it with my fork. The texture and how it melts in your mouth is nothing short of amazing. I highly recommend you order this steak. Best steak I've had to date. My wife had the roasted chicken with goat cheese which was on mashed potatoes and brown gravy. Comfort food galore! I tried it... loved it... she loved the meal as well. Deserts... I had chocolate bread pudding which also had passion fruit. This is where 1/2 a star was deducted. I thought the desert was tiny and the passion fruit didn't go well with the rest of the dish. My wife had a peanut butter souffle. Another great dish... well worth ordering. All in all we had a fantastic dinner with great food and great service. I would highly recommend you give this place a try. Do order the steak I mentioned... it's simply fantastic. A couple of drinks, a few bottles of water, appetizers, main course, desert = $240+$40 tip $280 total. (ouch) but tasty. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ok, so I've been a Yelp! user for a while now and have been meaning to actually write my first review. Since this is a new business (that I love) I figure what better opportunity could I have?? Not only will it be my first review but also my first- first review of a new business! Enough rambling, lets get down to the nitty gritty... Diya's Eyebrow Threading is located on Lake Mead and Rock Springs in the same parking lot as Chipotle. It's a small place, easy to miss if you're not really looking for the sign. This is a new location of an existing business- they have another location on West Sahara (even easier to miss). I found this place because I went to their old location to get my eyebrows done and was told my favorite threader was at their new location. I'm crazy picky about straying from people I like when it comes to my hair or face so off exploring I went. The lot where its located is cute- theres a few places to grab food if you're hungry and a couple other little interesting stores. One thing I did notice was the parking can be a little scarce if you go during a weekend or a later time of day. When I walked in I noticed you can definitely tell the place was new- it lacked a little decoration- but I thought was what there so far was great. I recall there being some nice little couches and the capes they use to keep the hair from falling on you were leopard print! Very cute! When I walked in I was immediately greeted with a friendly smile by Cassie (the best threader ever) and her husband who was there helping her with some things. She sat me down, did her thing- great as always, and I was in and out within a few minutes. Even better is since this location has only been open for a short time (maybe a couple weeks) so they currently have a Grand Opening special- Eyebrow threading for $7! What a steal! Now the thing I want to warn about right off the bat is this is a very new location- and as far as I know they currently only have Cassie working there and only until about 8 pm when they close, she then heads over to their old location. I'm sure they're going to be staffing more as it gets busier but I would keep this in mind and maybe call ahead of time just in case you're in a hurry. ",0,0,0,0,1

 It's more like a 3.5 star rating. As it is with Cirque shows, there just seems to be a lot of random stuff going on. I didn't notice a storyline (so far only KA has one), which is pretty normal for a Cirque show. I definitely wouldn't put this on the top of my Vegas Cirque shows. I noticed that one act from KA wasn't in this showing (even though I see a picture of it here on yelp) and a co-worker had told me about it. So maybe they're changing it each time or something. *shrugs* Not too much stood out to me in this show so it's just okay. For now, at least. Who knows what will be changed in the future. I've seen all the Vegas Cirque shows... 1. KA (MGM) 2. Mystere (TI) 3. ""O"" (Bellagio) 4. Michael Jackson Immortals 5. LOVE (Mirage) 6. Viva Elvis (Aria) *gone 7. Zumanity (NYNY) 8.

 Let me preface this by saying this place is going downhill. It's gotten pretty seedy lately with lots of unsavory characters and trolls sitting at the bar. Like drug scene and shady, but if you are into that, have at it. I ain't judgin' you, just not my thing. The DJ's here are usually pretty good, so that's good if you want to dance, yet the dance floor is quite tiny. It's somewhat difficult to get served here unless it's the guy bartender with glasses and a baseball cap. He's very attentive, the rest are either snobby or indifferent to your existence and mine clearly. I'll tell you a story, last month I stopped in (even though someone that used to work there said it's no good and scary now) for a drink, and well, I did not get a drink. I wanted a drink, I was thirsty, but the bartender was too busy chatting, then getting on her smartphone to wait on me. Some guy came from behind the bar and I asked him if he'd wait on me and he said, ""ummm...I'd help you, but she doesnt want me messing with her drawer."" So, that's it. no more remedy for me.

 Our visit to this restaurant has been the only black smudge on our trip to Montreal. We had been recommended this place by our hotel. The food was extremely low quality. I got a steak which was so clearly frozen and of poor quality that I could I gotten it at a diner in Florida for $6.50. Everything seemed to have been frozen at some point and was way way way overpriced for the poor quality. There was weird techno music playing in the background. On top of it, I had ordered off a set menu, but then was charged regular menu price. When I pointed it out to the waiter, he claimed I had said the wrong thing in French. I had clearly pointed to the set menu on the English side of the menu when I ordered. But the way he responded to me when I raised it to him left me somehow apologizing to him for the mistake. The waiter served to make me embarrassed and then bitter that I was overcharged. This is the only time I've been made to feel unwelcome as a tourist during my time in Montreal. The only redeeming quality was the small glass of kir and champagne they offered women upon being seated. Our bill came to $90 and was the quality of a $15 diner. Definitely avoid it here.

 I am giving this place a 1 star rating because the only thing good was the food and it was served practically cold!

 So we are trying to find a sushi place and walk by the Imperial Palace Casino cause we see a sign for this place. Right away I wasnt feeling it, but the group I was with was desperate and hungry. *sigh* After asking where the place is, we had up to the 4th or 5th floor. The place is nearly deserted. Only 2 people are there and you'd think they were gettin ready to close. After getting seated we order some sodas. I ask for Diet Pepsi, in which they bring me a glass of ice and a CAN of Diet Pepsi.. $3 FRIGGING Dollars. Are you kidding me? I can nearly by a 12-pack for that much. What a rip off. After going through the menu and realizing this is not a real sushi place, we all decide to not eat there.

 I love this Smiths. I've shopped here many, many times, the store lay out is great and very convenient and there's ALWAYS plenty of 10 for $10 deals, a Smiths staple. The bread, condiments, canned foods, etc are located pretty direct to where the entrance is, same for the current best deals, the Starbucks mini cafe, and the vegetables and such. Very convenient for when you need to run in, grab something, and then run back home to food cooking. They have all the ""health foods"" and organic stuff in it's own section right next to the bakery/deli and the alcohol section which is also on the side of the store closest to the door. Again, super convenient. This smith's location also happens to be one where you can bag your own granola, flax seeds, cranberries, etc. This is a section that I have yet to see at any Smiths store or grocery store other than Whole Foods. They also have City Life placed by the exit, a favorite of mine which I definitely prefer picking up on a grocery store trip rather than going inside a gas station. And speaking of gas stations, this location has a Smiths gas station out in the parking lot with plenty of pumps. So you can go shop, win big on the deals, and then go out and cash in your Smiths points at the pump. One time when I came to fill up they took a dollar off the price per gallon because I had so many points on my card. I also remember coming in late one night and a crew was actually filming at one of the registers with the whole lights set up and everything. Seriously, this grocery store is very cool! I've never really felt excited about going to a grocery store but this one makes my life so much easier than I would expect it to! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Ok so I joined just last week but it seems cool so far. I liked the fact I didn't have to sign a long term contract. I can give a 60 day notice and I'm done. The facilities are nice and well kept. Staff seems friendly and offer assistance but they're not pushy. Too bad they don't have a pool but then the cost would probably be higher. I'm very pleased with Lifestyle so far. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Recently, I found myself in downtown Mesa looking for a place to sit an write a while while my son went to a concert - I had 4-5 hours to kill. I planned visiting one of the coffee houses within a 5 mile radius but my lack of familiarity with Mesa made that a disagreeable prospect. Fortunately, I noticed Lo-Fi Coffee, which was literally part of the concert venue building, before I began my trek. Lo-Fi was a comfortable place that served good coffee. But what made me a fan of Lo-Fi was the barista, an Air force vet who was friendly and went out of his way to make me comfortable (they closed at 9 and he let me sit in until 9:30 - concert lasted until midnight). If I lived closer, or if Lo-Fi opened shop nearer where i live, I would go back again. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I wish I could leave negative stars. This establishment is by far the worst fast food restaurant I've ever been in - and I've been in a lot. The employees here clearly hate their jobs. I always hope it would change, because let's face it, sometimes you want a dang Whopper. That was the case for me tonight. I walk in - hear the door chime to alert people I was there. I stood at the empty counter and waited. No one shows up. So I shift a little bit since there's an employee there washing trays. She makes eye contact with me then quickly looks away. I wait a few minutes longer. So after more than 5 minutes of waiting to have my order taken... I just decided to leave. This is not the first bad experience I've had here. It's gone through a few management changes over the past few years, I always thought the service would change... but it never has. Their slogan is ""have it your way"", so why is that me, as a customer, asking for the fries to be cooked longer is mocked by the manager? DO YOU THINK WE CAN'T HEAR YOU? Additionally, please know that just because a person looks a certain ethnicity doesn't mean we don't understand Spanish ;) The floors are almost always sticky. The trash usually overflows. It's just horribly ran. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I'm sad to say, I really didn't enjoy most of my visit here. I've had many reccommendations to go here, there was a lot of people waiting, and the amount of reviews are impressive so maybe at one point they were really good but tonight, I didn't like the majority of the sushi I tasted. The service was great, everyone was friendly, all the waitresses made sure drinks were never empty, and Victor at the sushi bar was really nice and attentive. However, the sushi was just not on point. The sun of the beach and wet roll tasted kinda good but each were drenched in delicious spicy mayo and some other sauce. I took the sauce off with by napkin and the sushi was hard to swallow. Fish was really mushy and not too fresh. Super white tuna is one of my favorites usually so I ordered 2 pieces just to try it and the cut was massive, chunky, definitely not melt in your mouth and the ponzu sauce that they drenched it in wasn't even that good. It was mushy and had a weird taste. Overall the sushi taste I would say has been the worst I've had in Vegas. I'm really not trying to sound harsh but I really didn't not enjoy it. They have many different rolls however if you look closely, they are all very similar. I think I only saw one roll with scallops, I didn't see any impressive sauces, the only different sauce I saw was on the ""OH DAM!!!!HENRY"" roll. I was iffy to try the green mussels since the grade of sushi had been not too great. Desert was great but since they don't make it in house, I can't really add another star just cause of ice cream. Overall, the service is great but sadly the sushi not so much. My favorite is still Kaya Sushi and Goyemon. Sorry Yama Sushi! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Did an outstanding job on refinishing a set of OZ Superleggera's that had been neglected. The finish looks great and the machine cut faces really compliment the dark gray powder coat. They had already coated a turbo outlet piece for me with the same outstanding results. The only complaint I have is timely correspondence when things are complete.

 I visited Charlotte and went to the Breakfast club with some locals. I was very impressed with the music, being a child of the 80s myself. That part was great. People watching there was a hoot! I mean, there HAD TO BE a Star Trek convention or a Bill Gates seminar somewhere in the area. I have NEVER seen so many dorks in my life! Maybe the cast of Revenge of the Nerds had a reunion? I'm not sure, but it was super funny! And NONE of them could dance. I laughed my ass off at all of them! I could have sold pocket protectors in the parking lot and made a fortune! As a happily married woman, in no way was I there to meet men, but woe to the girls who are trying to hook up! (Of course, the girls were a bit nerdy, too!) Oh, and the people who were in the least bit trendy and coordinated were gay! So, if NONE of that bothers you, you'll have a blast here! The Breakfast Club's motto ought to be ""Where the ugly go to get laid!"" LOL! I did have a good time there... Dancing to the 80s music was fun. People watching was fun! I would definitely go back!

 As much i wanted to love this store more than any other filipino grocery stores, i just can't. Okay, my mom loves to buy bibingka, and any other cooked food at Manila Sunset (?) which is inside the grocery store. Whenever we're around the complex, she has to make sure she buys something from there. The grocery? You can't go wrong, it is huge! I think it's as huge as Seafood City! Lots of selection. But this place is dead...i mean, there are no people shopping. I always think that this place would close any time soon, although this place is not really hard to find. So one time i went here to grab a couple snacks to bring with me on a road trip. So i decided to buy a LOT of filipino chips. Much to my surprise, all the snacks tasted horrible! They were OLD! I can't believe i never realized that since the place is such a ghost town, of course, nobody would shop there, and they still keep their food eventhough it's been sitting there for a while. NEVER ever gonna shop there again! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Best chips and salsa in town! However, there's something funny with the guac (I love table side prepped guac and this was NOT that). It came prepped and strangely sweet. Weird. My son (a toddler) chose an uncrustable for lunch (I know, how lame), I was thrilled it was an option honestly. However, they microwaved it!! No No No! It specifically states DO NOT microwave on the box - My son got a soupy (and hot-pocket-esque) mess. Was soupy and gross. Things just seems to be more around cost cutting and not as ""fresh"" as you'd want a mexican place to be. My husband really liked his carne asana tacos... But we won't be back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 After the Red Mango fiasco in LA (they closed early on me, after I made the drive from Orange County). I vowed not to go to the LA location. So when I was in Vegas this past weekend, my buddy called me and told me that there was a Red Mango in Vegas. We headed on over at 2am on a Thursday night (morning...really friday morning). There was no one in line...and so I went up and ordered the regular flavor, after I gazed over the decor of the establishment. I sat down and tasted the yogurt. Hmmm it wasn't icy (i like it icy), and it was very creamy. One thing is for sure...it is way different then any of the other yogurt places. (most of the wannabee froyo places all taste about the same). But did I like it? I don't think so. It was a bit too creamy, not cold enough, and had a weird after taste for my liking. When I'm in Vegas, I will probably try it again...or if they open another location in the OC/LA area. ",0,0,0,1,0

Great beers on tap including my PBR, which of course I had to order, especially at $1.50 for a pint! Ordered the 8"" pie, and considering my recent experience at Luisa's Pizza, this was a pleasant surprise. Ordered the 8"" sausage and mushroom and it was good. Crust was crispy enough and it had good flavor. We went for a late lunch so it was not busy at all; however, I can see how it can get busy with the size of the place.

 Ugh. Being a student at UNCC, I rarely venture to the South Park area. For my 21st birthday all I wanted to do was eat at the infamous Cheesecake Factory. We went around 3ish so the wait was only about 5minutes. Being my 21st I kind of expected for the server to at least notice when I got carded and ordered drinks that it was my birthday and he didn't. The drinks were good though. My boyfriend told the server as he passed by that I was a little hurt and the climatic moment I had been waiting for was ruined and he admitted that he only checked the year. Overall the food was meh. I got the steak Diane and shrimp scampi with mashed potatoes. They must pre plate the potatoes when you get the combinations because it turned into a molded shape in the middle. The shrimp and steak were bleh and I can't even complain that I only received 3 shrimps and 3 steak medallions because they weren't very good. Boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken and it was fatty. He said it was alright but the menu says it comes with a plantain. They had a grilled banana on it- maybe they expect people to not know the difference? Cheesecake was very good though. I will never be visiting again. The server did the bare minimum. We left spending $115 including tip but the boyfriend was charged $121. Even though it's $6, that's sketchy. Boyfriend called the manager and the manager said to call his bank because he saw that we were charged $115 but he had to keep explaining that he was over charged. I work at a restaurant and the boyfriend has a chef for a brother so we both are familiar with the service industry and I will never eat at a place with servers bold enough to readjust tips that have a manager that could care less.

 This was my first and last time at Orange Table. I showed up a minute or two after my friends only for the server to pay little to no attention to me, I was never given a menu to look at, never got to order a drink and when I did got the wrong thing, ordered the stake & eggs that should have come with chimichurri as it said on the menu in the name of the dish but got none. The server never asked how I wanted my steak cooked and I was given a raw slab of meat I wouldn't feed my dog. To try and get some attention from my server who spent most of her time in the kitchen I cut my steak in half and left one half on top of the other to show the very uncooked state of my meat, and with no question if we needed anything else or asking how the meal was our checks where on the table and she was gone again.

 I liked the decor in here, and the staff were fast, but the prices and crowds do let it down a bit. Admittedly a crowd is usually a sign of something desirable, so I won't use this against the place. It was just kind of annoying as my friends and I couldn't hear ourselves speak, and we didn't think we were going to a club. We also waited for ages to be served, and it wasn't even the weekend! The expertise in cocktail making really are this place shines. That and the high ceilings and elegant design. Dragonfly does lose a point for the prices... However good the cocktails are, I can't justify paying \ u00a37 for a martini.... Nor \ u00a34 for the cheapest pint on menu. At the end of the day, this is still just a place where people get hammered, and I didn't see much in the way of moderate drinking for the pleasure of it here. I would return if I saw fewer crowds and lower prices... ",0,0,1,0,0

 We checked out Industry yesterday for the first time for lunch. For a Sat lunch they were packed, possibly due to the Pens game that was on. We did not order any drinks, so while they do seem to have an impressively large drink menu (especially beers and whiskeys) I can not comment on that, but only the food. The special of the day was one pound of wings for half price, so my husband, got a pound of wings with the dry rub. My husband normally prefers buffalo wings (which they do have) but did say they have a good dry rub. I got the Lucy sandwich, a roasted veggie sandwich with cheese and a vinaigrette on it. The sandwich was good, but messy as the vinaigrette sauce was runny and just seemed to get everywhere. Instead of the fries that come with the sandwich, I got a side of mac and cheese instead. The mac and cheese was great. Very cheesy. Almost wished I had gotten an entree size serving of mac and cheese. We also got the loaded fries to split. The loaded fries come with bacon and cheddar cheese on them. I would have liked more cheese on them, but the fries were good. The service was lacking. Granted, I know they were busy, but my husband had to wait 5-10 minutes for his soda, and we had to even remind our server about it. When we finally paid the check we again had to wait 5-10 min for the waiter to even come back around to pick it up so we could leave. Overall I think the place has a nice concept, just needs better service. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I was underwhelmed by the food. Ordered the bruschetta for the table. I thought that they were creative with this, but didn't execute it well: there were two types: one with tomatoes and a second with eggplant. The eggplant was a bit bland. It might have been more flavorful had they roasted the eggplant, perhaps? For my entree, I ordered the ricotta spinach gnocchi. The gnocchi tasted just like regular gnocchi - couldn't detect the spinach. The tomato sauce was average...the eggplant crutons were clever, but ultimately didn't quite have the wow factor. I felt like that sauce could have come out of a bottle...And there was a bit too much of the blah sauce. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I finally got an email response from Mike Grimes the General Manager for Classic Car Wash. His attitude in his response reflected the general attitude of everyone involved with my hapless patronage of this ""wannabee"" carwash facility. For clarity purposes I'm posting my initial email to them sent on Friday a.m. I didn't receive any response from anyone until 10:30 p.m. Saturday night: My email to Classic on Friday 4/15 at 10:07 a.m. To Whom It May Concern, I got my car washed today at the 1555 W. Warner Rd. location. I have used them many times before and have never had any issue. Today was a different story. When I brought my car in the service advisor, Dale Collins greeted me pleasantly and kept pushing me to upgrade from my Supreme Wash to a special they were doing. Being in sales I don't begrudge anyone trying to up-sell their services. However he paid no attention to my needs and seemed to be only concerned with his i.e. getting a bigger ticket. I asked him to address a spill in the middle console drink area of my car and he said he would take care of it. According to Alex, the manager, that wasn't even put on the ticket. When my car was ready I walked around it briefly and to my shock and surprise, I saw places that were easily cleaned that had spots of trash still remaining. I drive a 2009 Prius and I keep it pretty clean. Long story short I had to grab a rag myself and clean off some of the more noticeable areas of my car. I paid $24.99 to have you guys clean my car. This was literally the worst car wash I have ever experienced. If I wanted to clean it myself I would have. I have attached some photos of the areas that your people missed on my car. I called in to the store after leaving and spoke to Alex. He lamented the fact that I didn't get a manager while I was there. I told him I had to go to work and was rushed. He did indicate a willingness to address the problems if I were to bring the car back to them. I don't know what quality controls you have in place for your store but whatever they are, they are simply not working. My time is extremely valuable. I paid good money to get my car clean THE FIRST TIME. I don't have time or energy to try to ""get it right"" working with lackadaisical service. I thought you'd like to know of my extreme displeasure working with your store there on W. Warner Rd. This is the first time I've had a problem with your store and will more than likely be the last time. My Car# was 108 and I got that done this a.m. 4/15/11. Sale # 52385024003 You can call me at the number in my signature line if you'd like to discuss my issue. Respectfully, Doug Shields ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The following was Mike Grime's response to my email sent Saturday at 10:53 p.m.: Hi Doug, my name is Mike Grimes and I am the general manager for Classic Car Spa. I read your email and my typical response would be as follows. I apologize for not meeting your expectations with your wash today. We strive to meet and exceed our customer expectations on a daily basis. Our customers satisfaction is obviously our top priority. I spoke to Alex at the site. He assured me that he apologized to you and offered to rewash the vehicle for you at any time you desire and remove the road tar from your vehicle that is not included in any wash we offer. However, since you took your obviously valuable time to insult my employees on yelp.com by calling them monkeys, I will simply say that you are not welcome at any of my locations at any time. I have flagged your license plate number in our system for any associate of mine to contact me if you show up on any of our properties. Find another hard working car wash crew to insult. If you desire to speak to me by phone please contact the corporate office and I assure you I will return your call immediately. Sincerely, Mike Grimes ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Obviously these folks have some serious issues and besides shoddy and mediocre work, a bad attitude is the main one. As any leadership or business class will teach the quality of the service of a company comes from the top down. In this case I can see why the customer wasn't served judging from the manager's response. As an aside I will say that road tar wasn't an issue on my car as he tried to indicate. It was simply dirt that they neglected to wash off of my car. I will also say that I was NOT told that I could bring my car back anytime. Alex tried to get me to bring my car immediately back in and when I couldn't he asked me what time I got off work. He never told me that I could bring my car back in ""ANYTIME"" and get a free wash. If he HAD told me that then none of this would have been posted to begin with and Classic might have kept me as a customer. I don't need to say anymore here folks. You were warned. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I used to live 10 minutes away from this place and my family and I made it a weekly lunch stop on our way to head to Henderson via the 95 to visit family. I always ordered the spicy chicken/teri beef combo. The spice may be too powerful for some so if you're not a big fan of spicy, make sure to steer clear. The teri beef was a bit on the sweet side, but nothing that was terrible. My wife usually ordered the shrimp udon bowl which was also pretty good. My kids enjoyed the Hawaiian Sushi, which is basically your typical ahi sushi roll topped with spicy tuna. It was their taste of home away from home. I haven't been back since I moved back to Hawaii two years ago but a good friend of mine called me a few weeks ago asking about the ""sushi place on Craig"" that I always raved about. I got the report back from him and he gave it two thumbs up as well. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've been a fan of Havana Cafe since discovering the Phoenix location about two years ago. The mojitos are to die for! The best I've had outside of Miami, hands down. On this visit, my first to the Scottsdale location, I decided to go out on a limb and try a new item. I'd always ordered the same dish every visit - Berejenas con Garbanzo (yummy)!!! Anyway, I went for the Caribbean Jerk chicken this time. I was sorely disappointed. In my mind, I'd conjured up a spicy, tangy dish. Instead, I got chicken that appeared to be simmered in a flavorless broth, not at all what I was expecting. The side of potatoes that was served with the entree was good; however, it was an odd pairing. The potatoes were too creamy (i.e. heavy) to be served with the chicken and few pieces of shrimp that were also simmered in the watery broth. My takeaway from this visit: stick with what I know! I'm back to the Berejenas con Garbanzo; the Phoenix location; and, oh yeah, plenty of mojitos! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've heard a lot of people talking about Bond No. 9 recently so I thought I'd check it out for myself. I hate to say but I was disappointed. I went on a Tuesday night and it was fairly busy with 5 tables eating food but that's the maximum they have in their restaurant section. The food was OK - I had Thai fish stew for starter which was a meal within itself and the chunks of fish were swimming over the sides of the bowl so I'd definitely recommend this! That's about the only recommendation I have for this place I'm afraid. I'd heard great things about the chicken and chorizo kebab but it was just chicken and choizo, nothing more special than that. The steaks were delicious - huge, tender with very little fat. I didn't think much of the chips though, not sure how you get chips wrong but the person that I was dining with enjoyed them so perhaps that's down to individual tastes. I had chocolate mouse for desert which was a spoonful of moose so for \ u00a34.50 I thought was a bit stingey. Even though the bar was full of 20-30 something young professionals I just didn't think that there was any atmosphere at all. I wasn't able to fully relax, partly because when I was shown to my seat the waiter explained that I shouldn't lean back on my chair as the back was broken and I'd fall backwards onto the floor?!?!?! Next to me was another chair just sitting in the middle of the restaurant which was blatantly falling apart too so I reckon they need to invest in more furniture! The whole place could do with a spruce up to be honest as the paint was cracking off the walls and in the toilets there were no toilet paper dispenser, just paper scattered all over the floor. I wish I had something better to say but I'm afraid that's it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 As far as Mexican restaurants go, this is one of my favorites. We never come to Scottsdale without going to Jalapeno. I have been coming here for longer than I can remember, and now my lady is as addicted as I. I consider myself a margarita aficionado, and they have among the best margaritas that I have experienced. The beauty of their margarita menu is that there is something for everyone. If you want an awesome margarita in the style that most gringos enjoy, order their ultimate margarita. They make their own sweet and sour, and it is delicious and large. If you don't care for a sweet margarita, order The Boss. It is a more traditional margarita made with only a splash of sweet and sour, but mostly just tequila and lime juice. Enjoy their home fried tortilla chips while you drink your first margarita. They use both flour and corn tortillas to make these. I usually eat all of the flour chips first, but never leave a corn chip behind either. To go with your next margarita just pick about anything off of the menu and you will not be sorry. I most recently ordered the Texas flat enchiladas. The taste was good, but I found the thick masa tortillas held a little too much of the oil in which they were fried and were a bit too rich for my taste. My sister's mushroom and goat cheese enchiladas were yummy and different. My lady's fish tacos were delicious. If you don't want to experiment with something new, order anything more conventional, and you won't be sorry. Other than to visit family and friends, Jalapenos is the reason that I can't wait to return to Scottsdale. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I loved this buffet. I want to marry this buffet. The portions were in small containers which meant you didn't overeat which I really appreciated. The selection and variety were top notch. They had everything from breakfast staples to Chinese food. We did the unlimited mimosas for $40 and it was worth it if you liked to get a little bubbly with your brunch. I was praying when I was there. Praying for another stomach because the food was so good and I wanted to eat as much as of it as I can. Alas, to no avail. I made it to 3 rounds, sans dessert, and I had to throw my towel in. Still, we spent a good 3 to 4 hours there because it was very relaxed and the food watching was spectacular. Will go here again!

 I am a bad, bad person. I discovered FEZ very shortly after moving here 3 years ago, and have never reviewed it. But I promise you, I have made up for this by recommending it to everyone I know. Whenever anyone asks where's good to go, FEZ is my answer. Everything here is spot on. My personal favorite is the Casablanca chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries, but I adore the kibis, the rosemary fries, the burger, the salads, the soup, some lettuce wrap something that Thomas served us, the kisris, and the martinis, oh lord save me from the martinis. Sadly, I have not stopped by for brunch, nor have I ever had any dessert. But seeing as how there has not been one single thing that I've tried there that I didn't absolutely love, I'm sure they're wonderful, and I'll correct this injustice next time I go. The ambience and decor are wonderful, service is good, prices are good. FEZ has been my go-to spot since the first time I went, and I doubt that will ever change. It's great for a nice date, it's perfect for a gaggle of girlfriends, and as I recently found out with Dave, it's even lovely for a lazy late lunch on a Sunday when you can't bring yourself to get dressed up.

I love the shrimp with grits what a great gift. I also love the ceviche, the crab legs, and of course the sushi. Okay let's get to the deserts omg like 100 choices including the sorbets and ice cream, every item was better than the last even sugar free items, the melted molten chocolate pan was superb I am taking my best buddy Ron Jeremy there for his b day in March Wicked Spoon will lose money that day .

 Only giving some stars because they actually changed my oil without problems. But the experience was not good! I asked for my brakes to be checked. When they were done with my oil, they started to send me out on my way until I asked about my brakes. I overheard the attendant ask the tech about my brakes and he replied ""Oh sh*t I forgot! Tell her she needs her front brakes replaced"". I walked out ! ! ! Take note that I had just had the front brake pads replaced just 3 months prior, but it was my rear brakes that were almost shot. I had SunCare Auto fix them for me at a great deal. If I had minded Purrfect, I would have had new brakes replaced again and the rear brakes would have never been taken care of and God knows what could have happened then. I can understand an honest mistake, but to blatantly LIE about something as they did, and possibly cause me more problems down the road..... they don't deserve to be in business ",1,0,0,0,0

 My family and I are huge seafood lovers, but Rayan was the worst experience ever. I do not recommend this place to anyone, because the service was terrible and the food was disgusting. All of the three dishes we ordered were absolutely unedible. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Coyote Ugly was the end of our 9 bar journey before we headed back to the hotel to crash. In the movie, ""Coyote Ugly"" was explained as a one night stand where you would rather gnaw off your arm than look at the person you were with. I think that sums up the experience of the experience. Once we got in, it was apparent that besides the name, it was nothing like the movie. There was a girl on the bar the entire night, but she was not so into it. We got a ""Yeah, Vegas"", ""How do you feel?"", ""Can you scream?"", ""Whoop, Whoop"" but it was all in a monotone voice. There was no dancing on the bar tops. Barely any interaction with the crowd. We ended up bouncing after 20 minutes and called it a night. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Wow...the food was GREAT. The atmosphere was decent. Our server....well she talked to much and told us about what bad customers were at the table right next to us. While they were sitting there. The prices...a bit high..but the quality was excellent so I was ok with it. My take...it is worth the visit. Would I rush back...no. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The only good thing about our experience with this restaurant was the view of the fish tank out by the pool. First the waitress forgot our drinks. Then when she did bring our drinks, or should I say drink, she forgot my wife's wine. Fine, we told here to just make sure that it was not on the bill. We ordered a pasta plate, and a chicken margarita pizza. Pasta, well, to be honest, was so, so, but not bad. The pizza, oh, the pizza........ it was absolutely the worst thing I have eaten in a long time. For me to spit out my food in a restaurant, wow, something has to be horribly wrong. Well it was. The chicken tasted like it was 2 weeks old. No joke, no exaggeration, old chicken has to be one of the worst things you can put in your mouth. Now imagine a piece of pizza you had just bitten into being covered in it!!!! We informed the waitress, who must be an out of work actress, because she said that she could not believe what we were telling her and that she would look into it with the chef. So we waited for some kind of response as to what may have gone wrong, after about 15 min of waiting, the manager comes over and tells us that he cannot belive that the chicken was like that and that the chef was looking into it. Then he just walked away. No joke, no apologies, no comping the meal, nothing, he just repeated the same thing to us that the waitress had told us 15 min earlier and walked away!!! My wife and I were going to walk out, but, unfortunately for us we have ethics. Finally we were able to get the attention of our waitress and got our bill, paid for the food we had eaten and left. Please don't ever eat here, I don't want you to have to find out what old chicken, and I mean really old chicken taste like, the way that we had too. Also, to be treated so cold by the manager, and a forgetful waitress is absolutely unacceptable. In today's economy businesses need to appreciate any and all customers who walk into their establishment. Never, ever again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I'd actually give Mix 2.5 if I could...nothing tasted horrible, just underwhelming. The interior looked really cool, a bit dim for my liking. Service was decent. The food however, was lacking, especially with the steep price. Seared foie gras - good quantity, but wasn't seared enough, or flavored enough. Served with beets, which was interesting. Mac n Cheese - good, but pretty normal. Bison - pretty good, again, a bit lacking in flavor Monkfish - slightly tough, not much flavor. Wasn't this featured in Top Chef? And bread - they were cold. For the price of everything, couldn't they serve warm bread? So yes, I would not come back here again, when there are tons of other restaurants in Vegas. ",0,1,0,0,0

 On my third trip to Vegas, my main priority was not to get sht-face wasted and it was not to shop until I dropped, but rather it was to eat in a treehouse. And that I did! I was sooo excited to try Mastro's (Mah-stro's or May-stro's?) after hearing ridiculously good things about this place. I made reservations online, and called ahead to request a seat in the treehouse. Service is impeccable here! Everyone was super nice and friendly. We started with the lemon drop dry ice martini and it was possibly the coolest (pun intended) alcoholic drink I've ever had! The dry ice fizzles over the top and there is a mini tornado in your martini glass!! It tasted great as well! Perfect blend of sweet and tart - with, of course, a kick of alcohol! To eat, I ordered the filet mignon and we split truffle gnocchi, lobster mashed potatoes and sugar snap peas as sides. My steak was perfectly cooked, silky and tender. The gnocchi and mashed potatoes took it over the top to glutton overload. Those dishes are soooo richhhh and decadent and creammmyyy. Yum. I definitely think I gained 10 pounds that night. Bad for your waistline, bad for your wallet, but great for your taste buds! ",0,0,0,0,1

 An absolute triumph. I had the unique caprese bruschetta. The bruschetta was interestingly compiled with cubed mozz- a definite twist on the classical slab. For an entree, I had the pasta trio. Normally, gnocchi is dense and heavy, but this particular one in the trio was light and pillowy. The waitress was extremely friendly and accommodating. They even moved us to a table with an outlet!

 Super popular hip restaurant in the Capitol area of Madison. Not crazy about the hour long waits, but I did enjoy the farm to table offerings. Their seasonal lemonade was fantastic - mine was cherry raspberry. For appetizers we had the mac and cheese made with 10 year old cheddar. I realize the cheese was aged but I think it would have benefited from a blend of cheeses to make the flavor more complex. The artisan bread was tasty, but the style was more homemade than artisan. They were rolls like the kind you could make in your oven at home. Truffle popcorn is a huge trend right now, and I was glad to try their rendition. It was natural popcorn, a little salty and a hint of truffle. I think I would've preferred more of a dunking of truffle. Finally, the cheese curds. AMAZING! The breading was light and the dipping sauce complemented nicely. For our entrees we had the warm farro salad and the fried chicken and waffle. The warm farro salad was great - a lot of fresh vegetable ingredients and a nice tangy vinegarette dressing. The fried chicken was a bit disappointing. The batter was laid on very thick and so the chicken was encrusted with this coat of batter that didn't have the unevenness or crispy texture you'd get with a light hand battered chicken. Overall, a good restaurant - high end and hip with good farm to table choices. Next time, i'll stick with more vegetables. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This should be kept a secret so that no one has the terrible food I had. There are many great Thai places in Las Vegas and there is no need to eat here. The only plus is that the tiny dining room is cute. Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in. Firecracker prawns were deep fried breaded shrimp with some sauce drizzled on, really would a ramekin of sauce kill you? Normally I am used to prawns in yummy egg roll wrappers. My husband sent back the drunken noddles because it had eggs, which we have never had in any Thai restaurant ever. He then got a very unremarkable basil chicken which was had so much gristle he had to spit it out. My crab fried rice either had fake crab or really terrible crab. The only okay thing was the chicken satay we ordered for the children. The water was infused with fruit, that wasn't bad. The presentation was all stick on a slice of pineapple. Either figure out some new plating or serve it family style. ",1,0,0,0,0

 as a kid, i remember going to sbarro in the malls back in illinois. even as a teenager, we would still hit up sbarro. i remember the pizza being huge slices of super thin, delicious, greasy pizza. i dont know what happened. the gf and i were at fashion square and i thought i could relive my youth. i could not have been more wrong. talk about garbage pizza. i had a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni. the pizza tasted and looked like it was just a reheated, frozen pizza. the crust sucked, the slice was small with a thicker crust, the sauce tasted like sweet artificiality. and not ""sweet"" as in ""good,"" ""sweet"" as in too much sugar."" and the cheese congealed in about 30 secs to a weird, fake cheese consistency. they also had other italian entrees sitting in the trays, but these looked like they had been sitting in the same spot since the mall opened that morning. the gf made fun of me when i said i was going to yelp the sbarros at the mall . . . but i want to save anyone else from having their teenage mall memories drowned in gross tomato sauce and crappy crust.

 There are too many good places to eat within the same price range for me to give this place a second shot. The staff was friendly and smiley, all the things you expect your hostess and waiter to be when you walk into a restaurant. The decor is nice. There is a beautiful red sculpture in the middle of the dinning room that I really liked. The booths are comfortable with good spacing. You're not sitting on top of the people next to you. They also have a patio that looked nice and an outdoor fireplace. I would sit outside on my next visit except I won't be going back. The food was less than awesome. The soup of the day was a really good cream of mushroom. Good consistency, great flavor. The salad was iceberg lettuce with a few cucumber slices and tomato wedges. Pretty standard house salad, decent vinaigrette. From there we split a lobster hoagie with arugula and paprika remoulade and the pan seared Pacific salmon with wild mushroom risotto. I substituted asparagus for the french fries that come standard with all the burgers/sandwiches. When the plate arrived in front of me, there were only 3 short, fat stalks on my plate which is a shame because I really love veggies.The risotto was the only other item worth mentioning or maybe it's just that I really like mushrooms. Anyway, the risotto was good, but not good enough to make up for everything that the other food lacked. The restrooms here are ridiculously small. The door to the stall opens inward so you literally have to step back between the toilet and the wall to pull the door back toward you. Seriously? I was wearing a skirt and the last thing I wanted was to accidentally touch my bare skin to the toilet bowl. The whole outing was not a terrible experience but there is no need for a repeat performance. ",0,1,0,0,0

 really just a waste of money and calories. Unimpressive fare that left me really thirsty after. Very full during the lunch rush hour, I am assuming because of it's location since the food leaves a lot to be desired. Worst part was after paying the woman at the cash kept insisting that we leave her a tip, when we didn't understand what she was saying at first because it was so busy, she began angrily demanding a tip. I am usually a good tipper, no need to yell at me for one. Found this quite gauche. ",0,1,0,0,0

 After searching long and hard for a nice nail salon to go to we came across Teres. After reading reviews and looking at the website we thought it would be a nice relaxing place to go....unfortunately this was not the case. We went for gel manicures and a regular pedicure. The manicurist I was with seemed rushed, rude and incompetent at her job. During the manicure she clipped my finger when cutting my cuticles and caused me to bleed, the polish job was sloppy and excess was left on my fingers and not removed. Due to her difficulty painting my nails she switched with another manicurist to finish the remainder of my manicure. My pedicure was ok but still not worth the money. If the job of was done well this would be a great nail salon, however 3 of us left unsatisfied and it is safe to say we will not be returning. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The spa facilities need an overhaul, but the treatments and people were great. Went in December stayed at the Planet Hollywood and my husband scheduled me a spa time as a Christmas gift. The lady in locker room helping me wasn't too enthusiastic about being there, and I was a little to hungover to care. The treatments were great, had an anti-aging facial and some sort of wrap...where you are seriously wrapped up and marinated for about 30 minutes...then shower all the algae off and then get a massage...which was great! But afterward I wanted to brush or comb my hair and looked up and down for something, I'm used to a spa having disposable combs, razors, toothbrushes and soap accessible...but none was to be found. Some of it was locked up and you had to ask for it, or.... I finally asked the not so nice lady about where I could find a comb...annoyed by my apparently dumb question she pointed to the box on the counter that I guess sanitizes 3 brushes for reuse....The brushes had hair on them still and well it was a hard decision to figure out whether or not I wanted my hair knotted in a ball or brushed to look somewhat decent... The seating was uncomfortable, but if your tired enough I guess you can nap as one woman did...lol and the water dispenser was broken so they provided bottled water for you. It just seemed like a lot of stuff was out of place or out-of date... I don't know if they are working on an upgrade and letting this one slide till then, but had I know about this beforehand I would of opted to wait. ",0,0,1,0,0

 If I could give zero stars I would. Hospitality is not their speciality. I was traveling from California with my son and two friends for a skateboarding event. When checking in as soon as she saw us there was a change in attitude. I am a normal 45 ur old mom, who kids love skateboarding. No tattoos or piercings. Lol We were constantly harassed regarding smoking after telling them WE DON'T SMOKE! I felt the person checking is in, I think the manager Bobby, gave us the worst room. I felt like we were being punished. After requesting something else which they refused, I later upgraded to a deluxe room just to change rooms. While changing rooms we were threatened again that we would be kicked out if we smoke! Instead of feeling harassed during our stay we decided to cancel our stay early and go the Holiday Inn next door. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I give it one star for being able to cut in line because I was a cute girl alone. Which was so freakin ridiculous to just let certain people in and not others. Lines are for posers, let's me honest. The only way I would stand in a line is if the booze was free. I give it negative 1,000 stars because I got pushed about 10 times. I couldn't even get a drink because the bartenders apparently couldn't multi task. No one came up to talk to me. ( I'll leave that to the overall bad flavor I get from OTS). So I stayed until the girls potty line wasn't 10 miles long and ran for my life. ",1,0,0,0,0

 THIS is a Crowne Plaza? I must disagree. So I'm not on the club floor, but since when is a fourth-floor King Suite more comparable to Section 8 housing than a reputable hotel chain? I feel like I have gone back in time, to my baby-boomer parent's 1980's bungalow (not on the beach people - think small, dark, smelly and well, 80s). Towels? Yuck. Wallpaper? Significantly peeling off the walls. Windowsill? Covered in bugs ON THE INSIDE. Curtains? Burned with cigarettes. Furniture? Sagging and questionable. I could go on, but I'm sure you get the point. We checked in around midnight after driving to Madison from Chicago in a horrible snowstorm. I was in NO mood for the clueless night auditor who argued with us about everything and then could not seem to locate one luggage cart or extra pillow. Give me a break. I think everything here looks dirty, low-brow and in need of an upgrade. Considering I have to stay two more nights I'm going to go ahead and suck it up, but for those of you who aren't here yet, I would go ahead and make a beeline for the other direction. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Went there last night with my family. I have been here several times and the food and service have been ok. Not last night! I ordered the fish and chips and it was undercooked. Had to send it back, not really into sushi. I then ordered the pulled pork bbq. What a disaster. It was a big ball of mush plopped down on a kaiser roll.Had to drown it with their sauce to achieve any flavor. Yuk! The final straw was the sweet tea. It tasted old and not very sweet. Had to add sweet and low. Also, the glass of tea had very little ice. Now folks, if you can't get bbq and sweet tea right, you might be better off taking them off your menu. The service was friendly and the manager on duty offered to make it right, but with me, two strikes and I'm out--of there. Also, if you go on a cold evening, you may want to sit near the back of the restaurant. Every time a customer walks in , a huge rush of cold air comes in--not very comfortable. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Bicycle-friendly and vegan, Green is one of my favorite places. I ordered a Mickey sandwich with a side of faux Buffalo wings. While that was being prepped, I ducked out to Nami next door and got a peanut butter and chocolate blizzard, non-diary treat. It was obvious that I should eat the Nami first, because its the best. That Nami was so delicious it made the whole meal a real treat. Thanks to the cooks at Green and the folks at Nami I had a vegan feast fit for a peasant.

 This is one of my favorite bars anywhere ever in the universe, so why the three star rating? It's expensive. On my last trip here, my party paid $100 for the privilege of sitting down on the table'd side, as opposed to standing on the non-table'd side. Sitting is the way to go if you're in a large party and want to sit together, standing is the way to go when you're on a date and need an excuse to get really close to your friend. I digress. We bought a few drinks at the table, and my tab was $40. There were four of us! Two of us ordered beer! What did the girls order? Adamantium?! Jeez! I just feel that spending that amount of money was too much for a drink and seating. Maybe that's just me. Other than that, this place is pretty awesome when it's packed. The more packed the place gets, the more fun it gets. You need people here who want to sing along to Billy Joel, The Eagles, Air Supply... or you need people who have had too many beers and don't care about sounding like braying mules. Either way, you need people here. When this place starts to thin out, the synergy drops too quickly. Also, it gets lame when the guys keep asking you for money. I mean, come on. I get it, I have to pony up if I want to hear Eye of the Tiger, but to interrupt me like 1 minute into my jam because someone gave you $60 for Garth Brooks?! Come on! On my last excursion out here, the place got dead around midnight, which is entirely too early in Las Vegas. It should be swamped then, no? By 12:30, it was clear they were trying to get everybody into it, but it wasn't working. The mojo was gone. On previous trips there, the magic has been there all night. One night, a few years ago, the music was perfect, the crowd was hot, everyone had liquid courage, and the ladies (who were also strippers) were really putting on a show to music of Bon Jovi.

 First and foremost......the BEST...... and I mean the BEST banana nut muffin I have ever had. Actually it was the BEST muffin I ever had. When I took my first bite of it, I looked at my friend across the table and muttered, ""oh fuck"". I don't say those lovely words outside of the bedroom often but it was all I could say. It was a heavenly experience. There was 3 of us so we shared the blueberry stuffed french toast that was on special and the green chili omelet the waitress recommended. The omelet was a tad too salty. If you know me, then you know things can hardly be too salty for my taste but it just wasn't that good. The stuffed french toast however was great. The blueberries were plump and the syrup wasn't too sweet. Love the chewy consistency of the bread. Not gross like some over the top stuffed french toast but a well balance of sweetness, moistness and loveliness ( Yes, I'm still talking about food)The waitress was great since we were virgins to this place and was so very helpful. The coffee was really good too. The counter for paying was irritating though. The cashier is by the door so you get traffic coming in and going out. Only 1 cashier and that can get really irritating especially when the place is busy. Overall....this is a great joint for breakfast and we will definitely be back on our trips out to Henderson/Vegas. It is worth the trip. :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 Prices here are higher compared to other Chinese places, even moreso for the quality you get being its just a simple Chinese restaurant.

I did love that they took all the bones off the duck though so I was able to eat to my hearts content. The egg drop soup was... Ehhh. I could've made it better at home.

 cheaper than a pair of chop sticks. food wise: I have been to lots of Chinese restaurants in NJ, MA, GA and NY, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. and this one provides food that we call it ""'Chinese food' for Americans"". Even on that standard, i give it a 1 out of 5. service wise: the 5 of us were from out of town for a conference after which we thought we could have some snack food w/ beer back in hotel. therefore, we paid this place a visit. One of my friends is vegetarian so we ordered egg roll for him. we ordered 3 from appetizer menu and one dish. that takes them 30 minutes to make. Then before i left with my takeout, i checked the bag and there were only 2 pairs of chopsticks! I told the woman (mid-age) there we have 5 ppl. and she gave me 2 more pairs. I asked her for one more pair and she said to me ""you don't need chopsticks to eat egg roll,"" in referring to my vegetarian friend. Out of disgust, i asked her ""does one extra pair gonna cost you anything?"" and she replied w/ her high pitch voice, ""everything costs money!""

 If you have long hair and want to keep it, do yourself a favor and pay the extra money for a good quality hair cut. I had my hair butchered here yesterday by a Fantastic Sam's stylist and I walked out looking like a lopsided freak. If only I had taken a picture before having it fixed elsewhere today because you really had to see it to believe it. I explained very clearly what I wanted to the stylist, which was barely more than a simple trim. If the stylist wasn't comfortable with cutting long hair she should have called over someone else at that time or had me wait. She clearly is not ready to be cutting hair and she should never be allowed to touch thinning shears, especially on someone with already thin hair. My hair is so thin on one side that I part my hair on the side so that I can even out my hair. Now I have half as much hair in the front because for some reason she felt she needed to chop half the hair off several times with thinning shears all the way down to the ends. You can see the chop lines through my thin hair. I also discussed not liking bangs, so fortunately she only gave me bangs on the left side of my head. The right side has no bangs and what hair is left on that side is choppy because of the thinning shears. It will be years before my hair recovers from this disaster because it's down to my waist. Unfortunately the damage was more than the stylist I went to today could fix, but he did even it out as much as possible. I will spend the next several years growing out the unattractive and unnecessary chop marks from the thinning shears. My hair only grows 1/6 of an inch per month even with biotin. A woman's hair is her identity and I feel like I have been seriously violated. I would rather have a root canal any day than a bad hair cut that takes years to recover from both physically and mentally. I hope this review helps someone to avoid the same painful mistake I made. I should have asked questions like: How long have you been out of beauty school? How much experience do you have with long hair? Do you feel comfortable trimming long hair knowing the client's hair grows slower than most and the client will be crying herself to sleep and again each time she passes a mirror? It has only been one day since I was violated, only 1094 more days to go before I can hopefully put this nightmare behind me. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Joe's Farm Grill features everything that is All-American. Burgers, pizzas, salads, hot dogs, and a variety of other classics, each with their own twist. I was pleasantly surprised that Sonoran Dogs were on the menu (I rarely see them outside of Tucson). I got a burger that was gigantic and yummy--don't forget to ask for grilled onions. There are a number of novelties in each of Joe's restaurants, but my favorite part about this one is that it is nestled right next to farmland. The ingredients here touted to be fresh and local, and I could definitely taste the difference in my burger and especially in the fruit cup. I took my brother here for his birthday; he got a 4B and looved it. He wasn't able to complete the trifecta but there will always be next year! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Customer service, hair cut, and attitude, all sucked! Went in with my son for 2 haircuts. Had to wait 1hr for a 15min wait. I could understand if other people were in front of me. I was the only one waiting. After 30min of waiting, one stylist finished her hair cut... chatted for awhile with the other stylist... then left to get lunch and make a deposit at the bank. She said sorry but she had to get there before they closed. I stuck it out. After an hr the stylist that was still there (working on color or perm or something) bitched and complained about being stuck there with no competent help. She acted like she was doing me a favor by cutting my hair. I didn't get my son's haircut there after all that. When I got home my wife told me to go back and have them fix it. No way! My wife tried to help but made it worse. I went to the great clips on buffalo Vegas and they fixed it for me. If you want to get butchered, don't mind wasting your day, and love hearing people bitch about their job.... give this place a shot. Don't bring a gun because you'll probably kill yourself.

 Went back to San Tan again and even though the rating didn't go up, I did enjoy both my food and my beer much more than the last few times. It looks like there are a few more appetizers on the happy hour menu. This time we tried the pretzel and the cilantro jalape \ u00f1o hummus (which is a hummus flavor that seems to be popping up everywhere these days). The pretzel was served with cheese and coarse ground mustard, I always think the mustard is better. The hummus came with a few cucumber slices, pita bread, tortilla chips, and a few olives and grape tomatoes. Both appetizers were good. I was conflicted when ordering a drink. I knew I wasn't excited about any of their brews, didn't feel like a mixed drink, and didn't want to order wine in a brewery (I'm not even sure if they have wine, I'm guessing they do, but I wasn't going to be ""that"" chick to order wine in a brewery. Long story short (too late?) I noticed the seasonal brew on the board, Coffee Stout. Being a Guinness and Four Peaks Oatmeal Stout fan, I asked our server to try it and ended up with a full glass. It tasted more coffee than beer, but it was good. I'm not sure it could ever top Four Peaks in my book, but now I know that there are a few things on the menu that I enjoy. ",0,0,1,0,0

 There really isn't much else to say about BFG that hasn't been said many, many times prior. The food is as delicious as it is simple. The service is incredible and when I had to move back across the country I felt bad that I would no longer be able to give Jin my money anymore for his delicious chicken strips. The chicken strips are great whether you get them Baked, Fried or Grilled. I was always partial to the Fried due to the breading being so crisp. The Mac and Cheese is wonderfully cheesy and stays hot and gooey for a very, very long time. They offer a wide variety of dipping sauces and you really can't go wrong with them. Pick as your mood/taste dictates. The weekly rotating specials are also all very good choices to get. I am partial to the nachos but the Bi Bam Bap is also fantastic. There's a reason why BFG has consistently ranked in the top few spots for food in Vegas. What it does it does extremely well for the food and Jin goes to great lengths that are no longer common at all to make you feel welcome and valued as a customer. Its really strange to see how customer service has more or less died but it makes it easy for a well-run place like BFG to endear itself to so many Vegas dwellers. I look forward to the next time I am in Vegas so I can get some fried strips, mac and cheese and hopefully, it'll be chicken nachos week. Before we moved I was unable to eat here one last time due to surgery and had to watch my wife enjoy one more Bi Bam Bap from there while I drank an Ensure. A tough thing to endure. Actually, as I submit this review I see its chicken nachos week and it pains me to know I can't get any, well, barring a 2100 mile flight/drive... ",0,0,0,0,1

 I won't deny that Hendersons is an Edinburgh institution. It was the first specially vegetarian restaurant in Edinburgh in the 70s, at a time when people were beginning to become aware of it. Despite the mainstream disapproval of vegetarianism this place was really trendy, and still rides on its fame from the good old days. We are lucky to have the number of vegetarian restaurants in Edinburgh that we do today. This, however, means more competition for Hendersons. Nonetheless it still remains probably the best known. I have mixed feelings about Hendersons however. On one hand it provides a great variety of generally good quality vegetarian food, on the other its pricey for what you pay for and the menu never really seems to change. It's a great shame that some of the other criticisms here have confused some generally bad experiences that could have happened at any restaurant, with the fact this restaurant just happens to be vegetarian. It's clearly fallacious to say that just because your cake wasn't creamy enough vegetarian restaurants must disapprove of creamy cakes. Any restaurant could serve you a disappointing flapjack. It reminds me of the sort of arguments you here from intolerant travellers when they are abroad and don't like something they've been served or whatever and equate it with something necessary about the culture or the people. That aside Hendersons does have it downside. I love their chickpea and tomato stew, but it's not that special, it's something I cook all the time and don't expect to pay \ u00a36 for it. I love their crusty bread with curry, but could they change it around more often? I find Hendersons can be too expensive for simple dishes that seem to always be the same (albeit from a great range). On the former point I sometimes feel that Hendersons now caters mostly for the New Town residents, perhaps the rebellious youth of the 70s now all grown up and able to afford it. They do offer a student discount however. But now let me defend Hendersons and say that the quality of the food, both nutritionally and taste wise, is still high above the average, and unlike most pubs or standard Italian restaurants, I don't feel like I owe my body an apology after eating there. I don't think that a slab of flesh maketh a meal (considering our bodies aren't made to eat meat with every meal and that 6-7% of the worlds population live without meat, through choice or circumstance, this claim seems ridiculous). I think to claim that Hendersons is a place that can be ""okay for some lifestyles but not for me really"" or ""not really my thing cos I eat meat"" is a claim from someone who hasn't tried the range of dishes available here, or has some problematic addiction to one particular food group (besides presumably these people don't literally eat meat with every single meal: breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacking- or they probably don't have much longer to live). Again, you might not like Hendersons because they are rude or the dishes are cold or you thought the curry tasted crap, but the mere absence of meat in a place surely does not make it a pleasure only for the select few. Incidentally Hendersons is not unfriendly, the dishes aren't cold and nearly all the dishes I've tried (quite a number) have tasted very nice. A great vegetarian institution that still remains a great option despite some setbacks. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I don't know why I don't come here more often when I visit from NYC! This place has expanded into the space next door so you don't ever have to worry about a wait! This time we had the crab cake sandwich which was delicious. There was more crab meat than breading which makes it a lot healthier. The ciabatta bread was also fresh - crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Even the cole slaw was awesome. We also had the Benny roll which was amazing. The shrimp tempura was freshly fried and the salmon was lightly seared as I had requested. Totally rivals places in NY! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Just as delicious as Tandoori II, but way fancier! We went on a Friday night and if we had been blindfolded in the way over I would have sworn we were in Scottsdale. The food was awesome, the building beautiful and the patio with firepits and heaters and hookahs are a great addition to the ambiance. If you have not tried Indian food before, this is the place to do so. The tikka masala and naan and fragrant rice are all great beginner dishes. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is the service was pretty damn slow making us miss happy hour specials. I will say though, the belly dancer and music were rad but it made some of our party feel awkward as we didn't know if we were supposed to stop our conversation to watch and tip. All in all, this is a great place. ",0,0,0,1,0

 It was March 2002 that my good friend first took to Sumo's. Since then, I am hard pressed to be interested in any other Sushi establishment. I've tried others, but none are as fresh. I order: 1.

 Update to yesterday's review: All was fine until I started the laptop the next morning and it got so hot I nearly destroyed it -- I had taken it in SPECIFICALLY because it had gotten hot. My lovely techie did a remote diagnosis, so I told the Smartfix guy, Robert, exactly what was wrong with it and asked him to clean the air vents, check the fan and add thermal paste. Apparently he did that but didn't check that it worked -- because it did not. Within a few minutes of work, the laptop was smart enough to shut itself off. It was very hot and I could barely touch it. I was on deadline and rushed back to the store, where Robert, very nonchalantly, decided, chuckling, that he had --FORGOTTEN TO CONNECT THE FAN AFTER CLEANING IT! Sure, mistakes happen, but this is a rookie mistake that any vocational student wouldn't make. I was quite upset, as I run a small business and this laptop is my life, but there was no apology -- nothing! He just said that everything is fixable and to come back later, further complicating my deadline situation. I would have forgiven the mistake, as mistakes are human, but if I'd made a mistake like that, I'd be begging the customer for forgiveness and offering all sorts of discounts. But no, Robert really simply seemed to not understand that it's important to get it right the first time to keep customers coming back. He's nonchalant to the point that it appears that he doesn't care. He did fix it the second time around, but still, I am sorely disappointed by the lack of interest/urgency. I have pretty low expectations, but I do expect things to be fixed the first time. __________________________________________________________________ I am having a really bad IT day -- both my laptop and my Android have issues. I called Smartfix -- read some good Yelp reviews -- and had my questions answered. Just dropped everything off and I am happy with the level of expertise and service thus far. Might upgrade to 5 stars if the stuff actually works after I pick it up. Happy to hear they can turn these around in a few hours, as it's hard to run a business without the IT basics. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I tried out this restaurant last Saturday night for the 1st time and I was very impressed. Our table had the loaded tater tots and blue cheese chips as appetizers and they were both very tasty! They had jambalaya on the menu as a special for the night and it was DELICIOUS! My friends were very pleased with their choices, as well. The atmosphere was great. I don't think there was one direction you could look without seeing a TV, which made it great to watch the football game. As far as service goes, it was excellent! It was our server's first day working at DB's Tavern. Our table had a number of questions about menu items. She knew the answer to most of them, but if she didn't then she quickly found out and reported back to us and she had nothing but a smile on her face the entire night! She was on top of everything throughout our dining experience. Our glasses never got empty before she asked if we needed more. It may sound strange, but that is an important factor to me when I am dining somewhere. I don't like having an empty glass. Nikki took very good care of us. Oh, and did I mention she did this while the restaurant was absolutely full of people?! Top notch service and food! Me and a 'few"" of my friends are going back today!

 Came here for lunch with my pops, who was fiending for their $6.95 soup/salad/breadsticks extravaganza. He is a huge fan of this deal, but unfortunately did NOT receive it, since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, and they only offer their lunch specials on WEEKDAYS. Another slight issue I had was the fact that the waiter messed up my order, but the manager gladly replaced it free-of-charge for me, and gave me her humble apologies. Once I received the dish I ordered - beef medallions over fettuccine alfredo - it was actually pretty tasty. It featured green onions, chives, sauteed spinach, and tasted pretty fresh, discounting the strong vinaigrette coating on the steak.

 My third stay here. FIrst of all, it's a timeshare, not a hotel, a fact which seems to have eluded some of the previous reviewers. We own at another Marriott timeshare, so we knew exactly what to expect. Nice, clean accommodations, separate bedroom, two flat screen TVs, nice big bathroom, full kitchen, washer/dryer combo. We also knew what not to expect - a casino. The ability to ""upgrade."" Shopping on site (there is a small market, and that's it.) Restaurants. The location is quite convenient, with a side entrance to Planet Hollywood basically across the street. The comments about the place being for an ""older crowd"" might not be out of line. When I was 25, I wouldn't want to stay at a place with no casino, and the beauty of the washer/dryer would have been totally lost on me. But I'm 58 now, and I love walking into the lobby after a night out and not being assaulted by lights and slot machine noise. I guess I would say it was good for families with kids, too, except that I don't happen to think families with kids should vacation in Vegas. Sorry, but that's my opinion, deal with it. Anyway, to summarize, if nice accommodations and the ability to wash the smoke stench out of your clothes appeals to you, this is a good place to stay. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We found out about this hotel due to a timeshare spiel I got us lured into. This hotel was one of their ""upgrade options"", so for an extra $99 we were able to stay here for our 3 nights on the timeshare company. I must say, this hotel was one of the best discoveries we could have ever made. This place is a non-smoking and non-gaming hotel near the convention center and the monorail. Not terribly convenient for summer time traveling(too hot to walk far,etc).and the other hotels are a $12-$15 cab ride away. These are the only downfalls to this hotel. The customer service is by far the best I have ever received at a hotel-especially of this caliber. Friendly and helpful to the max. We ordered room service for breakfast every day, it was wonderful. The bed was super comfy with great bedding and plenty of pillows. The water pressure in the shower was better than any I have had while traveling and the bathroom had a separate shower and tub. We had a view of the Wynn's golf course and I would happily stay here again in a heartbeat-even on my own dime! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Update: Went again on Saturday, 8/10. Looks like Light isn't a secret anymore. It was twice as crowded as I remember it being the first time I went. Both times were for A-Trak too so I don't think it was because of the draw of the DJ. I think everyone is realizing it's the best club in Vegas and telling all their friends. With that said, pre-sale people, don't get there any later than 11:00PM. If you're there before 11:00PM, you're likely to walk right in with minimal waiting. If you come after 11:00PM, be prepared to wait for 30 minutes or longer. also, if you get in early, you'll have more space on the dancefloor to do what you do and more space at the bar to get your drinks quickly.

 Updated Review I was invited back to Hakkasan with comped VIP tickets (Pretty much just tickets to cut the line). This experience was a lot better than the previous experience. However, I noticed a lot of similar problems as the first time. The biggest difference was just that the ratio was a bit better and the dance floor wasn't AS packed, but still way too packed. Simply put, come to Hakkasan if it's a DJ you really REALLY MUST see. The experience most likely will be lacking because of the packed dance floor. Or come if you can get in for free. Or come if you're willing to blow some serious cash on a table. Otherwise STAY AWAY. I've had multiple friends get injured on the dance floor because of how crowded it was. This includes being stepped on, being elbowed in the nose, and best of all, having a drunkard think you're messing with them and start beating the shit out of you. Honestly surprised there isn't a lawsuit going on. -------------------- Review 11/27/2013 I'm confused what all the hype is about. This was one of the worst clubbing experiences I've had in Las Vegas. Pluses: It's pretty Cons: All the space is dedicated to tables The ratio was like at LEAST 80 percent guys The DJ was absolutely horrendous Compound all of this on to a small dance floor and you get a cramped cockfest with everyone just standing there. For the price you pay, this was just ridiculous. Hakkasan, please learn to set a better ratio into the club. I'm pretty sure if there was a group of guys, they would rather not get in than get in and be crowded with a bunch of other dudes. Also for the dance floor, security should regulate the amount of people entering the dance floor. This would ensure that people are not squished like sardines and aren't even able to move.

 This place wasn't gross, but it wasn't good. I honestly just got a ton of salad and ice cream. I'd be pissed if I spent the full price on it but my friend checked in on Foursquare so we got a buy-one-get-one voucher so it was like $30 for the two of us for dinner. I guess it was fun to try a buffet in Vegas but maybe my expectations were a little too high? I'd rather have spent twice that and had a real meal at a good restaurant.

 We went tonight as a group of 5 celebrating two birthdays. My husband, myself, our daughter, Mother/Father-in-law. We arrived at 5:30 on a Wednesday evening and were seated quickly. Unfortunately, it was the only thing that was quick. Everything else was slow, slow, slow. It took a long time for the server to come to our table to acknowledge us and take a drink order. My father-in-law gave her a dirty fork from his place setting when we sat down and she said she'd bring another one, which she never did. He also asked her a question and she didn't know the answer and said she would find out which she never did. We ordered two appetizers and everyone ordered an entree. She said that she would wait to order the entrees so we would have time to finish the appetizers. I had a feeling that wasn't a good idea and I was right because 5 people finished two small appetizers rather quickly and it was a long time before the food arrived. Long after we had ordered, she came back to ask my husband if he wanted chicken or veal...she couldn't remember. Drinks sat empty on the table. After we received our food, the server came once quickly to see how everything was. I had a bit of food in my mouth and didn't have time to stop her to ask for another wine and more water....both glasses completely empty. My daughter's glass was empty. The server decided everything was fine and ran off. I didn't have a chance to even ask for more water. I think that she at least should have been able to see that glasses were empty. We sat with empty plates for a long time after finishing dinner. We waited a long time for the check. When she brought the check I knew that if we didn't give her the credit card immediately we'd end up waiting a long time for her to return. Unforunately she dropped the check and left before Father-in-law could get the credit card out so we waited a long time for her to come back. The food was just okay. The place was so loud that we felt like we had to shout to hear each other. I had a headache by the time we were done. :-( Honestly, we won't be back. I can understand being busy, poor service/bad night/off night, so-so food, poor ambiance...but when it is all of those things combined into the first experience at a place it just makes me not want to come back. There are too many other great places out there. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Went there with a group of about 8 people. I ordered a 'big' margarita...which actually wasn't bad. The food on the menu looked good, but I was not a fan of the chips and salsa. I know most people rave about it...but the whole squeeze bottle salsa was actually too thin for me. I like my salsa chunky so that I can dig in with my chips. Anyways, I ordered the my food and was happy with it. It was very good. Probably worth 4 stars in my book, but since I only gave this restaurant 3 stars your probably wondering why only 3 of you just said it's worth 4 stars. Well the reason I knocked it down was because of the service. Just not very good at all. Our service seemed irritated everytime we asked for anything. She only came to check on us 1 time during the whole meal. We had to get up ourselves and go to the kitchen to get a side of sour cream and our own napkins. I'll try them again to see if maybe she was just the bad apple of the bunch. ",0,0,1,0,0

To keep it simple Ill just bullet point my experience below. 1.Walked in for breakfast. Saw an employee sitting at a booth eating McDonald's breakfast. See four other employees standing doing nothing. 2.Looked at menu and ordered breakfast burrito and side of ham steak, listed on menu for 3 dollars. 3.Told they don't carry ham steak. 4.Change it to bacon. Ask about what the ""bread basket"" for 10dollars is. Told they only have English muffins now. The rest didn't sell we'll. 5.Finish order and choose to eat outside. Proceed to walk past the employee sitting at the bar drinking beer and watching basketball. 6.Wait for 20 minutes for my breakfast burrito. 7.Look around at the restaurant where no food is being delivered during the 20 minutes. 8.Begin to breathe smoke as employee drinking beer at bar decides to light up cigarette. 9.Wait 15 more minutes for food, only being asked how I'm doing once. 10.Get food, which was fine. Just ok. 11.Watch another employee behind bar texting her BFF or something. Had to get up and ask for silverware. Was pointed to where I could get it myself. 12.Finished food, getting asked by what looked like the janitor (he had been cleaning the metal around the bar, sweeping, etc.) how my meal was. Was tempted to leave him the tip instead. 13.Walked out without tipping and wrote yelp review, then wrote fat burger Vegas off my list. I suggest you skip steps 1-12 above and start right at step 13.

 They will forever be my favorite place to eat when I'm wanting pasta! Let's start with the bread. It's alway fresh and the butter is easy to spread Then the salad is great with the pesto ranch yummmm! Every pasta I have gotten I've never been disappointed with. My favorite is the mizithra cheese on one side and meat sauce on the other. AMAZING! ",0,0,0,0,1

 My hopes weren't too high- it's a hot dog chain, they have good prices, and I was in a frankfurter mood. Hit up the drive thru and service was quick but a bit brusque. Received my 2 mustard dogs for $2, and went on my way. As I unwrapped my first dog, it rolled out of the wrapper and splattered mustard all over my work outfit. I wasn't trying to juggle the darn thing, I wasn't multitasking, it was a disaster. Even the second one, which I was more careful with, was a gigantic mess- mustard everywhere. I don't understand what the staff is doing with the wrappers if the mustard is getting all over the place. Also, even for $1, my expectations were a little better- when you specialize in a niche product, it should be better than what I can get for the same price at a gas station. It's not. The junkyard dog will still be my go-to, but I'll be hitting up another location to get my fix... somewhere that won't require me to do my laundry after getting a simple snack. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I will give the warning that I didn't actually get to see a dentist here. First of all, there was some discrepancies about when I should show up for my appointment. When I first scheduled my appointment, I was told to show up 15 minutes early which is the time that I put in my calendar. When I received my reminder phone call, I was told a time that was 20 minutes later than what I put in my calendar. I thought it was strange but figured I must have made a mistake so I showed up at the later time. When I got there, I had tons of paperwork (btw....since when does the dentist need your social security number?) to fill out which they seemed annoyed that I didn't show up earlier (even though they told me to show up later). They also hadn't sorted out things with my insurance company. They insisted that they could not bill my insurance company and that I pay up front and ask for reimbursement later. I thought this was very odd so I insisted on calling my insurance company there. This whole process ended up taking so long that I ended up having to reschedule my appointment. It took me just a few minutes to sort things out with my insurance company once I got home. I just wish that if they had issues, they would have called me to let me know ahead of time so I didn't have to worry about it when I got there. I will add that they were very kind about letting me bring my bike inside since there's not really any bike parking outside. But, I think I'd rather go to a dentist office that has their act together and is a bit more organized. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have known Aaron for about 4 years now and I would highly recommend Aaron to anyone looking to purchase or refinance a home. I referred a client to Aaron and she was very impressed. He stayed in contact with her and kept her up to date on the process. She even thought he was ""Canadian"" because of how nice he was. Aaron keeps his clients' best interest in mind. He helps them stay responsible in their lending so that they can enjoy their homes for years. ",0,0,0,0,1

 All the other Auto Bells are pretty good but this location has slipped hard.. This the second time I have spent $30 and got nothing for it . I had to ask the guide to vacuum the plastic empty door pockets full of dust and sand when I took my moms car in they did not wipe down the where the seat is adjusted and they didn't even vacum the back seat... It's an older car but the place was dead and I did tip prior to service and it was just some crappy $3 or $4 either. I'm pretty pissed I got tired of telling him where he missed and just left so here are some pics.. Should just wait for my 8 year old step son to come over next time and give him the $30zzzz ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was first introduced to Dutch Bros. about 2 years ago, when a new location was built right down the street from me. They were offering free drinks for their grand opening, so I thought I'd give them a try. I ordered the most chocolately thing on the menu (double chocolate mocha - I had mine blended), and I was hooked. When I moved almost a year ago, I was heartbroken because there wasn't a location close to me. However, this location (Thunderbird), is somewhat close to me - it's not super convenient, but I'm willing to go a bit out of my way - that's how much I love their coffee! Now, about the location itself. They have two drive-through windows and one walk-up window, all of which are almost always busy - likely a combination of how amazing their coffee is and because they are located right off the 101 freeway. The employees are always super-friendly - I've never had a bad experience with any of them. A few times I was charged incorrectly or they forgot my stamps, but they always make it right, no questions asked. I stop by at least once a week (more if I'm feeling stressed or needing a boost). I also sometimes order the chocolate chip muffin top as a breakfast treat to go along with my coffee. In addition to the great prices, excellent service, and great coffee, they also do many promotions and fundraisers. This is a great company that I hope is around for a long time! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I have been going back and forth with myself whether to give this place 2 or 3 stars but Joe, the instructor in the Lamborghini Gallardo was really good and turned the experience around I think. Read the full story below or if you just care about my tips the very last paragraph. Had I only driven the Ferrari this place would get 1 star. I had 2 different instructors in the Ferrari as the first (very old dude - the oldest instructor I saw) made me turn out and then had somebody else 'deal with me'. He didn't like that I in fact tried to push the car - not to its limits but to my limits. We had no incidents but I did not shift as they tell you at 6000rpm (which is a joke) but rather at 7500. I also had put the F430 into race mode (w/out him noticing) which stiffens the suspension and increases the throttle response - this seemed to be too much for the old geezer. Anyway - I would not recommend driving any of the Ferraris with them - they are overprotective of these cars and ruin the experience to be easy on their cars and make even more money - disappointing. The Lambo however, or better the combo of Lambo and Joe made this lots of fun. Had I only driven the Gallardo it would have been a 4 star rating. 5 star is out of the question since this is way overpriced and 5 laps really means 4 laps plus the way in and out of the pit. It is a 1.1mi track so they are making bank charging up to $399 for 5mi. To sum it up, it is worth the experience to go there to hear the cars and I would say driving one of the easy to drive cars (GTR, Gallardo, R8) is fun as the instructors are less freaked out. Driving the interesting cars (Ferrari) will not be fun unless rolling around the course is enough for you for that price. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Whenever I'm off on Wednesdays, I try to take my nephew to the storytime they have here. Best of all is it's completely free! The staff is so friendly and great at reading to the kids. So fun to see all the kids read along and sing along. Always great to get kids imaginations running so early in childhood. We like to borrow books and DVDs after storytime. Not to hate on other libraries but, this one is so new and clean. It's easier to find books and dvds because of this. They don't seem so compacted into a small space. ",0,0,0,0,1

 The boyfriend and I hit The Greene House on a Friday night and it was a great place for a casual, but not too casual, Friday date. Even though it was Friday we were able to get seated right away. We decided to get a few things to share, that way we could try a couple different items on the menu. We started with the mac and cheese with sausage. It's kind of like an adult version of macaroni and cheese with a hot dog. The mac and cheese is tasty - very thick cheese. The sausage is a link served on the side, cut in half which was perfect since we were sharing. The sausage had a little kick to it but was not super spicy. A nice compliment to the cheese. Next we had the twin Kobe burgers with fries. They put it on two plates so I think we got extra fries which was cool. The burger was delicious. So tender and juicy and had that good burger flavor. They are small like a slider so if we hadn't been getting multiple dishes I could have easily eaten both. The fries were good too, thin and crispy with lighten herbs on them. For desert we had to try the donut. We are both big donut lovers and this one didn't disappoint. It's an oversized sugar donut served with a large donut hole. Definitely big enough to share. On the side is a vanilla and raspberry cream sauce for dipping. It's kind of like a reverse jelly donut. The donut came out warm and soft and was delicious when dipped in the sauce. A great choice for dessert when you want something a little out of the ordinary but nothing too weird. My only complaint about Greene House was the noise. It was very loud in there so it was a little hard to carry on a conversation. The place isn't that big so we were surprised at the noise level. If it hadn't been so hot out we would have sat outside. Oh well, next time. I would love to go back and try some of their other dishes. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I hate capitalism. HATE!!! This place is the epitome of all things that disgust me about living in a capitalist country. It's huge and full of everything outdoorsy, including a whole table of long-sleeve, button-down shirts with tractors all over them. At the entrance you have to pass through an amusement park-like turnstile. Are you kidding me? Sections are divided by activity: boating, camping, fishing, hunting. Ugh. A city girl like me is completely out of her element here. And, yes, it is as extravagant as a Las Vegas Casino. The condescending jerk in the camping section treated me like an idiot for asking if there were any Kleen Kanteens still available. When I pointed the label on the empty shelf that clearly designated this steel water bottle, he changed his attitude, but they still didn't have any. Next: shoes. I needed Teva-ish sandals for walking through rivers in NC. Flip-flops: $30+, Sandals: $40+. Luckily I found a salesperson who was nice enough to point me to the sandals on sale for $20. Checkout - they ask for your phone number. Grr. By the way, if your interested in ""culture"" they have a 4th Friday Artwalk notice listed at the mini-stripmall behind this monstrosity. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Good morning my fellow Arizonian foodies..... So by now you realize not only am I a PICKY person but I am proud to say I hail from Chicago and grew up eating at little breakfast dives. When we moved here to Chandler I had hoped to find a good breakfast dive to start the day out right. Our first day here we noticed Hoosiers and were so excited to give it a shot. The first experience was ok. The food wasent the greatest...by a long shot but the service was friendly and quick and the atmosphere was comfortable and reminded me of the midwest. We tried again a couple weeks later and noticed, as we did on our first try, that the potatoes,bacon and biscuits/gravy, while good, were warm at best. I am one who enjoys my food HOT (temperature wise), so by the time I am finishing up it is still a little warm. The potatoes and bacon tasted as though they were made hours earlier and they forgot to heat them back up. I tried a chili cheese omlette today and must say, I was happily surprised that it was quite Yum! It had little green chilis that gave it a sweet taste with a nice bite. I realize we live in Arizona where people think it is warm year round.....uhh uhh...not the case, it gets downright nippy in the winter and the restaurant is all windows and I froze all thru breakfast....guess theres not too much one could do about that, just bring a hat, gloves and a scarf and you should be ok :) . Anyway, not too much more to say about HOOSIERS.... its an ok place with ok prices and ok food I would have given it 2 stars ( ehhh, I've had better) but I have yet to find a really good breakfast dive in the area and MATTS BIG BREAKFAST is just too far to go.....so, you get 3 stars out of default! Go and give it a try...lets see what you think and in the meantime....... Bon Appetite' and stay warm ",0,0,1,0,0

 One of the best places to bring visiting guests. Go early as they do not take reservations. Happy hour is 3-5 T-F with buck 50 tacos. Long story short....although the tableside guacamole is ""fun"", skip it so you have room for everything else, including the churro dessert. Portions are not enormous, but decent.This is not your Americanized Mexican restaurant. Everything is gourmet and fabulous, with attention to detail. I don't consider $20 for an amazing entree to be too expensive. We usually go here only for special occasions, or if we have out of town guests. I'm hoping we'll go once a week until I've had everything on the menu! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Great shaved ice and the cookie jar shake was sooo good! Very unique ingredient combinations for the milkshakes.

I love the look of the place and the sparkly floors add a great touch! I hope the business succeeds and the only recommendation I would give them is maybe add a few more flavors for the shaved ice. :) ",0,0,0,0,1

 This was more filler food than anything. The ""Joe"" omelet I had was really bland. I had to dump lots of cholula sauce on it in order to taste anything. All was not lost though as the side of fresh potatoes chips was decent. Just had to dab it a few times with a napkin to get rid of the grease. If you're needing volume to refuel in the morning this is your place...but if you're more into tasty meals look elsewhere. ",0,0,1,0,0

 + Awesome service + delicious steak + thin crispy shoe string fries + super fluffy cinnamon sugar donuts + heirloom tomato salad with basil - YUM + border crosser (shot of tequila + beer) Came here with friends in hopes of delicious delicious meat. They change their menus so what we were hoping to get was no longer on the menu, sigh. However, the manager came buy and said if we ever call in a day before hand they'll be sure to make it for us - score. Our group ended up ordering various steaks topped with eggs and frites, and I ordered the lobster pasta. Everything was delicious and freshly made. But my favorite was the donuts, seriously something about that light and fluffy dough coated in cinnamon sugar. Plus it comes with 3 dipping sauces (chocolate, caramel, berry compote) OMG.

 Remember the Draw Bridge? Well that's where this place sits. This place is a rip when it comes to prices. Do it yourself for 18 bucks or spend 50 here. There is an upside though, the inspectors are kinda lax so you can usually slide through with a little bit of tint and what not. *wink! Don't hold me to that, it's just been my experience in the past. They have very friendly employees.

 Beautiful decor, super friendly staff, but it's a chain... Typical italian fare and a brunch menu, so we tried both. We had the french toast which is better at IHOP or any other breakfast joint.

The chopped salad was ordinary. We won't be going back. Once is enough. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was born and raised in the Phoenix area and I always laugh when people make comments about the ""quality of Chinese food"" here. Are you kidding? At this moment there are more people of Chinese descent in the San Francisco airport than in the entire State of Arizona. You aren't going to find the same food here as you will find in places like San Francisco and Vancouver. It's simply not going to happen. But, if you've got a taste for Americanized Chinese food, this is a good choice. I'm confused by the ageism demonstrated in some of these reviews. I haven't noticed that a lot of old people eat here, probably because I don't care. Heck, I'd rather be surrounded by people my parent's age than a restaurant full of young children with noodles hanging out of their mouth. I've always had consistently good service and good food at this restaurant. I'm certain you can find better Chinese food in San Francisco, but Jade Palace is much closer. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I am having a horrible experience with San Tan Eye care. At first I went in for a routine eye exam and then I called the Doctor back and asked if I should try contacts. I was told that my insurance covers the exam and I should check it out. Over the next few weeks I tried all 4 brands of contacts they carried and nothing worked. Fast forward 3 months and I get a bill for $90. I called back and they told me that my insurance doesn't cover the exam if I don't buy contacts. This was never told to me when I asked if I could try them. They still are charging my insurance for my eye exam and they refuse to drop the contact fitting, even though they told me it was covered and we tried everything to make it work. Even a reduction in their inflated cost would have been acceptable. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I stumbled on this place because it was close to my hotel while I was on business. I couldn't believe my luck! Everything I ordered was delicious. I ordered the citrus spare ribs, which were so good that I ate the leftovers at the airport the next morning (that's saying something, for a business traveler!), and the lemongrass noodle soup, which was so generously portioned (and packed perfectly for takeout so the noodles didn't get mushy) and amazingly flavorful! The broth was to die for and I'm usually a little underwhelmed by pho broth. I also went a little crazy and ordered the autumn rolls, which were fresh and tasty.

 To all who love this restaurant, I offer an apology. It's been several hours now, and my ability to taste is just returning. We have been waiting four months to try this new Szechuan place, and now... well. The reviews were universally good, one might even say great. So we were excited that we found ourselves in Chandler and only a few miles away. We weren't starving, so we decided to order light. I spied the Spicy Wontons on the menu and thought they would go nice with the Hot & Sour soup. While my friend ordered the Beef Stew and Pot Stickers. First, bare in mind that Miu's idea of a small order of soup, is one that comes in a huge, one quart bowl! No way anyone was going to finish that. I asked for some hot oil from our server and took some pictures. The soup was very good, though not very spicy. So I added a teaspoon dollop of the oil to my bowl. Nice! As for the Pot Stickers, they were deep fried, not pan fried and somewhat bland. Next up was my Spicy Wontons. They looked very much like some wontons in hot oil. I tried a few and found the dish had an odd taste that I couldn't place. Saffron? By my third wonton, I couldn't feel the inside of my mouth and everything just tasted like sand. The dish itself wasn't spicy, maybe a 6 on a 10 scale. But I haven't been able to taste anything for the last five hours. It was like a trip to the dentists office, everything was numb. I hope someone else might be able to identify the mystery spice or ingredient. We may be back at some point, but it will be a long while before we do. Sorry! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Like so many others here I agree that it was good years ago but not now. If you read the inspection reports on the Maricopa County website you will see why. They got caught mixing their salsa in a bucket with an electric drill and a paint stirring attachment! They were also cited for numerous infractions including spreading food borne illness, roaches coming out of cracks in the kitchen walls, etc. The food is not always fresh and more than once we have sent back dishes because the meat was so rancid you could smell it a foot away. Beware of the salsa if it appears to be bubbly, that's from gasses coming from bacteria in the salsa. Now I have another more serious complaint. They posted an unauthorized charge to my card on our LAST visit, (by last I mean final as well). Whether it was fraud or a clerical mistake I don't know but you need to watch them closely. My recommendation is to find someplace else. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I loved this little place. It was on my to-do list for awhile and a day of working at Edinburgh Uni meant I was in the right location to finally pay it a visit. It is small and I would guess at lunchtime, being able to get a seat or not (and the weather) would determine if you would eat here. The rain was bouncing off the streets but given that it was around 3.20pm when I was having a very late lunch, then I got the large window seat. Great choice of soups and perfect for veggies and gluten free peeps. Being GF, I thought I wouldn't be able to get bread but they toasted some GF bread for me so I wouldn't miss out (I LOVE it when places do this!). I opted for the mushroom soup - I know, I know, yelpers are not a fan of the humble mushroom, but as this is typically a soup which is (commercially) full of evil wheat flour, then it was great for it to be an option. It was lovely mushroomy soup and some little bits of mushrooms, all lovely with hints of pepper and garlic, not overly creamy but just really good soup. I was about \ u00a33.60, I think for soup and bread. I loved my pot (I went for a little one but still a decent sized portion) and when I'm working in the area again, I'm sure I'll be here for more soup. The choice is so good and lots of great combinations so I'm sure my biggest problem will be, what to choose next? ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've experienced better. It's called Rula Bula. It's right around the corner. My distaste for this place began a week or so before I ever set foot in the establishment. My husband and I were with our kids, walking around Mill and walked past the restaurant, where they had an employee standing outside trying to rally some business. We ended up having a short conversation with her in which she stated that we should come to Robbie Fox's, ""the only authentic Irish pub in Tempe."" To this, we replied, ""Haven't you ever heard of Rula Bula?"" ""Yes,"" she told us, ""this is better."" My husband and I have been faithful Rula Bula patrons for many years. I couldn't imagine anyone in Tempe having better fish and chips than them... ...but, for some reason my curiosity got the best of me and I stopped by Robbie Fox's for a late lunch one afternoon when my daughter and I were out walking around Mill. I had a hankering for fish and chips and figured I'd give it a try, even though I knew it probably wouldn't compare to Rula Bula's. I was right. Not even in the same league. Even the chips were inferior. Their ""chips"" are more like shoe string french fries which I'm not a fan of because there's so little potato to them. Their tartar sauce was pretty standard, again, inferior to Rula Bula's. The service was good, and normally I like it when the waitress gives my daughter a little attention, and acknowledges her undeniable cuteness (okay, maybe I'm a little biased) but this waitress seriously wouldn't leave us alone. Give me some space, I'm eating. At the end of the meal, she brought my daughter a bowl of ice cream. Although it was a very nice gesture, my daughter hadn't eaten more than two bites of her food, and I really hadn't planned on giving her any sort of sweets. While free food is always appreciated, it's best to ask before you put a bowl of ice cream in front of a toddler. I don't think I can betray Rula Bula again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Baja Miguel's has been a local favorite of our family for about 7 years and we've been steady customers. We've always enjoyed the food for the value and we've referred countless friends to the restaurant. We ate there tonight for an early Father's Day celebration. We were shocked to learn that when we requested more chips and salsa, we'd be charged $7.95 for the next round. Huh? Then my mom requested a little extra lettuce with her taco and she was informed that would cost $1.75. At that we asked for the manager. We have never incurred such charges before and the manager, who was not the regular manager we're accustomed to dealing with, told us they have been charging for those items for a long time. Wrong! We have never once been charged for extra chips and salsa or for a little extra lettuce. Although we enjoyed our meals, to the tune of $80 with tip for 4, I don't think we'll be coming back here any time soon. I understand times are tough, but come on! We're not the type of folks who complain about paying money for decent food and we tip well. But when a restaurant starts being so tight about every little item, it takes the fun out of going there. Too bad. ",1,0,0,0,0

 So glad we stumbled upon this place. It was our last night ""out"" in Scottsdale for a brief vaca and I wasn't in the mood to go crazy. Its dark and cozy with casual live music and a fantastic wine list (almost too big as we couldn't sort our way through fast enough). I'm kicking myself because I can't remember our server's name but he was superb as well. We inquired about some birthday shots being taken at the adjacent table. He informed us it was their house shot and gave us a couple to try on the house. It was delish so if you're in a shot-taking-kinda-mood, inquire and you shall receive. The other thing to know is that this joint is considered a speakeasy. The door way is not facing the street but is in a breezeway behind the building and the windows are painted so those passing by can not see in. I love this concept but wish it was like some more authentic places I've been to where you need to be on a list or have a password to get in. Not a big deal and they obviously don't do that so more people can join and bring in $$ but I just think it would make it even more cool. ",0,0,0,1,0

 For the price, I expected more. The ambiance was not as impressive as I thought a roof top restaurant would be. The hostess was unattentive and the staff did not treat us as valued guests. Not to say the service was bad, but that there was nothing to write home about. After telling the waitress that we were celebrating our anniversary, we never once received as much as a congratulations from her. We had to wait ten plus minutes to even be acknowledged, and then we had to repeatedly ask for our water to be refilled. The food was delicious, we had the chorizo stuffed dates and kimchi rice for appetizers. For our main course, we had the lobster tail with corn, fingerling potato hash, brussel sprouts and bourbon glaze, and vegetable chow main. My girlfriend is a vegan, while we did not expect to be blown away by vast vegan options, there wasn't so much to select from. The waitress was not knowledgable with the menu, and was not able to recommend many options for us. Overall, this was a decent yet far over-priced experience. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Met some clients here for dinner during the week. It wasn't crazy busy as my previous visit which was kinda nice. We started off with the Do Dheag Wings - 12 wings, 3 different ways - bbq, hot sauce & lemon pepper seasoning along with crab cakes which were solid starters. We also ordered dinner ala carte. I was in the mood for something different and went for the Irish stew - braised lamb, potatoes & other vegetables and came with homemade brown bread. The stew was hearty tasting and was really satisfying. I also tried the bangers and gravy which was yummy & could be also a nice appetizer. Another tasty entree is the fish and chips. Service from our waiter was spot on and friendly. Mcmullan's Irish Pub has a locals atmosphere but I felt comfy and welcome! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Excellence. I just discovered this little eatery near our house. I'm blown away by the breakfast here! It's also been on diners, drive ins and dives. Definitely order the corned beef hash. It's fantastic ! There's a counter if you come solo and don't want to wait for a table too! ",0,0,0,0,1

 After reading other reviews about this place now, wish I would've yelped it before going! Like other yelpers mentioned, this places advertises as a ""cantina,"" which led my wife and I to believe to we were going to a mexican cantina. We were pumped to try a new mexican place in the area...we were misled! It is an undercover sports bar, and the restaurant side was dead. Fine...so we sat down, and as we checked out the menus, all they sold was typical sports bar type-food....and several types of tequila. What the heck? Are they confused on what type of establishment they want to be? I ended up getting the fish tacos, which were a bummer. They were okay, I've had much better before. Here's the kicker: the fish taco plate was $11.99...I was expecting 3 tacos with maybe some beans and rice? I got a plate with 2 tacos, a huge pile of lettuce, a few tomato cubes, and a small white scoop of what looked like white rice (I wasn't brave enough to try it...my wife did and said it was really salty and soggy). I thought maybe mexican fried rice, but white? I wasn't even full after we were finished. The server was nice and explained to us what was good as we ordered, but she didn't even thank us for coming in! I don't think I've ever had that happen to me before? Bottom line...expensive average food, it's not a mexican cantina, and service is alright. We should've went to the place across the street! ",0,1,0,0,0

 We live out in California, there are Vape and e-cigs shops all over and it's becoming larger then that in Orange county. Our visit to the I heart Vape store blew our minds. We couldn't really find any Vape stores in any of the places in or around the strip, only places we could find were charging 15 for juice which seemed pretty steep. On our way home we stopped by the I hear Vape store and had the pleasure of being helped by Leila and staff. They create their own e-cigs and juices there which gives them the power to create whatever their customers want. They had the best customer service and answered all of our questions and gave us the coupon discount they advertised in the LV weekly. We will surely be back when we make Vegas our new home in Dec 2013....just in time for New Years. Great meeting everyone at I Heart Vape. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I'm a huge fan of their Wednesday prices and really enjoy the selection of good quality produce at farmer's market prices. It's always a bit crowded and the parking lot is a disaster, which is why the 4 stars. Overall, people are super nice and friendly and the food is high quality/organic for really reasonable prices.

 On one hand, it was ambitious to be open on Christmas Day for dinner. On the other hand, they were simply understaffed and overwhelmed. Lots of customers (no one really wants to cook on Christmas), just a gorgeous looking restaurant. Good bar service, fast and attentive. But our poor waiter.....taking an order from a large table with difficult people (my relatives.....I'm sorry, God)....and having some manager type talking in his ear every 45 seconds. Oh dear. All of the food came out cold, overly sweet, just not very good. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I came to Charlotte from for business matters and stayed at this hotel. Walking distance access to stores near the hotel were nonexistent. The hotel lobby decor had a red, black, and white color theme. There was also a pool table that people waiting there can get a quick game going. Upon my arrival here, the front desk was not really busy as I thought. So check in here was fairly quick. I took the elevator to my room and proceeded to walk down the hallway. The lighting in the hallways seemed dimmed and visibility was not that great. When I walked into my room, it was nicely decorated with the hotel's theme. Downside, the room lacked lighting. The view from my room was just the back of the hotel, which was not much. Well I can't complain for the price that I paid for the room. It was an OK hotel. I was always out and about anyways. The hotel staff was fairly accommodating. A negative that happend was getting hung up on by a staff member calling the front desk. The good thing out of this experience was getting my cardio workout from walking from the hotel to downtown Charlotte. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Walking into an empty restaurant is always disconcerting. But I figured it was a weekday evening and the area was a bit dead beyond people at the nearby laundry mat. Immediately upon seating, our friendly waiter got our beverage orders. He returned also with chips and salsa. We soon devoured it all and he asked if we wanted more, which we gladly accepted. For dinner, I chose the Shrimp Fajitas ($12.50), which is served with rice, beans, and tortillas (corn or flour). I was quite surprised with how generous they were with the shrimp. There was plenty and I definitely had leftovers. The Husband ordered the Steak & Enchilada (your choice of what kind), and it also came with rice, beans, and tortillas. He was also surprised with how tasty the steak was, they used a good marination. The real surprise winner was the refried beans. The Husband was loving their version. It was good too, but I guess I'm a fan of refried beans in general (especially with a little cheese swirled in there). We also caught up on music videos while we had dinner. (You don't get to see music videos anymore!) Overall, pretty good Mexican food without breaking the budget. And of course, it helps when there's a coupon in the Entertainment Book. (They also have other coupons available since they mention that there will be a 20%(?) tip added to the bill before any coupon is applied. We didn't mind actually because the waiter was very attentive.) 3.5 stars Sidenote: They also have a menu for their cakes by the sheet, so maybe they get a lot of business that way too.

 I Have been hearing about Craftsteak forever and finally took the plunge. glad i went? yes. would i go back? maybe......let me start off by whats great. wine list. however this is a place to buy the bottle not the glass....the group i was with all prefer different types of wine so our wine by the glass selection was very limited. I had the surf and turf- filet and scallops. both were really tasty, simple but cooked perfectly and really generous portions. not the best i have ever had but right up there with the best. starters- ceasar salad (good but not great), mozerella salad(really good) , the bread was amazing. we had the white corn as a side and it was really really good- i dont eat corn so for me to say this is saying a lot. the potatoes au gratin though....meh at best. i think the real issue i have with Craftsteak is how completely overpriced it is, how uncomfortable the chairs are just really left me wanting more....and with so many other notable chefs so close I don't see a reason to return.

 This is a food court review only. This was my first time coming to this Costco because we were in the area. I wish now I had gone some place else. I looked up their number and called ahead to order a pizza. I do this all the time at the costco's by my house and have never had an issue. They said it'd be 20 minutes. I got there just 15 minutes after calling. I paid for the pizza while the wife and kids waited in the car as they do when we go to other costcos. The cashier said it wasn't ready yet but she'd let me know when it was done. I stood by and watched as several pizzas came out of the oven and went to others. Two pizzas sat there waiting for someone but they were there when I got there so I didn't think either was mine. After 15 minutes of standing there I started to get upset. I tried to flag down one of the cashiers as they were going back and forth only to be ignored several times and to wait a minute another time. Finally I had them check and my pizza was one of the two that had been waiting there since I arrived. I told the guy I had been waiting for 15 minutes and called half an hour prior and was told it'd be 20 minutes. I also said the other cashier told me she'd let me know when my order was ready but clearly didn't. A disinterested ""sorry, sir"" was all I got before he gave me the pizza and went back to man the register. I stopped by guest services to complain. They offered to get me a manager but my wife was texting me that the kids were screaming. They offered me a car wash which I declined because why would I want a car wash? I was upset about the food court. Either offer me my money back or a free soda or something that shows that you care. A little more empathy for having wasted 15 minutes of my time by not checking for my pizza properly or fulfilling the promise of looking for it would have been great. The line was actually shorter than what I normally see at other costcos so I'm not sure what the problem was. It leads me to believe that the food court employees are either not properly trained or don't care. Either way I won't be back and don't recommend them to anyone. The cold, soggy pizza wasn't worth the $10 and especially not the 30+ minute wait. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Went to lunch here today at noon. Entered from Scottsdale Mall (Park) side and it was very confusing. On a perfect day all of the sliding glass doors were closed and for a moment we thought it, Distrito was closed. After prying one of the doors open we were greeting to an empty restaurant with exception of one staff member who greeted us but asked if we were ""just passing through""??? (To be fair, the doors were all opened by the time we left and WHAT a difference this makes) After bellying up to bar, our drinks were taken and we were off to a good start. Questions were answered on menu, drinks taken etc... Strangely enough they had an ANT problem where we were sitting and had to kill off several. The friendly enough waiter helped. (Strange for a luxurious restaurant/hotel should have this problem). Chips were delivered right away and several minutes later, the salsa and guacamole we ordered. We had to ask to silverware and napkin set up. Again, strange that such a perceived top notch hotel/restaurant would not be up on this standard, given the place was empty, thought they could/would focus soley on us. FOOD however was TOP NOTCH. Had Pork & Shrimp/chorizo tacos..... Very good quality ingredients and very flavorful. You could tell they hand crafted each one, right down to the tortilla. Would go back for sure but maybe at night. Felt odd being only two in restaurant. Attention to some very basic details could put this in the 5 star category. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Live nearby and can't believe I haven't been sooner. Guess because it never seemed busy. Intimate place, great for couples or double date. Very good seafood at reasonable price for a higher end restaurant. Good wine list. G Try the most excellent creme br \ u00fbl \ u00e9e - one of the best in Madison as they add a little liquor to the sugar before carmelizing the top and it is outstanding. Also, sides are very good and reasonably priced. Service last Friday was excellent. We went in late, and they made us feel very welcome and not rushed at all, which is more than one can say for some of our other high end restaurants in town. ",0,0,0,0,1

 The Skinny: solid French pastries and breads (4) Service: it's counter-service, so nothing special but they have a plug in bar for your electronic devices (N/A) value: French pastries and breads in the neighborhood? Score! - the earth is truly beautiful! (4). The very first time we came to check out La Belle Terre we got there at opening. They'd barely pulled out the pastries and buns from the oven and we were eager to satisfy our carbaholic cravings. We ordered a small sugared brioche, an almond galette, a pain au chocolat and a quiche. As soon as we got those items in our hand, we dug right on it while the pastries were slightly warm and oh so delish! The pain au chocolat was nicely flaky with the chocolate slightly molten on the inside. Just the way it should be. If you notice in the pics, there's no sagging in the middle of the pastry because of the even layering of butter and pastry dough. The almond galette had tons of almond filling inside which is a major plus - I love almond filling. Again, the puff pastry held up with despite the filling inside. The blueberry strudel was really good and not overly sweet. The small sugared brioche was amazing - that lovely eggy buttery goodness fresh out of the oven was really wonderful. The only thing that wasn't up to par was the quiche lorraine. Although the flavors were okay, the crust didn't hold up to the moist filling and was soggy. I would not recommend getting the quiche here. Round two - we tried the Napoleon and a loaf of fig/walnut bread. The fig/walnut bread was okay but I felt the texture was a little too dense for me and could use a little more figs and walnuts. The Napoleon was pretty good - nice pastry cream with the layers of flaky pastry but not too sweet - although I feel like the previous pastries we'd tried the first time we came was better. Added to the things to try are the soups and sandwiches here. In addition to serving up some pretty good pastries, they also serve Peet's Coffee & Teas here which is a major plus. They also have free WiFi with a nice long power bar to plug in your electronic devices while you surf, sip and nibble your morning/afternoon away. What a neighborhood gem! For serving up a dose of France in the middle of the desert, this place deserves a 4 starred review. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Over a year ago I met an employee of Big Earl's named Shannon who worked at another restaurant and she highly recommended that I make the long drive from Scottsdale to try Big Earl's famous shakes and burgers. Because Shannon had provided top notch service and her previous recommendations were spot on, we finally made the drive from Scottsdale today and were utterly disappointed to say the least. At a restaurant known for its famous burgers, we decided to give one a try, but unfortunately were turned down the opportunity at 10:21 am (lunch) to order because they ""didn't want the wait time for a burger to effect other breakfast eating customers."" What??? The place wasn't busy at all and what type of burger joint refuses to sell burgers? Needless to say we would never recommend this place to anyone.

 Fittingly, for a shop that sells frozen yoghurt, Frisky always feels really cold and frosty. The door is normally wide open, the seating plastic and lacking in any comfort, and the walls stretch up for ages before hitting the ceiling - it definitely does not feel cozy. However, for all of the chilly feel, the frozen yoghurt is universally enjoyable. It's a bit on the pricey side, but if you get a large portion to share it's a bit less of a sting on the pocket. I love how there are loads of fruits and healthy things to top on your yoghurt. I suspect these are universally ignored and everyone heads straight for the brownie pieces and chocolate toppings. I know I do. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Well first of all, I wrote a very detailed review just as I was leaving this resort. Now I cannot find it on my profile. Does yelp remove reviews? This was the most confusing hotel layout ever. I spent a great deal of time there confused in the hallways. Which isn't really a bad thing, since I hike and run anyway. I was able to ""break in"" my new barefoot running shoes;) But when you are staying at a place for a conference, it gets a little old having to waste your small amount of free time wandering the halls. And hiking to the inconvenient parking lot, dragging suitcases long distances around all of the awkward landscaping islands, or across them, which would be even worse. I didn't see a shuttle. There was mold in the shower. Not a lot, but it was enough to make me notice the general level of cleanliness (fair). We wanted to eat at Kai, tried to get a reservation from our first day there but were not successful. There was an enormous amount of focus placed on sweeping and blowing the landscaping. Yet the hot tubs were full of leaves every time we went to soak. I loved their little nature path. I think it is about 3 miles total. I ran every night, didn't even need a headlamp. The dry sweet desert smell was wonderful and the view of the mountains and lights in the distance made for a nice ambiance. Loved the path lighting. (Ran on red light the first night just to get familiar with the path.) I wanted to visit their gym and maybe get a massage. That was totally impossible because the spa facility closes very early. I guess they assume if you are there for a conference you won't need to exercise in the evenings. WHAT??!! There was some sort of boat shuttle but I never could figure out where it goes. One evening we hiked to the horse stables, which was interesting. (Did not actually ride.) The conference rooms were very roomy. Nice bathroom facilities. Quiet, good audiovisual quality. It was a nice place for an educational conference. And, that's why I was there anyway, right? One thing which was annoying was that they kept removing the tea/coffee service. It seems half the time I went for hot herbal tea they had just taken it away. I guess it wasn't really a ""bad"" resort, but for the price I expected better customer service and attention to detail.

 When it's scorching hot on the strip Crystals is an air conditioned connection between the elevated walkways that offers some eye candy as you speed walk through it. It's an oasis of sorts, a place to daydream of things you could blow money on if you ever won Mega Millions. As you look into the stores with service people waiting on no customers you can only imagine how attentive the service would be if you ever stepped foot inside a store or two. If you know where to look you can see the signs trumpeting the building's LEED environmental status. But then it hits you, unless you are filthy stinking rich this is not the place for you. You quicken your pace and head for the exit, pausing briefly to check out the cool small airplane hanging from the ceiling before you step outside to the strip, breathe in the exhaust fumes from Las Vegas Blvd and realize life outside of Crystals is better without much of the stuff they sell inside. Crystals is a textbook of example of just because you can doesn't mean you should. MGM Resorts plopped this ridiculous looking architectural abomination on prime strip front property as part of the biggest privately funded construction project in America to date. It's a temple to excess, bad design, and wasted square footage. Walk through it once, looky loo, and then go find something better to do. 2 stars: 1 because it's air conditioned, 1 for the entertainment value I got by watching 2 women come out of Prada, toss their shoes and slide on their new pricey ones only to say these really suck after a few steps. They ended up digging their old shoes out of the trash. It was a priceless Las Vegas memory for me. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is my second time writing a bad review about the terrible experience I just had at Danny's. Last time, they responded to me and gave me a free basic car wash, which was nice however it did not fix the problem that they have at this business. I am a female in my mid-twenties. Almost every time I go to Danny's I get harassed to upgrade or fix all these things that the workers find ""wrong"" with my vehicle. Yesterday, they went to an extreme I never thought I'd see. As I was waiting for my car to be done, I heard them call my car name so I got up and the guy is standing there with my air filter and my oil cap. He tells me about my air filter which is nothing new because it's literally like clock work - I now know what they are going to say to me about it since they have to show me every single time. I would never, ever pay them extra money for things they ""find"" wrong with my vehicle because I have NO trust in their employees. So I told him no I don't want to do my air filter today.. not only did he not take no for an answer, he said ""No no no .. what if I did it for $20?""... I said.. ""No I don't want to do it today"". He replies with ""Well what if I did it for $17?"" ... I said ""No.. I really don't have money to do that today."" and he replied with ""Really? Come on what if I did it for $16? You sure? You really need it!"" - I felt so violated that this man would not take no for an answer, I had to literally stop talking to him and walk away because he kept trying to pressure me. As I walked away he said ""Who did your oil change last time? Whoever did it really messed up your oil cap .. here look at it it's broken here and here (he is showing me the cap in his hand) and I told him.. ""You did! I have the receipt in my car!"" The reason I kept the receipt is because last time I went to Danny's they forgot to put the sticker on my window to remind me when my next oil change it.. I have kept the receipt in my glove-box from June so I could keep up to date on my oil changes. The look on his face? He was SO shocked and embarrassed. Here is he bashing whoever did it because since there was no sticker there so he didn't think that Danny's was where I went - but it was and I STILL have the receipt to prove it. So what did he say? After the look of shock settled in on his face he goes "".......oh well um we don't have these"". REALLY? The reason he wanted to show me it was broken was because he wanted me to buy a new one from him. But the second he found out that HIS BUSINESS broke it .. instead of offering to replace it for free he just says oh well we don't have it so ya. The icing on the cake? As I walk to the cashier the woman working the registered giggled and goes ""He's such a sales guy huh!"" - So is this the business they run? They hire disrespectful snakes as their employees? And they back each other up? I am so disappointed in this business. I will be sure to spread the word about how they run are this location - it needs to stop. It is convenient to get a car wash while you get your oil changed, but trust me it is NOT worth it. Stay far far away! ",1,0,0,0,0

 La Bocca was quite delicious when my man and I dined their a few weeks back. Located right off of Mill and University it is surrounded by lots of happening places which makes it nice and easy for you to find parking somewhere then walk to a yummy dinner at La Bocca followed by walking to any of your other nightly adventures you and your friends may have. We arrived on a midweek evening around 5 or 530pm and it wasn't busy yet so we walked right in and sat at a comfortable lounge area with couches and a long table as opposed to a 'sit down' table. We ordered two beers (unfortunately its been too long for me to remember which ones but they were great!) and an order of their bruschetta. It was happy hour so the beers were cheaper. Their happy hour runs from open to 6:30pm! With the Bruschetta plank you get to choose 4 different types and you get two pieces of each. We ordered: 1- two orders of housemade pesto with fresh roma tomato's, 2-Mozzarella basil, qc oil and balsamic and 3- goat cheese and beets. I can't write this review comparing it to another favorite restaurant of mine BUT I will say I was disappointed in the lack of vegetarian options and the portions we got with the bruschetta. We were still hungry after we left. Its ok though! We have never tried their pizza's and from what I hear they are amazing. Perhaps La Bocca will need to be where we go for our pizza fix. Service was great and overall a good experience. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I just attended a wedding here in early June. DO NOT BOOK it in the heat of the summer! Even though the fountains' ambiance gave it that babbling brook sound, it did nothing to offset the heat. I was amazed no one passed out! They tried fans on the sides but they blew so hard, no one could sit near them or hear anything.And even though we were moved into the reception area after 1/1/2 hours of pictures, the room never cooled off enough with the amount of attendees..To make matters worse, after the cake was cut, we were asked to relocate back outside for dancing so the staff could clean up. It was still over 100 degrees out there at 9 p.m.! If you are going to spend that kind of money in the summer months in Phoenix, go with an all air conditioned venue for the guests to enjoy.And there were only two female bathrooms available for guests to use, so there were lines often. Now on the positive,the garden was very nice although the roof of the reception area was dirty and made it appear dark.I will rate the food as o.k.because they ran out of lamb kabobs,one of the three meats offered along with chicken kabobs and roast beef , the salad was a bit wilted, most likely due to the heat ,and some of the other dishes were dry. and finally, the mashed potatoes they served were instant.I did not dare try the sushi table in that heat.The staff was excellent, very attentive,polite and pleasant. They were working very hard the entire time. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I waited a little while to try this place because I'm not the biggest chocolate fan. Originally I was determined to have the churros with fondue, but UNFORTUNATELY they were out. So instead I ordered the banana tempura with chocolate fondue and toffee sauce. And my friend ordered the waffle fires and the lemonade granita. Banana fondue- This came in a Chinese take out box, my initial reaction was this entire thing was filled, but I noticed it was only half filled because the bottom half they filled with paper. I was a little irritated by this. However this is a classy restaurant where big portions do not exist. The texture of the breading on the banana was pretty crunchy, nice coat of panko bread crumbs, while the inside was the smooth soft warm banana. There were also 2 sliced strawberries on the side, which was nice to dip in the chocolate fondue and the toffee sauce was a better dip for the tempura banana. Waffle fies- this was quite good. Nice and crisp. Powered with coco powered and came with a sauce. My friend and I both loved it. Lemonade Granita- It looked good in the picture and Misti also recommended it. This tasted like a mint drink with lemon. Honestly, it was like drinking a plant with ice. We both thought it was disgusting. Too much mint and there was only a hint of lemonade. The service felt kinda weird and they sat us at a little round table, which we thought was only for coffee drinking costumers? Although I do like the next contrast of the browns and mochas, as if you're walking inside the office of the Willy Wonka Factory. Overall it was an ok experience. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The rice bowls are a yummy quick lunch! I have never eaten the sushi here because I am super, mega picky about sushi. Raw fish is serious people! I go in here on my half hour lunch break to grab a steamy hot bowl of chicken curry about once a month. Its not Japanese curry like I was used to eating for the majority of my preggers days, but it will do. Of course I no longer live in Japan either... The chicken is tender the curry is savory, and the rice is well cooked and not dry. You can get hot sauce on the side to spice to your liking. It has a lot of potatos in it, that might be the only thing I don't like about this curry. I miss Japan... I would even settle for Curry House Coco Ichibanya if there was one here. Okay my mouth is watering which means its time to go! Oh my Naughty Nielly always orders the chicken teryaki bowl and that is pretty good too. Xx, Reese ",0,0,1,0,0

 I'm not a huge fan of Firehouse, but somehow, every time we're in Old Town, we end up there. They have a huge patio, and indoor dance floor, a game of bags outside and they have a lounge area just inside the doors. I've only been here during the nightclub hours (9pm-2am). It's good for the young and single people, but if you're attached and over the club scene, don't go here. I'm just not into shouting to the person right next to me, because the music is so loud (the patio is not so loud though). ",0,0,1,0,0

 I was hesitant at first to come to STK (based on some of the reviews), but after trying it out for myself, I have definitely become a fan and will come more often. Found on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, this is the steakhouse to be scene at. The vibe definitely matches the hotel being swanky and trendy. The service was attentive and good for a steakhouse. The food - overall a good meal and price was reasonable for a steakhouse. Appetizers and salads - they are big on blue cheese here so if you are not a fan (like me) make sure that you ask that they do not include it on your dish. The bread and dip they give you is great (the bread has a blue cheese butter, but you can't taste it so I was ok with it - the dip is some herb based olive oil and it was phenomenal). The steaks - bone-in rib eye medium rare is excellent and pair it with the foie gras - definitely a luxurious meal with all that rich fattiness. This is definitely a steakhouse to come to celebrate a birthday or just hang out with some friends - I would not say its for a romantic date since the do play music (fairly loudly) and the crowd itself is extremely lively.

 I went there today for beer, not food, but I think it speaks wonders to the character of the staff and management (and perhaps owner). I inquired beforehand how the beer was ordered and was told domestic was $10,99, import 18,99 for 6 packs. I grabbed a six pack of Yuengling, and the manager or owner instructed the person with regard to something on how to ring it up. The cashier told me $18,99. I said The gentleman (manager or owner) said it was $10,99. He said that Yuengling is an import even though it is ""Made Here"". The manager/owner nodded his head in agreement, and than I mentioned that not only is it not an import, but its made in POTSVILLE PENNSYLVANIA. Long story short, be very wary of spending your money at this business, because I promise they are scamming the students in the neighborhood because of their ignorance. They should really be ashamed for trying to scam unsuspecting people. Luckily I know better, and now you do too! ",1,0,0,0,0

 You never know what to expect here. We've had some good cuts and some bad, but it seems like the good stylists don't stick around very long. Today was an ok cut, although the back was pretty crooked. You get what you pay for here and I'd probably give 3 stars if the review were based on price and cut alone, but when they refused to honor a valid coupon for a kids haircut and wouldn't give me a receipt from the register for my cash payment I left feeling I had been cheated.

 I frequently stop at this location due to the proximity to my job. At first, I was not too satisfied with the service. Twice they gave me a regular size drink and charged me for a large. I decided to give them another chance, the third time they gave me a drink without soy milk when I had asked for soy milk. The manager was super friendly and re did my drink free of charge from the 60 cent they charge you for soy. The reason that i keep coming back is solely due to the fact that the staff is friendly.

 If you're out for a Sunday stroll The Dalriada is a great place to stop for a pint. If you have the kids with you the climbing frame in the beer garden will keep them busy. Great sea views from the bar, restaurant and large beer garden. There is an enclosed patio area to the rear of the building for those who want to smoke out of the breeze or get a bit of sunbathing in. If its a windy cold day, stop in for some hot food. The Quiz night on Thursday is great fun. Food is served from Monday to Saturday 12 - 3pm & 5 - 9pm, Sunday 12 - 5 pm. Children welcome up to 8pm. Booking advisable, especially at the weekends.

 7pm... Wow He is right on time ... great.... All dressed up for once in my life... Stilettos, LBD, and makeup... its new for me ... I'm usually in jeans on a date :P walks me to the car... unlocks the door and walks around... doesn't even bother to open my door while I'm already there? O..K... As soon as we start walking up to this place I'm automatically excited, i can smell all the good things from inside :) the lighting is really calming and warm... we were seated right away.. it took a minute for them to get to us for our drink orders ... they had so many take out orders it was insane... so i figured it had to be good right?! in the mean time i learned that my date is a vegetarian... well that's cool and all but somehow it turned into me defending my right to eat meat... i was really calm about it and just let it roll off but i was annoyed... as soon as we ordered our food.. like the second the lady walked away he looked at me with the weirdest look ever and said ""Aren't you going to go and wash your hands?"" WTF!!!!!! like he expected me to just get up and make a dash for the restroom... do i look like I'm 6yo? ""um well dude... I'm sure we have some time... ill wait a little before i go and wash my hands... "" he continued to look at me like i was gross or something.... weird he got a Thai beer and i got my usual water with extra lemon :) and the beer was really good... I'm not sure what its called but if you translate the title to English it means brother... (he igoogled it) it had a nice flavor... and its the same price as a soft drink lol score! once we got our food i was soo excited! i got the sweet and sour chicken .. with steamed white rice... they had the pineapple, onions, green bell peppers and a new one for me... TOMATOES!! and it was delicious!! just amazing... he had something vegetarian... with noodles and broccoli... so the whole time throughout dinner he proceeded to laugh out loud with his mouth FULL of food... and talk really loud at me with his mouth still full of food... and i mean its about to fall out of his mouth... it almost ruined my dinner... to bad i was too focused on the bell peppers! mmmm then he proceeded to pick food off his place and put it on my mine to try... which would have been cool... if he didn't use his HANDS to serve it... I'm glad to know he had just washed his hands but still... really?!? once we were finished he got the check... then showed me and started bitching about it! it came to a total of $22 and some change... um two dinners plus a beer... man that's a great deal in my eyes... plus I've never had a date show me the bill before... isn't that like a man rule? hmm i thought it was... so he takes care of it and we leave... still with me opening all my own doors... :( and as the drive to the next destination he continued to belch out loud without covering his mouth or saying ""pardon me or excuse me"" or anything.... and kept talking about how he had to go to the bathroom ... i was horrified! End Result.... Good Food... Nice and clean bathroom..the soap leaves your hands SUPER soft and touchable :) The Service was nice... Nice atmosphere... Horrible date... Wish i had had better company :( oh and i Tossed out his number... ",0,0,0,1,0

 Come for the experience, not for the lard-saturated burgers and fries (unless you're over 350 lbs. and your meal is on the house). Upon checking into the Heart Attack Grill, nurses slap a wristband and cotton gown on you before escorting you to the cafeteria, where all the other patients are dining. The bf and I shared the single bypass burger + 5 strips of bacon (+ $1) (we can't share the double, triple, or quadruple), but ordered our own drinks. His choco milkshake had a piece of butter swimming in it, I had a Mexican coke in a glass bottle. The burger was bland and dry... luckily the bacon saved the flavor for me to finish my half of the burger. The fries were just as dull in flavor. For food cooked in lard, one would think there would be more taste... after all, we're splurging on the calories already... may as well make it savory! A cheap meal that can only be forked out in ca$h, but if you forget, don't fret, because the ATM in the restaurant charges a mere $0.75 service fee (unheard of and practically free in Vegas!) The meal was entertaining and all the patients were in high spirits, completely unlike a true hospital cafeteria. I would not return for their outrageously unhealthy and tasteless food, but this is a fun tourist trap for daredevils to try :) (those who finish the quadruple bypass get rolled out in a wheelchair) ",0,0,1,0,0

 Had dinner here and the food was good but the service needed to be improved. We ordered the Peking duck and it was delicious. The complimentary soup was good and the vegetables were tasty. However the biggest negative was the service. The waiters seemed like they didn't want the be there and looked like zombies. We had a 10% off coupon and when we showed it to our waiter, she told us to cut it out of the newspaper before they can take it. When they delivered the food to us, they didn't smile or seemed to acknowledge us. They just dropped off the food and left. I would not recommend this restaurant based on the service we received. The food was good, but forgettable. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I decided to come here because my business partner frequents this place often. The restaurant is located in Town square around the corner from Guitar Center, next to the AMC movie theatre. The good news is that the place is pretty healthy so I will be back since its so close to my work. But as far as mediterranean places go, its pretty standard fair. I had the chicken pita as well as the chicken kabob plate. Both were solid but not phenomenal. There's a touch of curry in the chicken kabob and it sits on a bed of tiny quinoa (not sure if its quinoa but same consistency). Also comes with small side salad and pita bread. It does get a little crazy around lunch so be prepared for a little hectic-ness when waiting in line..they only have one register. The service is pretty solid as you can tell the wait staff really cares about making sure the customers are happy. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I am giving this restaurant 3 stars because of temperature. I really do not like high end french food so if you are a foodie you should ignore my review. I was more cold at this restaurant than I have ever been other than in my grocer's freezer aisle. They brought me a shawl which was nice but it could have used a trip to the dry cleaner. But the fact that they have shawls on hand is also concerning as you think they'd just turn down the AC--obviously!! I think this is a good place for uptight guys in fancy suits - with cashmere jackets. Your dates will be cold...tell them to bring some fur. I ordered the squab bc it was the only thing on the menu I could decipher and it came very very rare. I guess that is how fancy people eat squab. I would have preferred a cheeseburger. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Great place to pop into right off Park Rd for your specialized beer needs. The owner and staff are very knowledgable about their products and will help you find what you are looking for as well as maybe help you find something new to try!

 If I could give negative stars I would. I stopped in with my friend this afternoon for an early cocktail. Granted, we were not dressed to the nines but we were dressed ok for the neighborhood, a biker bar and pawn shop on the block. When we walked in, we got the up down disapproving look from the gentleman at the door. We were directed to the bar. When we sat down, we were semi greeted by a surly old bartender, far past his prime. When I inquired as to what he would recommend , he stated a shot of whiskey or a bud light. That offended me to the core as I took that to mean I was not sophisticated enough for a martini, wine or a specialty mixed drink. I then inquired about a sparkling wine, his response oh YOU want a wine list? I replied yes I would. I happen to have a sophisticated wine palate. I was tempted to order a bottle of Dom, but could not get his attention to get served, not to mention all of the nasty fruit flies infesting the garnishes at the cocktail station. Needless to say, Me and my black American Express card will take our business to an establishment that would like to serve me in a clean environment with a smile.

 VERY difficult ingress and egress. It doesn't take an archiecture degree to see that whoever planned this one out has some issues.

 Good food, but witnessed the grill chef use tongs to put a raw piece of chicken on the grill and use the same ones to pull a cooked one and put it on a sandwich. MAJOR NO NO IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY!

 C'mon. This is MGM... one of the best casino/hotels in Vegas. And they house this? MGM should be ashamed. Granted, I could see this at the Excalibur or Luxor (and that isn't a dig; I love staying at the Excalibur), but the quality doesn't match MGM. It is way overpriced. There are coupons that shave a couple bucks off of it, or you can go with a package deal. Either way, CSI isn't worth it. It takes about 10 minutes to go through. You have these sheets on clip boards, and you go through ""evidence stations"" that are crowded with other people. These ""stations"" are like tiny puzzles that any moron with even a second-grader's logic could figure out.

 I don't see what all the fuss is about. We stayed at the Wynn one long weekend, and on Saturday night, the lobby area was SWARMING with carbon copies of barely-legals standing in a ridiculously long line in ridiculously high heels and ridiculously tight dresses just to pay whatever crazy cover charge there is to get into this place. What on earth was the appeal, i wondered. Well, we happened to get offered some tickets to get in sans-cover, so we went...regardless of the fact that I was grossly underdressed for the affair. There were two platforms where girls were just dancing in slinky outfits for all to watch, and the whole place was set up to make me feel like I was at a meat market. The loud thumping, the fog, the strategically placed, scantily-clad models, and the hundreds of people who looked exactly the same all getting drunk and ""on the pull"" (is that the British term for it?) created a very cliche club environment for me. The one cool thing was that an entire wall was missing, giving the ability to see outside and making you feel like you were at swanky outdoor club. Perhaps I'm just not social enough to appreciate a good club when I see one, but we stayed 30 minutes and then left for some jack^2 (black and daniels, that is). ",0,1,0,0,0

 If I were going to rate this based on ambiance, the restaurant would get a one or two stars. The bar area isn't bad but the dining area is just too white. The white tiles and the sea foam green back wall just didn't do anything for me. I'm not sure if they redecorated much after the previous tenant and the place just didn't feel cozy and comfortable. The service wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. We came before a 7:30 show and for an uncrowded restaurant, it took a long time to get our meal. I split a caprese salad with Rachel and it was just ok. I like my caprese with a little salt, pepper and balsamic vinegar and this version was a little too plain for my palette and I really missed the balsamic. The bread they served was also a little too crusty and chewy for my taste. A flavored/seasoned olive oil would have been a nicer touch than butter. I followed this up with the linguine di scoglio. Again, it could have used a little more of a kick. More red pepper flakes please. I will say that they were nice enough to replace the shrimp with mussels and calamari since I'm anti shrimp. Also, the pasta was cooked to perfection. Summed up: good but not great. Didn't live up to the hype for me. I've had better Italian for less elsewhere in the city. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The salsa was great, especially the green. The main course was just okay. Wife's soft tacos were a soggy, nasty mess. My burrito was not bad actually, the chicken was tasty. Rice and beans are BLAND; rice seemed too old, a little crunchy like it was left over from lunch. Overall, not a good place compared to other places in the same price range. I will go here again for the salsa and margaritas, but not the food. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Absolutely amazing. My husband and I went, We had Farm Burgers, garlic fries, onion rings, a milk shake ORDER THE MILK SHAKE, and a fried banana split sandwich. The food was amazing, the vegetables were crisp and perfect. I would drive the hour from one side of town to the other for this place any night of the week it was phenomenal. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Albo's is a standard for lunch, dinner, and hangover food. They have a carry out special: 14' one topping for like $7.50. Amazing if you are super hungry and don't want to think about what to get. Also their lunch specials for around $7 are great... yummy chicken fingers!!!!!!!!!!! Sometimes when they deliver they get stuff wrong... i.e.toppings or extras... but since I live so close I just walk over there and check my stuff before I leave. It's also nice to sit in the air conditioning watching the tv for a bit anyways. They are nice people, and if they do screw up on a delivery, they will come back and make it right. For a HANGOVER there is nothing better than taking one of their pizzas to bed with you. :) ",0,0,1,0,0

 Wow. Seriously, the best store ever for organizational freaks. I walked in and my heart started beating so fast. I was just so excited. The most memorable items for me were the mini tool box and the wall of containers. I have no clue why, but they were they best thing ever. I was completely in awe the entire time I was here. The only thing I want to say about this place is that it is awesome (times infinity). ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was in the area and craving Chinese. Sadly, in LV, the best I've found is Panda. But, occasionally, I get my hopes up for that little amazing hole in the wall. This was not that place. My husband and I ordered chicken fried rice, chicken wings, garlic chicken, beef and broccoli, and spicy pepper pork chops. I think each item was about $5. We just drove up and placed a take out order. The staff was nice. Everything seemed made to order. And, it was ready in about 10 minutes or so. The positives pretty much end there. Chicken wings were OK. Usually places deep fry the wings. This place coats them in a batter and then deep fries them. The batter didn't really add anything and I would have preferred them without. The fried rice was OK, except for the occasional piece of cartilage. My husband liked the spicy pork thing he ordered and the garlic chicken was really good, but not really garlicky. And, the beef and broccoli was just...gross. It kinda turned my stomach to where I couldn't really eat the other items. Neither one of us could even look at it. I didn't try it. It went directly into the trash. I love trying new places. And, I always root for mom and pop establishments. But, I don't know how this place stays in business. It was overall, a bad experience, and I wish so badly I had just stuck with Panda! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Stopped in Vegas again just for a night as we were making our way back home to L.A. Because our last visit was so outstanding, we did Bally's again... Truly disappointing from our first visit, and maybe our expectations were too high, but overall it wasn't TERRIBLE. The room we got was clean, but a used bar of soap was still in the shower from the previous guests. We got a nice view of the Venetian and the new ""high roller"" ferris wheel which was nice. No real complaints, but we won't be staying here for our next visit. It's just not as nice as the other hotels on the strip although it is in a GREAT location. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Decent, clean hotel. Conveniently located near Pitt's campus. It's a little pricy but that's probably due to the location. The biggest annoyance here is that the parking is expensive ($18/day) and the room key cards demagnetized very easily. I was there for 2 nights and my keys needed to be reset twice. The shuttle was unreliable; I would opt for uber or a cab over using the free hotel shuttle. ",0,0,0,1,0

 For some reason, I thought custard was going to be so amazing. It was rather good, but not the best cold treat I've ever eaten. First of all, the location is kind of shady. I would suggest going with a large group, especially late at night. It is in Downtown Las Vegas, in the AM/PM lot, kind of tucked behind it. Also, there's no seating and just a window for ordering. I would consider this a food stand, but even food stands occasionally provide seating. I got the Western, which was a little over $6. If you aren't sharing, I suggest getting the junior size. The caramel and pecans were flavorful. The custard was also good. I probably won't go back here. I personally prefer frozen yogurt over custard, but this might be something new to try if you like custard. ",0,0,1,0,0

 A wonderful piece of history. We did the tour and it is very much worth it. I recommend it to people of all ages, and to people who may not be all that ""interested in history"" because I am one of those people and I enjoyed myself immensely. They fire a cannon at 1 pm daily (One o clock Gun), but we came a little afterwards. Wear comfortable shoes because the cobblestones, plus the random spurts of rain, can make things slick. My favorite parts of the tour: - seeing the Queen's exhibit with the Scottish military history - seeing the Crown Jewels - looking out over the city from the castle walls. Worth a visit!! Allocate at least two-three hours, we walked through everything in a little more than two. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I arrived at Chez Boris at 9am with my kid in his stroller, and was delighted to find the place almost empty. When you have a toddler, you're always fearful of crowded places where your little hellion is going to wreak havoc and get you kicked out, or at the very least, scorned for all eternity with the burning stink-eye of the proprietors. Not so here. We went to the counter, ordered a coffee, two donuts, and a glass of milk, and pulled up to the big, well-worn couch to enjoy. I plopped the kiddo down and stripped off the ten million layers of outergear that one must dress your child in to avoid hypothermia in this city, and the barista/donutmistress brought us our treats. Fantastic. Crispy, hot, tender donuts with sugary topping, a nice drip coffee, and the milk was a hit with the kid. We sat there, eating our donuts, drinking our beverages, and giving a last read-through to the books we planned to return to the Mile-End library down the road, and I thought, this is as close to perfect as it gets. Afterward, we looked at the Snakes and Ladders game they had on the table, and studied some of the old maps plastered on other tables. Great atmosphere, great space (enough room for a stroller! hallelujah!), and great fare. They even open early enough to enjoy a treat before the library opens. Fantastic. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This is my husband and I's favorite restaurant. We go to this Kona almost every week. We've only experienced nothing but good things. There was only one time when one of my sushi rolls came out pretty pathetic but our server was right on it and sent it back to have it remade. The manager comped our drinks for us. We returned again the other night and the same manager gave us a complimentary dessert.

 We wanted to find a place open for lunch that was casual. My husband was craving a burger so we found Big Dogs (it was Christmas day). We both ordered burgers and they were delicious! Juicy, large and all the toppings were fresh (tomatoes, lettuce, etc.) (posted pictures of the food, but not sure where they are...check my profile maybe.) My 5 year old also had a burger and enjoyed it all. He is a big fan...as now when we drive by the place he yells ""Big Dogs!"" The service was really professional and friendly. The place is very clean and a nice casual atmosphere. We will definitely go back (this was our first visit). It was Christmas afternoon so the place was pretty empty. We enjoyed that it was this way! No wait, immediate seating and no loud noises. They were also playing highlights of football (especially the Steelers ;-) . We look forward to trying other menu items and would consider going to some of their events they advertise. Great burgers! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Despicable! I pre-paid for a table at The Bank through Vegas.com. My reservation included 2 bottles of champagne and 2 bottles of Vodka. When I contacted the club 2 days before the event, I was told that my reservation was not being honored. They would sit us at the busy bar instead. For anyone who has been out to clubs in Vegas, you know that's not the same kind of experience. Not even close. I had even emailed their Director of Social Media and the same guy who responds to all these Yelp reviews - with my concerns about the reservation. He assured me that the reservation would be honored and to just show up at the club on time. Then I speak with their head VIP host - who tells me I'm SOL. They don't care that I've already paid for a table and bottles... they won't be honoring it. He had no concern for the way that makes his business look. I called Vegas.com to explain the dilemma and they called The Bank directly. Nothing changed. The Bank still says it's a no-go. The lesson learned here is that nobody at this club can be trusted. When their Director of Social Media can promise a customer one thing only to have the club disregard it completely despite having prepaid for the reservation... it's just absolutely reprehensible. There's not a lot we can do to affect these clubs. The supply and demand curve is just so out of wack in this industry that the clubs can do whatever they want, treat you however they'd like, and charge you 20x cost just because! But we have to keep trying to make companies treat customers with respect. I strongly urge everyone who reads this to share this story with anyone they know who might be considering this club. There are other more honest clubs in Vegas that deserve your money. Don't give it to one that will toss you to the side the second a bigger opportunity comes around! Update 5/29 - after the trip: The Bank continued to give me the run around... so we went with Donnie E. at Tao and dropped 5 G's on a prime table on their stage with a perfect view of Snoop and Busta Rhymes performing all night long. Whatever you do, just stay away from the Bank and the shady criminals who run it! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Lots of money for not much quality. Yes, the ambiance was nice, but the focus of our trip, the food, was not worth it. I ordered the steak with the king crab. Kudos to the for actually making it lump crab versus shucking your own. However, it was so dry I had to ask for a replacement. They were quick to get a new fresh order out to me. It was fine, but did have shell mixed in. :( Another positive was that my steak was cooked to perfection. We ordered the Chipotle mac n cheese and the peppercorn parm mashed potatoes. Mac n cheese was flavorful and a great spin on a classic. The mashed potatoes were flavorless. Which made the dinner even worse... I was so excited to have them! In the end we thought we'd redeem the night by getting dessert to go.. carrot cake and turtle pie. We've yet to eat them, but regretted the order as soon as we got the bill... they were 12 bucks each!!! So in the end we spent $200+ tip on a meal that was worth maybe $100. This place has some cool factors -ipads for wine and dessert options and great service, but I wouldn't pay that much more for those qualities. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I love going to get my hair done at Boujis! It is so welcoming. While the salon is current with all the latest styles and trends, you don't feel put off by attitude. Dona, the owner, always greets you with a smile and knows you by name. One of my favorite things about Boujis is that they do not let clients walk back on a whim to talk to the stylists and interrupt them while they work. My time is my time! Okay, call me selfish, but I like having the undivided attention of Ainslie when she is working her magic on my hair! The other thing I love about Boujis is that the salon is light and bright, so when Ainslie colors my hair, we're looking at it with natural light, not the artificial light mimiced in many salons these days. Speaking of Ainslie, I give her an A+. I am a pretty easy client, and I like to change up my look, but when my hair doesn't need color, and I insist that I want it, she does not give in! She truly cares not only about the look she creates, but also the health of your hair. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Customer service fails!!! We place the order by telephone, order was 12 chicken strips, fries, beans, two blue cheeses, and an order of cheese sauce. After spending the 15-20 minute drive there and back each way (obviously not one in my area) open the sack only to find the sauces missing. What is the meal without the sauce. Called to complain, placed on hold, even spoke up and said I didn't want to be on hold because I had an order problem. On hold anyways. Hung up, called back and again said I had an order problem, the manager, Shawn, Swan or something said that the only thing hw would do is give me free sauce the next time I came in... What? No I'm not satisfied by getting free sauce that I have already paid for on my next visit. A bigger attempt at a discount or comp would have been the only way I was going to be satisfied. My meal was not complete. Very disappointed!!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I wanted to be all about this place, but, it fell a bit short for me. I've been to the Lucky Cheng's in New York, and I've been to Lips in NYC also. (Lips is the same theme Drag Waiters.) The drag dining event can be really charming and fun. But there's a huge difference between drag in NY and drag in LV. It seems that here in Vegas it's not so much drag as it is transvestism and pre-ops with boobs. I guess real boobs on a ""drag queen"" is a little too real for me. God I sound like a wuss, but it really seemed more like a bordello than a fun jaunty trip to a drag show. The show was fun. I don't remember her name, but this awesome queen with a huge Afro danced her way into my heart. She looked like she jumped right out of an R. Crumb comic......bodacious to say the least. She was dragtastic. As for the food. It was okay. Nothing to run back for, but prepared well. So, yeah, a bit underwhelmed by the whole experience. Now, word on the street is that Lucky Cheng's is moving to the Krave Lounge, which might give it a whole new feel. When it moves, I'll go again and see if my mind is shifted a little, but until then, i kinda feel like drag is dead. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is a great place to go during your lunch break or after a busy day when you feel like getting lost within many, many books! (Indeed, many lecturers from Edinburgh University have been spotted in here after a busy day in the lecture theatres). There is just something about browsing in an independent small book store which separates the experience from looking at a Waterstones or Blackwells. Located close by to George Square, this book shop is full of useful books for students of social and political science. As a political student myself, I found this shop to stock many specialist books which are not available at the main book stores. Books covering Scottish politics and left wing politics (This is a key feature in this shop as Jonny and Lynsey have already highlighted!) are well supplied in Word Power Books. The prices do not compete with discount rates on Amazon, but I really don't mind paying that when it is in an independent book shop! Keep the independent book shop alive, and dive into the literature on offer in Word Power Books! ",0,0,0,1,0

But at the same time it was nice because they weren't very greasy. I'm personally not a huge fan of thin cut fries. I like them thicker, I feel like I'm actually eating more potato than grease.

 The nightmare is almost over. I visited the Scottsdale location last week because it is so much easier to deal with this company in person than over the phone. I was there and worked with their staff to everything delivered after 6pm on May 7th. I received a phone call May 6th to confirm my delivery time of 3pm-6pm. I explained to them that it was supposed to be delivered after 6pm as i would not be home until then. I also explained to her that i was at the store and worked with the general manager to have it delivered after 6pm. That rep explained to me that it most likely would be after 6pm as i would be last on the deliver route. I explained that i wanted to speak to a manager and she stated that she could not get them out of the meeting. I explained then i would want one to call me back and she stated that it would be 24 hours for a call back. I said i was not happy about that and ended the phone call. On the morning of May 7th i received a call from a customer service manager stating the table would be delivered before 6pm as they could not deliver it after 6 because it wasnt set up that way. I called them back to get to the bottom the issue and talked to another customer service manager Josh at 2pm and he stated that he would see what he could do to get it delivered and called me back over 2 hours later and then stated that he could not have it delivered today and they would deliver it tomorrow night between 8pm and 12am. Meanwhile the delivery driver is calling my phone 10 times to tell me he was there. I phone living spaces back and asked to speak to Josh and was told by this rep named Elizabeth that he was not taking phone calls right now and she explained everything to me. She stated that there is no way that they were going to have it delivered tonight. I stated that i would go pick it up but i would expect them to process a credit for the amount of the delivery since i am having to drive and pick up the product. She stated that they are not authorized to do that but are authorized to credit $50 and deliver the next day. I stated that was not acceptable and told them i wanted Josh or Josh's manager Jackie and of course i went over 3 hours without hearing from anyone. In the mean i drove 30 mins to get to the North Scottsdale location and everyone in there remembered me and what i have been put there and asked how everything was. I told them not good and i was walked to the counter where the managers were. I spoke with AJ the general manager who i could tell was visible upset that i was being put there this again. Aj then got on the phone with people and tried to make this right. Needless to say i applaud everyone at the North Scottsdale location they truly are there to take care of the customers and make sure they enjoy their purchase and spending there money at Living Spaces. About 20 minutes later i got a call from AJ who let me know that he was able to get it delivered tonight. I was excited and then i get home and received a phone call from Josh the customer service manager who was supposed to call 2 hours prior and goes well i wanted to call you back and i see that you have gone to the store and they will be delivering it tonight. I said yes Aj was able to get that done since you failed at having it delivered even though i spoke to you before 4 pm which is your cut off for same day delivery. I explained to him that i would still expect the $50 credit that they offered me and said i am not sure if we can do that but i will speak to the store manager. He then ended the conversation. I am still wondering if i am going to receive a phone call back about my credit or not. But i am glad that this nightmare is over and my table is in my house. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERY SINGLE PERSON AT THE NORTH SCOTTSDALE LOCATION. EVERYONE IN THE CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICE COULD REALLY LEARN SOMETHING FROM YOU AND THE WAY YOU TREAT EVERYONE. AS FOR JOSH, JACKIE AND ELIZABETH YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO TREAT PEOPLE THE WAY I WAS TREATED BY YOU AND ALL THE OTHER REPS WAS DISGUSTING.

 A great breakfast spot, Cracker Barrel is one of the most consistent brands I have ever encountered. On this particular morning, I went with their new ""special"", a whole grain and granola pancake breakfast which also came with two eggs and a meat. Good Lord, that's a lot of food. I ate the two eggs (cooked perfect 'over medium' as ordered), a bite of the bacon (salty as usual) and barely half of the pancakes. I was stuffed. Service was good. The waitress refilled my coffee and my friend's unsweet tea often. No hassle that we were waiting on two others who failed to arrive. A slight bump at the register, but these things happen. Something about a check that wasn't closed properly meant that the clerk couldn't take a payment until it was solved. That took a few minutes to get the manager up front to override. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Terrible experience! Do not go to this restaurant unless you have time and and money to waste! We were giving this place another chance after the first time when we were totally ignored at the door. We ordered wings which were very good. So we were feeling good about this second experience. ....ordered one of the specials...a chimichanga and I ordered something called chicken montrechet. After waiting for 45 minutes, our food finally came. Husband took one bite of chimichanga and literally had to spit it out. The tortilla was so over deep fried that it was dark brown and hard. The ground beef inside was black and inedible. My chicken was okay but had to scrape the sauce off asit had broken and looked congealed and tasted awful. We tried to get the waitresses attention so that we could send the chimichanga back but we could not get her attention for another twenty minutes. So my husband sat there with no food while I ate my dry chicken breast and baked potato. When she did show up, she apologized and my husband he just wanted their sky high sandwich to go ($8.00). We left and when we got home, my husband was starving and wanted to eat his $8 sky high sandwich! He opened it and took a bite only to discover that there was still the paper that comes between slices of cheese on the sandwich. Not only that but the sky high had two pieces of turkey and two pieces of swiss cheese (with paper) and a soggy smashed bun. It was disgusting and so my husband did not eat that night! Tried to call to speak to owner but neither owner turned up there that night. Other than one other table that night, there was no one else in the restaurant other than all the senior citizens at the bar to watch the Cardinals game. This place calls itself a bar and grill but I now know why it was almost empty on a game night. The food is awful, the service is sketchy and wait time is incredibly slow. We will not go back and will warn everyone not to patronize this place. A couple had walked in while we were waitingfor our food and after waiting for about 15 minutes, they walked out. They don't know how lucky they were. The owner of this place owns a place in Sun City called Royal Cafe, a breakfast and lunch place. Maybe they need to stick to that! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Been here a few times. I like the ambiance of the place overall. I think I get frustrated by the food usually. I'm a big foodie so when the menu looks pretty good I'm let down when it's not quite what I conjured up in my head. Mind you the food isn't bad at all I fact it's quite good and apparent that someone in the kitchen knows ""how to cook"". Sometimes I'm not sure what it is but I think it may have to do with seasoning for the food. I once had the Mac and cheese and it was great but there was very low to no salt in the dish which left it incomplete and unsatisfying. No I'm not a salter, only thing I add salt to after cooking is my eggs and fries. That's it and in cooking many times I half what's called for in recipes. The wings are usually really good and like the different sauces available. Beer is yummy and cold. Last time I was their I enjoyed eating a bite and sipping a beer with my hubby and watching a guy try to pick up a girl, didn't go so well,..... To funny! Thanks Bricks! ",0,0,1,0,0

 McCarran Airport is a busy place! Once you step inside the terminal, check-in is relatively simple. Since I travel a lot, I give this airport 4 stars for the fact that it has TSA Precheck. Once you get to the terminal, the gates are pretty standard as far as convenience for a large airport, not great, not awful, but a-ok. If you live locally, parking is pretty convenient, a 6-floor covered garage next to the terminal. It has been a while since I've rented a car here, but as I recall the process is more convenient than most considering the size of the airport. Plenty of slots available to lose your money on as you wait to board, also plenty in baggage claim. What a racket! Fun though! :) There are also lenty of stores and places to eat. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I had VERY low expectations when I went... and was pleasantly surprised by how mildly entertaining the overall Chippendales experience was. A fun night with copious amounts of strong alcohol and lots of HOT gay [sorry to break it to you girls, but straight men just a.) don't move their hips that well and b.) keep their bodies so toned and well-oiled] men parading around in sexy tight outfits? FANTASTIC! We had seats in the front row, dead center.. which meant I was in the ""target zone"" and got 4 lap dances and a few kisses. I should've been excited.... but nope. I was honestly more thrilled by the expression on my best friend's face, her periodic blushing as she gushed about how hot they all were, and the fact that as soon as it was over, she said, ""Do we have time to come back here before we head to San Francisco?"" We didn't, sadly. But I know now where to take my girlfriends the next time we plan a trip to Las Vegas. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I thought the people inside Ashley's Furniture were annoying.... We stopped in here once when we were looking for a love seat. The sales guy was soo, sooo unbearably aggressive! We humored him and sat on what felt like every love seat they had to offer. He gave us some nonsense about how our back and feet have to be properly alined to promote good circulation.... I don't know what the hell he was talking about and he honestly would not STOP talking. What really stood out to me was the lack of la-z-boys! Where were all the reclining chairs they're famous for?? And the lack of leather furniture too. They used a lot of a cheap-looking imitation. I pictured them as being a bit more upscale, but instead I felt more like I was in one of those warehouse places.

 Here's a dissss-gusting one for you. Picture this.... 1993, Highschool, floating down the Salt River with a light buzz (who doesn't drink on the river? Even 7 year olds are plastered) and my friend asks me what happend to my leg? Why the bandaid? I thought that was strange... nothing happened to my leg, I didn't have on a bandaid. But I did.... it wasn't mine, it must have been in the water and it stuck to side of my leg with my ass firmly planted in the tube and my gams dangling in the water. UGHHHHHH... I almost threw up, but instead I drank another warm keystone light and made it all better. Never again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Brit and Chips offers five types of fish, each (not including the fish of the month) with its own unique batter - not including the Veggie Haloumi ""fish""; the fake, mock fish... the ""fockish"". I had the salmon in Guinness batter. Two generous hacked fillet of salmon, I had the ""with chips"" option on the menu; I mean what's fish and chips without the French fries, I mean chips? Then it would just be ""fish"" and that's not fun. Not that it goes without saying, but the chips were as honest as a 19th century British machine worker covered in soot - hard on the outside and pillowy inside; never call a factory worker ""soft"". Salmon has a tendency to dry out and become dense when overcooked - the fish was perfectly cooked, tender and flakey while remaining a blushing pink in the middle. You can't really taste the actual Guinness in the shattering batter, however, the dark, murkier and earthy flavours that a stout has is definitely noticeable after a few bites as the flavours linger in your mouth.

 Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits): 9 Food 10 Service 9 Atmosphere 6 Value I love this place because it's a little bit of everything. It has a great little lunchable cafe, a little wine bar area, and a little grocery area. The offerings are limited so it's not a good place for larger trips, but if you want some fresh produce or have a quick need, this place is perfect. It also carries Crave ice cream (a very rare thing) and some other local/artisan products. ",0,0,0,0,1

 The first time we visited a Crazy Mocha, they put ice cream in the coffee. Now THAT'S crazy! But they don't do that anymore. How dare they call themselves crazy?! They have absolutely NOTHING crazy to offer. Now that they got rid of this unique add-on (""it was such a hassle"" the barista explained), it's really just a run-of-the-mill boring coffee shop. I do like the convenience of the computers available inside...we frequently use these to check the movie times before heading to the theater. The roll-up doors are also a cool feature. But coffee-wise, it's basically a big ""eh"" from me. The service is okay at best...a recent Craigslist job posting from them reveals that they only pay their baristas minimum wage, so they do the minimum amount of work in return. At one location the barista kept going outside to smoke and chat with her buddy in between serving customers. I don't know...I love to support local businesses, but it helps if they have something unique or memorable to offer in return. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I don't usually write reviews of places at all, but after using Yelp to pick this place as a place to meet up prior to a Diamondbacks game based on the largely positive reviews, I had to come back and let people know not to believe the hype on here. I am a lover of food and rarely find something that is just plain inedible, but that's what happened with every course of my meal at Coach & Willies. We started out with appetizers including meatballs, Italian nachos, and a wedge salad for the table. The meatballs were actually pretty good and my girlfriend also enjoyed her wedge salad. However, the Italian nachos were just plain disgusting. They reminded me of those cheap $1.50 Totino's pizzas that you can get in the freezer aisle at the grocery. The ""chips"" were mushy on the outside and hard as a brick on the inside; the toppings were clearly cheap and tasted awful. For my meal, I ordered the bourbon steak flat bread wrap. It was absolutely inedible. I was very hungry and was only able to force down two bites of the sandwich before calling it quits -- something that is unheard of for me. Altogether, I hope no one else makes the mistake of going to this place and expecting the good food that people here have written about. The menu is rather large and maybe that's why they are having a hard time keeping the food at a high quality. If you go here before a game, I'd recommend sticking to the beers and then getting a hot dog at the field. ",1,0,0,0,0

 So I am writing my long over due review for my favorite hair bar & salon. I have been coming here for just under a year now and I have tried other hair bars but hands down platinum entourage is the best!!!!! I have seen just about all the wonderful hair artist at this place and they are all really amazing. I always get a shampoo/ condition with a blow dry and style, they will also put a scent in your hair too which will last and not just fade after your first gym visit. I should also mention that my blow out is not easy to do because I naturally have very thick native Indian/ Pacific Islander hair and I also wear a beaded sew in weft. These stylists though make it work and i always leave feeling like a beautiful women, I really can't say enough praise about everyone at this place. Thank you so much for making me feel great on days I just want to die. Please come see anyone of these amazing people. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This is located in Phoenix by Lincoln Road and 24th. It's about 1.2 miles to the top so you can get up and back within an hour. It's fairly easy - if you are used to doing stairs as you'll basically be climbing up a lot of them. When you get to the top, there are great views of the city below. The only thing you'll need to watch out for are people who are racing up and have no intension of stopping to let you get out of the way. If you hate stairs, try the circumference trial instead. Yeah, the name is totally not creative, but it's much easier than the stair one (even kids can do it) and you still get to see the city from way up high. Level: Easy to Moderate ",0,0,1,0,0

 Date of stay May 21 - 23 We managed to get a new room...20th floor...overlooking the strip. *The new decor , nice. *Beds, comfy. *Linens, crisp and clean. *Bathroom, beautiful but with bad shower. *HD flat screen TV with no HD cable?!?!? *Pool, AWESOME. They need to have more cocktail servers though. *Service/guest facing personnel, had a few ""rude"" encounter but service was good for the most part. Oh and if you go to Siegfried & Roy's Secret Garden, don't ask the Dolphin habit women anything. They're super rude, especially it seems, to guys.

Pleasant dinner at Onda...FANTASTIC Garlic Crusted Sea Bass...quite tasty Veal Marsala...unimpressed with service and my mixed green salad was limp under a thick coating of creamy dressing...ick! Carnegie Deli...huge portions of sub-par food (bland, dry rye. gummy Swiss. dry corned beef). Although the fries were PERFECT! Carbibe was decent, went for breakfast. They do a 1 item breakfast which is great if you don't want to stuff yourself. It comes with 1 egg, 1 slice of toast, 1 piece of meat and 1/2 a serving of hash browns. It hit the spot and I didn't feel bloated in my bikini at the pool! hahaha Gambling treated both of us well. At Roulette I put down $10 and walked away with $100+. Slots, put in an $18 credit slip and walked away with $300. I pissed away about $100 here and there so I'd say I actually WON about $300 in our 2 1/2 days at Mirage. Can't beat that! It paid for at least half the trip (& my boyfriend's winnings paid for the other half). All in all we had a great time at Mirage and would go back.

 Last month was my first time checking out their happy hour. & let me just say.. amazing!! Great prices on great drinks and food. Bahamaritas are my favorite. A must try! The sangria was ok.. not the best, but hey I drank it anyway. I also got a Blue Moon which I love. As far as food goes, we ordered most of the happy hour menu. Lots of food! The only reason I'm giving them four stars is because the service was pretty slow. It took foreeeever to get the check and then even longer to pay. But overall, very nice happy hour experience. I've been many times not during happy hour and I always get the jerk chicken pasta. It's soooo good! ",0,0,0,1,0

 A must for St Patty's day, although I recommend not going for the straight corned beef and potatoes. Good flavor for the corned beef but the cabbage nor the potatoes had seasoning nor butter.

 I just walked out of here $550 dollars poorer for a subpar massage and the worst facial to date. Granted, I don't particularly care for facials. I don't see the point in paying someone to repeatedly wipe on and wipe off various creams from your face. But after an hour of that, my face should be smooth, however fleeting the sensation. It wasn't. I paid extra for ""add-ons"" to the massage: an oil scalp treatment and a conditioning foot treatment. I made a point of asking the person at the front desk if these treatments added to the time of the appointment or merely took away from the massage. He had a really roundabout way of answering what I now know: that I paid extra for less massage. My feet are not particularly conditioned and I really could have done without the scalp nonsense. Oh, and the gratuity was mandatory. I certainly would not have given 20% for this. What a joke. ",1,0,0,0,0

 For its size, El Charro packs a punch. I've formerly only eaten in the restaurant here, which was always tasty. I was a quesadilla fiend for a while, and they always delivered (figuratively, not literally).

 Went here last night with some girl friends and had a decent time. Seems like everyyything that had alcohol in it was $6. Shots of generic tequila, draft beers, and mixed drinks. So if youre gonna drink, just get shots because their mixed drinks SUCK and their beer is warm. I asked for a long island and got nasty watered down juice crap. Seriously the worst drink I ever had. Long islands are supposed to be strong! I had to ask the bartender outside to fix it. Apparently she knows the bartenders inside cant mix for sh*t too. Music was mostly spanish, almost made me want to leave but then they played some good stuff for like 30 min. Nobody can dance by the way. Guys and girls. Lots of older ppl and lots of shaved heads.

 This place gave my friend and I (after asking if it was our first time eating there) EIGHT samples to try!! They explained the food is named after children-which I didn't really understand, but who cares it was SUPER SUPER TASTY! I really like their asada, and I think its called chicken jade or something like that..but you can have ANY of the items made into a burrito, a rice bowl, or a quesadilla. It's pretty amazing. I ordered #5 garlic chicken with onions and tomatoes the tomatoes were not really stewed more like they were baked with the chicken, nothing really overpowered anything it was a great balance between all the flavors, and on top of plain rice it was perfect! Atmosphere is fastfood dining, and they have outdoor seating for smokers like me. My friend ordered the Carnitas on top of their version of fried rice, which has meat in it -giving the rice a delicious flavor - just engulfed the plate in a matter of minutes, it was THAT good! Highly recommend this place, the items on the menu are extremely well thought out, the prices are amazing for the food you get -5.00 for a large plate!! AND you get your choice of cookie for desert..the chocolate one melts in your mouth, its gooey on the inside in some parts of it and sprinkled with powdered sugar. They brought our order TO us outside, which they didnt have to..As far as customer service goes, they are on it. I would say it's on a gourmet level in a fast food wrapper.

 Oh dear. I was totally underwhelmed by the customer service and quality of food here that I really can't even justify an 'A-OK', although based on the surroundings it is probably more of a two-and-a-half star rating. Having the boy's sister, mum and grandmother over the weekend from Ireland, we thought we would take them somewhere with a lovely view (tick!) in a beautiful Edinburgh-y building (tick!). For just under \ u00a330 we received five cakes and five coffees. Reasonable enough, but the service is what really let us down. No one could tell us what flavours the cakes were and we were left feeling like total nuisances for asking so we just stuck to the old familiars (scones, caramel shortbread etc). After taking our seats we realised there was no jam or cream for the scones we had ordered, so the boy was sent up to retrieve some for us and was left to wait a solid five minutes while the staff member on the till stood chatting and hugging her friends. In the end we were offered the smidgiest-smidge of pouring cream and were told that there was no jam. When, we were finally brought the drinks, one of the (absolutely scalding hot!) coffees had a fly floating in it. We sent it back and received a new coffee, but again it took such a long time we were nearly finished by the time the new coffee was taken out. We received an apology by way of a free coffee card, but for somewhere like Jenners I would have expected a little bit more cop on from the staff. The deli carried beautiful products and the view was gorgeous, but it didn't impress this bunch of out-of-towners much and I can't say I'd really want to visit again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Went last night and the service was terrible. Food was pretty good, but couldn't even get our drinks filled. Had to ask the bartender for our check because the server never came back.

One of our orders didn't even come out and the manager never came by to see if he could do anything for us. The server was horrible, but the manager should have seen what was going on. The funniest part was that as we were leaving two ladies were complaining about the exact same service that they had received. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Oh Sip, why must you let me down so? I went to this place four different times, trying beer and coffee and snacks. I'll try to keep this short: Pros: -Cool aesthetic -Cool concept Cons: -Service. Consistently poor here. It's odd. There is no sense of urgency from any employee, and while I like the laid back style, at some point it shouldn't take 10 minutes for an iced coffee to be prepared, with no line ahead of you. On each and every visit, it was just a shit-show of service. On two occasions, and owner was sitting at the bar, either talking to friends, or another time a vendor. As the line grew from one customer, to four, finally the owner got up and started helping his employee, who was clearly in the weeds. Listen, I get that you have to order stuff, and take care of the business side, but if you ignore the paying customers who are right there- then soon you won't have a need for vendors. I say that with all due respect, and I hope the advice is heeded. -Products, so the iced vanilla latte (three of them) never had any vanilla flavor that I could detect. All three occasions I couldn't detect any vanilla, and while I don't need to be clubbed over the head with flavor- a hint would be nice. I had some coffee cake which was super dry, to the extent that it should be served with a red flag warning. I tried to order pizza one time, but then saw the person in back lean into a freezer to pull some component out to heat and serve. I quickly cancelled that order- if you can't do fresh- don't bother. In closing- I want this place to succeed- the Dale needs indie places, but they MUST start paying attention to detail. If they don't do that, and get a sense of urgency- this place will close, and all their hard work will be for nada. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Group of 9 guys for a bachelor party. Killed everything in site. Except for the fries. I swear it was like 3 potatoes worth of fries. Gotta watch them carb 'nah mean. Two Dozen Oysters Two orders of Bone Marrow and Oxtail Sauteed mushroom and sauteed spinach on the side I ordered a Filet Mignon - fries on the side I wanted it to be medium rare but they gave it to me medium. Should have spoken up louder. Either way I didn't want to be a punk and let a perfectly beautiful cut go to waste. I took it, ate it, and enjoyed it! Very tender and not too dry. We couldn't decide on what sauce to go with the steaks so they gave us all 3 in 3 separate pots to share. After adding their sauces I was glad that it wasn't rare. The sauces dressed a very subtle flavor to compliment the meats natural flavor without over-powering it. I also tried a bite of my friends lobster from his surf and turf combo. It tasted good but didn't stand on par to the steak. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My friend and I saw the $30 groupon for this place, and thought it was a great deal and decided to try it out! Now, I had never been to a foot spa before coming to this place, but my friend regularly goes to another and knows what they are like - I did not. Throughout college I worked at high-end salons, and was spoiled by the facilities and masseuses there; after now experiencing a ""foot spa"" I know it's a bit of a different experience. We had made appointments and arrived 20 min early; when we checked in at the desk the woman didn't say much but immediately showed us to our reserved beds. The room is partitioned off from the front desk area by a fold out divider, and behind it is about 10-12 beds, all about a foot apart from each other. It was very quiet, looked very clean, and I liked the music that was playing. The Groupon stated that we were getting a 60 min Hot Stone Relexology, but in reality it was a full body reflexology, with about 10 min of reflexology on your feet, and about 5 min of hot stone on your back. They started us off by soaking our feet in hot water - initially I thought mine was a little hot, but once my skin got used to it, it felt nice and stayed at a good temperature the entire time. While our feet soaked they began by massaging our face, neck, and shoulders. We both wish we would've known they would massage our faces, because we both had done our makeup for our plans after our massage, and quite a lot was wiped off in the process. They continued down our bodies, and I have to say they used their full body weight to work out all our kinks. I like deep massages and they definitely got in there, which is why I wasn't terribly disappointed by the experience. Towards the end I did start to hear the barking next door from the Dog Daycare, but it wasn't until I was almost finished so it didn't hinder my experience. The end was what annoyed me the most, just because of the tipping sign. Like I mentioned previously, I'm used to working in very nice salons so I thought it seemed unprofessional, but for a foot spa I suppose it's not entirely unexpected? I'm still learning how foot spas work. The girls who worked on us waited at the counter for us to tip them, and I had planned on tipping on my card, but I guess they don't like to do that - so my friend tipped them cash for both of us. Overall, it was an OK experience; my friend says she goes to Happy Foot Spa and the facility is very nice and even quieter, and the workers are very nice as well - whereas ours barely spoke/smiled at us. Overall, I would recommend not bothering with the ""hot stone"" add on, and stick with the reflexology if you do decide to purchase the Groupon! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Mmmm Cafe Vettro... You're a 3.74 in my book, but I still can't round you up. As many others have said, the service here (albeit friendly) is slow. I can't imagine what it would be like when the place is packed. Food wise, my meal was really good! I got the grilled vegetable burrito, available under the speciality sandwich section - haha. Three words: more Oaxaca cheese. This is what makes the burrito people. Ask for extra, trust. At $14, it's a wallet thinner. Since you are already spending an arm, you might as well spend a leg on their juice. The watermelon juice was very good. I would come back just for the juice. This is was the first time I bothered to read their menu/info tablet and this place is open 24 hours. Good to know at 4 am when everything else in Aria seems to be closed. ",0,0,1,0,0

 My friend and I are in Montreal for the weekend and we picked this place because it had good Yelp reviews and we could get a reservation on Opentable. When we arrived, the entire restaurant was completely empty - that should've he been our first clue. Our next clue should've been when the bread arrived...still frozen in the center. We asked our server for new bread, and he abashedly took away the offending bread and brought us a new loaf that was cold, but not frozen. Then, we ordered. I don't eat any pork, so I asked if the guinea fowl dish could be made without any lard, and the server assured me that he could do that. Shortly after, he returned and told me that the guinea fowl is actually baked with lard under the skin, so they couldn't make it totally pork-free. I changed my order to the squash dish - which my friend had also ordered, and added a half-pour of the wine they recommended to accompany the dish. The wine was delicious - and the source of the second star - with the squash dish, and while the squash was tasty, it got boring quickly. The server was not particularly attentive, which was weird since we were literally the only people eating there, and I felt kind of uncomfortable not speaking French. Then, without asking us if we wanted dessert, handed us dessert menus and wandered away for five minutes.

 Planet Dailies seemed like a good option for us when I could barely stand the thought of food - was sick with no appetite but needed to get something in my system. Thank goodness we had our 20% off coupon to use for staying at PH. My cup of vegetable soup (the only soup that wasn't a chinese soup of some sort) was $5.95 and my side salad was $7.95. Neither of them spectacular in any way shape or form and not on the menu that I could find (yes, the menu is HUGE with varying times everything is able to be ordered). So much for me trying to eat cheaply in Vegas. Oh, and no crackers for my soup either. How can a restaurant have no crackers on hand?? They did supply me with a basket of bread, which worked I guess. My husband's steak was pretty good, but nothing spectacular there either. The service wasn't slow but nothing wonderful either. So go here if you just need to eat, but if you want something to remember or enjoy the heck out of, head elsewhere. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Today I came here like usual to use the free WiFi and get a large drink. I always sit in the area by the restrooms and the TV because there is an outlet there. The TV seems to be stuck on a channel selling jewelry! I like this McDonald's I guess but it could be modernized a bit. It needs updating a lot! In the ladies room there is currently only one stall open. the other one is locked there is no handle on the door. Imagine that! I think I''ll wait awhile before I come back here because maybe by then it will be updated! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Place is huge, price is fair, has just about everything related to electronics.... on that note... CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!! Me went to look for TV few months ago, was early in the morning like 8-9am... walked past the counter of about 5 employees huddled around a desk, talking to each other having a grand ol' time! They don't even acknowledge your presence when you look all of them straight in the eye (i usually smile and say hi when I look at people... but I just smiled and kept walking since they didn't seem to care) So I was walking around look for a TV, found one, but didn't have a cart, luckily an employee with a cart walked by... ""excuse me, can I borrow that cart, I would like to get this TV"" employee #1 - ""sorry I have to use this one..."" hmmm... okay.... at this point i was pretty pissed off already at all of the people there... so I walked all the way to the front of the store... grabbed the damn cart myself... loaded the TV into the cart... and checked out... I made a complaint to the manager of the store when I got home, basically addressed the ""lack of customer service"" and how all the employees just like to chit-chat with each other and ignore customers.... all she said was okay, i will address it with that department... Piss-poor customer service.... I think I get better service at Walmart! Anyways... bottom line is... they have a ton of stuff, decent price.... they have a TON of EMPLOYEES that don't know anything about CUSTOMER SERVICE. (To be fair... other times when I do get help, there are decent employees.. but very few) ",1,0,0,0,0

 I was in the mood for cupcakes and found this place. I must admit that this place has a nice concept: build your own cupcake. You choose the cake, filling, frosting and topping. I opted for the LEMON and RED VELVET cupcake with the cream cheese frosting. I felt that the filling might be too sweet. The red velvet was a bit dry around the edges and top. The inside was a bit more moist but not by that much. It didn't have the rich cocoa taste that I was craving.. The lemon was TOO lemony. I must say it was moist but the rich lemon taste overwhelmed me. PLUS the cream cheese frosting was TOO sweet. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Hall of Frames stinks. They recently started advertising with Yelp and have repeatedly complained to Yelp about a 100% genuine and honest 3 star review I wrote about my experience with their service. So Yelp has removed it twice. Now it's rewritten and a 1-star review: 80% of the cuts on their frames are very sloppy. They try to cover it up with putty and hope you won't notice. Fortunately, the guys at this Scottsdale store are really nice and they have a no-hassle re-make policy. Unfortunately, they've jacked up their prices. A lot. Now, even with a coupon, their current prices are at about the same level as their non-discounted prices from a few months ago. Now it's no longer worth all the hassle to get custom frames from HOF. Save your money and go someplace else where they will do the job right the first time. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Complete and utter rip off! I bought tires from them, had a flat and they were going to charge my $25 to fix it! I called Discount Tire and they fixed it for free. Imagine that, a company that will fix another company's problem and for no charge! The other problem I had with this place was that they wanted to charge me $125 to read the fault codes off of my truck when your local auto parts dealer will do this for free! Everything about this place irks me and they prey on people who are not auto savvy and they have gotten away with it for so long. Please stay away from this place as they are way too expensive and will probably be the place to sell you something you do not need if they have the chance. ",1,0,0,0,0

 After reading quite a few reviews on Yelp I was convinced I wouldn't be disappointed when I read about ahi tartare, an apparently sublime lobster pot pie and the miso sea bass... But I have to say that Michael Mina just didn't live up to the hype on our recent trip to Vegas. We both did the cookbook tasting menu with the wine pairings. Hubby loved all of the dishes but I found them to be a little uninspired and a little lacking in flavor. I guess my major issue was that they seemed under-seasoned and needed a little more oomph to make them truly spectacular. Hubby thinks my palate might have been off on this occasion but I have to disagree... I did thoroughly enjoy the dessert however and the service was good. The restaurant's ambiance felt a little stiff - we were seated at the very back corner of the restaurant surrounded by folks who seemed just a tad pretentious for my liking. On this trip to Vegas we did Aureole and L'Atelier as well. Somehow the other two restaurants hit the mark a little better than this one... ",0,0,1,0,0

 to first start out by saying that I do enjoy the food at this restaurant, and what happened to me could have happened in my own kitchen, and it is the customer service and how I was handled that led to this 1 star review. I got food poising from eating the Italian wedding soup. It was the first time that I had ever eaten it, and I decided to try something new. I didn't get to eat my eggplant Parmesan which is what I normally order cause I got full off of the soup. I work on call and got called into work. I left the restaurant around 4 pm. I arrived at work around 7pm. My stomach started bothering about 30 minutes before, but I didn't feel totally bad so I went to start my shift. around 7:15 pm I started throwing up and didn't stop until the ambulance showed up at my job and gave me anti nausea meds in an IV. The next day I called the restaurant to report what happened. I call to speak with the manager after spending the night in the hospital to voice what happened and my first call was ill received by the waitress that took my first message. After I called three days later to speak with the manager. I got blown off saying that they would have the owners contact me and they never returned my call. Since I wasn't insured. I missed a night of work. The hospital and ambulance is billing me for $5000. Needless to say I will not be eating there again. But since no one that we know of reported getting sick but me. It was an isolated incident, and one I won't forget. What I was hoping for was an apology, and at least an offer to find out what happened. They didn't even ask if I were alright, and if I had any info from the hospital on what happened, and if they should be concerned. ",1,0,0,0,0

 From the moment we got there, it was a disappointment one after another. We were a group of 15, but instead of being seated right away, they were debating whether to let us in or not. Finally, after waiting outside in the cold, they decided to split us up into smaller tables. Then, to our disappointment, they gave us a reduced menu, even though we saw a couple sitting next to our menu getting the full menu. I ordered a regular dark hot chocolate. It was not bad, but my expectations were a lot higher for the price I was paying. Overall, poor service, slightly pricey, and ""meh"" quality. ",0,1,0,0,0

 While I was in the area I searched for Sushi and Blue Fin came up. However, I didn't see a sushi menu or bar. When I first walked in, I was a little disappointed, but after starring at the menu for a couple of seconds, I actually got excited. When I was in NY a couple of months ago, I went to this great Japanese curry place that was a hole in the wall and had the best Japanese curry I have ever tried. I searched for something similar when I got back to Phoenix without success. So when I was standing there I saw Japanese curry on the menu and got super excited. I ordered a bowl of that- the chicken wasn't the chicken katsu, but regular cooked chicken with carrots. It was pretty good but not what my taste buds searching for. I hate when I eat something great on vacation and cannot find it anywhere back home... Nevertheless, I hope to be back to try the teriyaki and other things on their menu. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Friendly guys who took great care of my Honda Element for me. They recommended the full battery of Honda recommend service - but did it for $200 less than the dealership. Great that's it's right next to the train station so you can get a ride to do something while they're doing the work. I appreciate the low cost of the service and part of it is in a low-cost facility - so the waiting area isn't somewhere I'd really want to spend a couple hours - that's the only thing keeping it from a 5 star rating!

 IKEA. World know company for affordable furniture. Warning: this place is a ZOO in the beginning of term (September). It's also very cunning of them the fact you have to walk throughout the whole store to get to the exit (I have tried and failed to get through the secret shortcuts but I've been told they're somewhere.). You start picking up stuff you don't need but look good and are very cheap. By the end of it, you're cart is filled with stuff you will have to give away by the end of the year anyway (stay clear of their onion choppers -they're useless items). It's great for stuff like kitchen cutlery or a bathmat but the furniture is... well you pay for what you get so don't expect too much. Also the staff can go to the two extremes: either be super helpful or don't have a clue where anything is. It's a bit out of town and if you don't have the luxury of a car you'll have to take the bus. Make sure you check the return times cause you really don't want to be stuck at that bus stop for hours.(it's the lothian bus 47 ) I have a love/hate relationship with the store. Once I came here and they were giving out free delicious Swedish cake. Cunning, very cunning. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The Herbal Pedicure? 5-star! They use new instruments each time, have plenty of soaking time plus a massage and hot towel foot wrap. The problem comes if you call to make an appointment. While they mark your appointment down in their book, your appointment isn't honored. They will take a customer who walks in 2 minutes earlier over your appointment, which leaves you waiting for a half an hour or more. This morning I called to schedule herbal pedicures simultaneously for my Mom and I for a Mother's Day treat. We arrived well before our scheduled time. And two nail technicians drew our water and asked us for our nail colors and herbal choices. But when a walk-in showed up, asking for a mani/pedi (when we only wanted herbal pedicures) the second nail tech bailed on my Mom and took the walk-in. Leaving my Mom to soak for 45 minutes while I had my pedicure done - after which the same tech then gave my Mom her pedicure. If you have time to kill and are solo, this is your place. But if you want a scheduled appointment look elsewhere. ",0,0,1,0,0

Not that crowded yet the service was extremely slow which was odd because there was almost a 1:1 ratio of staff to customers. People seated AFTER us were being served BEFORE us... and others were in the same boat as us. Saw one couple walk out after waiting too long. Crepe was good but nothing special.

 Someone really ought to study this paper and its long term negative effects on the community. Today they published a long piece on the dangers of MDMA which has a long fairly well-known track record. Their piece makes it sound as if it's the next crack cocaine, which is a huge distortion, but typical of this paper's inability to keep its deeply conservative and narrow minded attitudes restricted to its op-ed pages. Why they don't do the same hatchet job on alcohol, i.e., wait until they've accumulated a sufficient number of extreme drunken incidents and publish them as if they were the norm, I don't know. I guess too many of its writers like frequenting bars and too many of its readers know better. I'd also have to agree with Lydia's comment. On some of the most important local issues they're almost incomprehensibly muddled, though they're much better when they're ranting about some conservative cause. I've also given up responding to their nonsense on their letters page because they tend to rewrite what I submit to match their own deliberately opaque style. This paper is an unwitting best argument for retiring the old guard and replacing them with new blood and I'd be surprised if any newcomers to the area don't feel the same way in short order. They make the idea of having all legal notices posted to a website seem a no brainer. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I really wanted to like this place, but it just doesn't deliver. The decor was modern mexican and very colorful, but the food was not impressive and the prices were high for what you get, even for downtown Scottsdale. The servers were friendly, but overly attentive and borderline annoying to the point where they kept wanting to remove our plates before we were finished. I ordered the Jefe margarita for $15, which was served in a tiny glass filled with mostly ice. What little margarita I had was very smooth, but two sips later, it was all gone. My friend had the red sangria which she liked and was actually served in a regular size glass. We shared the Camarones Cevichi which was good, and the chips and guacamole which might have been the only thing worth the price we paid for it. We also shared the Chicken Tacos and the Mexico City Style Quesadilla - both looked pretty, but underwhelmed on taste. $70 dollars later, I wondered why we just didn't walk across the park to The Mission. Iron Chef Jose Garces might be a great chef, but this new restaurant falls short. ",0,1,0,0,0

 **Summary** - After not wanting to wait an hour at Tofu Hut (I probably should of), I went to Sura after almost a year of not going there. - Meats - The main things I eat are Kabli, Bulgogi, Brisket, and Tongue. - Kabli - The meat was pretty brown before cooking. The flavor was so-so, but the freshness was really low. - Bulgogi - Nothing special compared to other places. - Brisket - The brisket was not marbled well and came out tough after you cooked it. Either we got bad cuts, or the quality of the meat is just super low. - Tongue - They said they only serve tongue on the weekends. - Selection - Compared to other places, the selection has gone way down. You get a couple hot items you wouldn't get at other places (Sushi, cooked fish, variety of soups, etc), but it's not worth it. **Price** - $22.95 AYCE Weekdays - $24.95 AYCE Weekends **Recommendations** - I would not recommend this place at all. Other places are cheaper and better. Personally, I like Tofu Hut and it's only $18 for way better meat. However, the wait can get long if you go at peak times. After the abysmal experience I had at Sura, that wait is looking like the better choice. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Bad wine list. Over priced. Meat quality sub-standard. (Only bacon wrapped fillet and short ribs were good). Pork ribs were shockingly bad. Cocktails were weak and extremely expensive. Salad bar was mediocre. Some stuff very good, some below average. More impressed with Whole Foods salad bar. Service was inattentive and amateurish . Prices were high. Some servers had visible disgusting tattoos. The air conditioning sucked, it was too hot. These Brazilian / Argentinian / Rodizio / Churrascaria places are going to nose dive as the price of food keeps going up. They are lowering quality big time. These used to be high end all you can eat, now I need to get fresh plates all the time as the meat is sometimes inedible. As usual, Las Vegas high end dining and wine is generally horrible and is nothing compared to the food you can get in New York City or San Francisco Bay Area. 3 people, $450 bucks at a Churrascaria.

 I couldn't believe we actually scored a 7:30pm Saturday dinner reservation on the day of. We totally needed a splurge and it was the best place to be. I totally thought we were at the wrong place when the elevator door opened up. We walked out of the elevator and the kitchen was right there. You could see all the hustlin and bustlin of the background scene. Totally different from what I expected but kinda cool at the same time. We got seated in a booth towards the back of the round restaurant but we still got this gorgeous view of the water front of Bellagio and the strip. The tables closest to the windowline were all two-seaters so no go for us. The atmosphere is great but the food is only so-so. We had the pinky toe crab salad and seared scallop for appetizer. It was refreshing but nothing too special. My sea bass was significant overcooked...it was like chewing overcooked chicken. Since we were on a time schedule, I didn't bother to send my dish back. My friends' dishes weren't too impressive either, with the exception of the rack of lamb. The most memorable dish of the night was the souffle, which you should order at the beginning of your meal. It takes 40 minutes to make and they only make 20 for the entire room at a time. We had the Grand Manier and Caramel....omg....absolutely heavenly. I could eat that all night long. We also had the Banana Towel thingy (forgot what it was called) It wasn't too special either. I thought it would come warm but it was icy cold. It was just stacked banana slices swimming in white chocolate sauce. Again, nothing too special. Overall, I enjoyed the meal because of the company and the view. I'm not too thrill about the food since I had much better in SF. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I am usually not the guy that writes bad reviews but Uncle Bears needs to get a handle on there prices. There food is decent to OK, yet they have raised there prices over the years for some unknown reasons. Had a chicken pizza and very bland and slightly under cooked. Went back on a Sunday and place was completely dead but was with a group of 6 and this place was close to the house. There were no drink specials what so ever and pitchers of Domestic beers were $11, YES I SAID $11!! That is absolutely absurd. Most bars loose a lot of business on Sundays after Football season so give us a reason to come in. I think will just drive the few extra miles and visit Zipps. This bar needs to realize that just because you have nice flat screen TV's in front of you customers actually care about getting some type of value pricing when they go out. And if you want to sit on the patio forget sitting at the bar outside, it is like a wind storm coming down on you from the fans to keep the smoke and bugs out. If you have a dog, smoke and like to sit on a patio this bar is for you. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I felt the prices were steep considering its SUSHI. I've had far better for a far lower cost. Don't get me wrong - I won't hesistate to drop a couple of benjamins if the meal is worth it. But this was NOT worth it. I find myself hungry after less than 2 hours. It also took an inordinate amount of time for our food to arrive. Good thing our watiress was at our table less than a minute after we walked in and took our order quickly. Speaking of the waitress... while she was very friendly and attentive, she ABSOLUTELY REEKED of some sickly sweet perfurme. It turned my stomach and quite possibly ruined the meal for me. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN... if you choose foodservice as a career - which there is NOTHING wrong with - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and do NOT bathe in strong smelling perfumes and colognes. The stench greatly affects the flavor of the food your PAYING CUSTOMERS eat (yes, the ones who also tip you). Who knows - the food may have been the best food ever served to mankind...

 Pros: The grounds of this place are nice. The pool is heated. The putting green is a nice touch. The rooms are decently sized, and the cleaning staff was very friendly/hardworking. Cons: The lights by the pool at night extremely obnoxious. It is very peaceful to sit out by the pool at night, however the lights make me feel like I'm at a rave. It rotates from blue to green to red to pink! So annoying. The staff is pretty rude about it, too. When we asked about it the girl said that it added ""ambiance"" ha! If I wanted to sit by a pool and have lights flashing all around me, I would get a room in Vegas or Old Town! It got so bad that we had to leave the pool and go hang out in the room, which is a major buzzkill when it's 75 and perfect outside! This isn't the Hyatt Bar and Nightclub, it's Hyatt Place. Wake up!

 STAY AWAY. Stay far away! Unless you want to overpay, have your things stolen, deal with an inept staff and be constantly uncomfortable of the area/neighbors, do not think about renting here! We wanted to make this 3 bedroom apt our home. No, really. We went in with extremely hopeful ideas about what this place would offer us. We even thought the leasing people were cool. Boy, were we wrong. The property management was completely inconsiderate of ALL residents. Who sends the maintenance crew to blow leaves DIRECTLY under bedroom windows at 7am the day after a holiday?? And the maintenance crew? None of them spoke proper English so it was extremely difficult trying to communicate if you had an issue. With us, every single time we had a maintenance issue, they did not fix it properly. It got to the point where we just stopped bothering to call because we knew they wouldn't fix it and what a waste of time that would be. Big mistake on our part, because once we moved out, their final inspection hit us for over $500! It included outrageous extra fees and of course, the few maintenance issues we didn't bother calling them for. To make matters worse, when I attempted to set up a payment plan for the balance, they first lost my credit card information and then ""forgot"" to take payments out for almost 3 months! The whole time I thought I was paying, the money was not being taken out and I only realized it when I got a notice from Trillium that they would report my credit if I didn't begin paying! You told me I was! How incapable can one company and it's employees be?!? On top of that, I had a package delivered to the office of a single product worth $200....They didn't hold it. Or one of the leasing agents TOOK IT. When I went to retrieve it, they had nothing for me and ""couldn't"" give me any information after that. Really? Nobody saw it? You can't even ask someone that had been working if they knew anything? Nope. I was basically told I was out of luck. Also, I was NOT given proper notification to renew or cancel my lease. So I was forced to pay a prorated rate to stay longer than my lease. SEVERE disorganization and ineptitude from this company. Do not rent with ANY Trillium property. I regret the whole experience.

 As for brunch in Madison, I go to Mickie's when I am on a budget and near UW campus; travel to Original Pancake House on the west side if I am hungry and look for a family friendly relaxed setting. But when craving for good brunch food, Marigold Kitchen is my only choice. I always have mixed feeling about the humongous brunch in other places. On the one hand, it is good bang of my buck; on the other hand, it makes me over-eat and sleep in food coma afterwards. I found Marigold serve just enough food that really energizes me after my weekend brunch. I have had French toast, scrambler, and omelette in Marigold, and they are just much more delicate than other brunch places in town. The French toast is definitely among the top 3 I had in my life. So much is said about this place in previous reviews, and I do not have too much to add. If you have not been to this place, get in line and give it a try! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Checked out this place from the groupon last night. Friday night at 750 most tables were full ONE server. ordered our food, the the wings that were small and undercooked with generic sauce. got some garlic bread that we did enjoy. we had our drinks and all 3 cups were empty with some ice and I put them at the end of the table hoping the ONE server would notice, we had to call her over for refills, she said for which ones...... (I should have said only the EMPTY ones) ALL of our dishes from the garlic bread and wings sat on the table the ENTIRE time. we ordered the White pizza and realized when we got it there was no ricotta on it. I didnt want to complain I was tired of this place. The table behind us never had their pizza put in and they sat after us, and barely got their pizza as we were talking out the door. OIL everywhere on the pizza. That should not happen with white pizza. Here is the kicker, from about 820pm (FRIDAY NIGHT) they turned away 3 groups of people because ""they had NOTHING left in the kitchen"" Really? you put out a groupon not preparing for the influx of customers?!?!??! Those people will NEVER come back when a pizza place is OUT OF FOOD at 845. such an embarressment. Will not come back again ",1,0,0,0,0

 Nice roomy suire & reasonable pricing. We got a queen non-smoking suite with a mini bar. The decor of the room was renovated & quite nice, but the bathroom needed renovation to match up with the rest of the decor. I like it here cause it was off the strip but not too far away from Las Vegas Blvd....5 minutes driving that is. The resort was probably apartments back in the days then rennovated into a hotel. I didn't like the fact that I reserved a King non-smoking room, but they gave us a smoking room when we got there. The concierge wasn't really paying attention to our needs. However, the service of the house keeping was excellent. She was the one that noticed that we needed non-allergenic sheets & changed them right away. The Concierge didn't really care much. She also drove us personally in her golf cart to show us our queen non-smoking room....Big plus in my book. Good place to stay if you are on a budget. I would stay here again, but I would call ahead to make sure I get what I asked for. We did find a cockroach in our bathroom. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We found this place by accident. I wanted to try to restaurant in Circus Circus but they had a two hour wait. I know there was a steakhouse in the Riviera, so we walked across the street to check it out. My boyfriend can be a steak snob, and I thought he would hate this place. He actually enjoyed it. It's not the best steak I've had, but it wasn't terrible either. Prices were reasonable, no complaints here. The furniture was a little dated, but I wasn't expecting it to be the Ritz. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Why the F did I eat here? I think because they serve beer and it was close to the movie theatre. This place has no idea what a Margherita pizza consists of. If you cannot get even the most basic pie right, then you have no business being in business. That said, this was the Arizona Center so my expectations were definitely not high. But still, it was wasted $$$. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Poor old Dynamic Earth, I really can't understand why there are so many bad reviews about it! The first time I visited this place was on a Primary 7 class trip when it first opened. That was a while back now but I absolutely loved it, especially the earthquake, the huge ice berg and the rainforest. After all this time, it's still been a place that's always stood out in my memory and it was definitely one of my favourite trips ever. I was a little shocked then, to find so many low star reviews about it when I looked it up on Yelp. Perhaps it had changed since the last time I was there? So I decided to give it another visit to see what's gone awry. After my second visit to Our Dynamic Earth a few weeks ago, I'm still confused as to why it has so many bad reviews. It's still awesome! Okay, it was better when I was younger but it is designed for children so you can't really fault it just because you've grown up and have lost most of your imagination and childhood spirit. Rather than just strolling around at your own pace, it's designed as a tour where you are transported back to the beginning of time. You are then taken all over the world to experience all the different climates, the ice-berg is still my favourite. You even get to go on a plane, well, a 3D cinema with a flight film. In fact, I think it might be 4D as there's even snow, wind and heat too.Very cool. Definitely one for the kids, but if you still have any imagination at all then this place is great and even if you're too grown up for the tour, the planetarium at the end is beautiful so there's something for everyone to enjoy.

 I had never been to Nori before and am not a sushi expert by any means, but I had just about the best meal and experience there ever! Make sure you request Lindsey as your server. She's very fun and knowledgable. She helped my table and I pick out the best rolls and paired them with the best and most appropriate sake. I will definitely be coming here again... And again...! Never knew that a sushi joint at a mall could taste so great and leave such a lasting impression. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Arrived at 8:30 for Sat dinner and were given some great suggestions. There was a large family and like 2 other couples at the same time, and all were Indian so we thought it might be good after all. We started with Chili Pakoras, which are fried jalapenos, but spicy ones! The hostess even came out and wanted to make sure we understood what we ordered. Hubby had Lamb Curry, which was in a red spicy sauce-not intense, not bad considering I'm not a lamb eater. I had the Spinach Chicken which was very tasty and the spinach was just cooked right. We made one of our meals into a Thali, which is a big tray with several little samplings and we also had some bread that accompanies the main dish. We had a great time trying out this new food and thinking about recommending and going back. Total was about $30+, not bad for dinner for two on date night. Next time I'd like to try the mango dessert and a drink. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Went there just tonight, so it was busy as expected of a Saturday evening. It was my friend's birthday, and we had a big group. I was surprised with the restaurant interior, I guess it just doesn't suit the name Beertown. The interior is like what you'd expect from Wildcraft and The Bauer Kitchen. As for service, they were quick with cleaning up unused plates on the table but it's sort of hard to get their attention (maybe because it's a Saturday evening). Also, it was very, very loud tonight. My boyfriend and I shared the pork belly poutine and the summer dinner: a tomato bisque, shrimp penne, and strawberry crisp dessert. We also got the Sweet & Light Paddle. In the end, it was filling but also overpriced for the quality of the food; it came down to a total of $60 before tax. I'd say my favourite was definitely the pork belly poutine. It was a pretty big portion for its price, and it tasted pretty good! Other than that, I don't think I would return. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I like the review of the whacked waiter... i think he may be still at work at 'Cantina Laredo' cuz i think he served us....... Called ahead after a Cardinals game to make sure there was room enough for our party of 10- "" No problem "" we were told , come on down. arrived 9:00 ish on a beautiful 80F evening in Scottsdale -stepped across a half empty patio into the spacious Cantina - chilled to an ungodly 60F- Note to the great state of Arizona : (the reason that y'all are booming and experiencing sustained in-migration is because people are like lizards--- ( in more ways than one)---they like the sun , they like the heat ... they flee from northern climes to get away from the chill - Don't AC your premises such that it reminds us of Duluth in winter.... we just escaped Duluth in winter and fled south to thaw ) . we asked for a spot on the patio and our man immediately declined stating that "" he had already set a table for us inside""- upon my wife's insistence that he reevaluatethe patio he disappeared for a moment or two and then reappeared - affirming that the half empty patio was indeed full. this puzzled my wife who then surmised that : A) he wanted our large party in his section -not the patio B) there would likely be a built in minimum gratuity on the final bill ( there was) after taking our drink order ,(competently), he returned with salsa and chips. The salsa he described as being of two types ""hot "" or ""regular""- there were indeed two temperatures -but they appeared to be seperated thermally rather than chemically -?? the same salsa one served at room temperature , one served chilled...??? when asked about the best dishes for people who wanted a little kick to their food he replied: "" I wouldn't really know , I don't like spicy food"" ????????????????? Dude , can you not at least fake something.... it is after all a Mexican restaurant. If people want spice they go Mexican - if they want bland they seek out a Saskatchewan restaurant - non? The meal was salvaged - ( not saved), by a compatriot of our man who hailed from Durango- he spoke knowledgeably about the menu , filled our empty margarita glasses and retreated into the kitchen to assemble , on our behalf , a pepper mole sauce that was truely outstanding. The food was uninspired -( there was a Baja Grill of some sort across the parking lot and we wondered if they shared a kitchen...) , the service was poor ( excepting our hombre from Mejico ), and the casa freakishly cold-- Two stars tops over all but boosted up to three by our amigo from Victoria de Durango ",0,0,1,0,0

 Looking for a casual lunch spot with moderate prices and a large selection of sandwiches, salads, drinks, etc...? Look no further than Sacks. Not only do they deliver on the attributes I mention above, but they also deliver literally (with a minimum $25 order and they charge just a gratuity that goes to the driver). I used to frequent this Sacks when they were located at 48th St and Indian School, and just recently remembered that they relocated just down the street at 42nd and Indian School. I've been several times in the last few weeks and have been a satisfied customer for sure. I usually go for their Cobb Salad (no onion and add avocado) with balsamic dressing. I love that Sacks is fine with modifications to their menu items! I'm also a fan of their egg salad, the Sacks Symphony Sandwich, and the Sacks Impressionist Sandwich. I love that they have Snapple drinks and lots of iced tea fountain options as well as Sun Chips! Their cookies (they come with every meal) are another nice perk if you're not watching your sweet intake! I must say, I do miss the crackers that they used to serve with the salads awhile back. Perhaps they will bring those back sometime soon?! I have yet to take advantage of the delivery service mentioned above, but I do plan on using that in the future when I can't get away to pick up or eat there. Glad to have yet another reliable lunch option in the hood! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I love chipotle but this one kind of sucks. Sure I came in late, but an hour before closing everything was shut down. They had no chips or guac and the remaining rice was hard and undercooked. Maybe it's fine in the middle of the day but everyone working here was more concerned with closing procedures than dealing with the lengthening line. Again I would have understood if I came in 3 mins before closing, but I was handed my burrito in a to go bag and the hint was definitely to get out! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Food is exquisitely seasoned and they use good quality, fresh ingredients. I like it very spicy but too much spice can kill the real flavor. We ordered two entrees and an appetizer. The food seemed a bit small at first, but in reality, it was the perfect portion size for two people. Any more and I would have overeaten and felt as such. And don't we Americans have a distorted sense of portion, anyway? Lots of Chinese people in this restaurant dining with their families means this place MUST be good! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I stayed at the HR June 15 and 16, 2014 and unfortunately it was a regrettable experience. The hotel has become a bit shaggy and worn with a commensurate lack of concern for customer service. i checked-in at 2:00 pm (their regular check-in time begins at 3:00 so granted, i was early) and was told my room wasn't available and in the very same breath the desk clerk asked if i wanted to upgrade to a corner room for another $40 per night extra. I figured ""what the heck"" and agreed to the increase/upgrade. Bad move. The upgrade was anything but. I did get a ""view""but it was of an empty lot housing a few dozen bedraggled palm trees and and unvisited parking lot reserved for maintenance vehicles/staff. Next, the room was not fully serviced and there were no cups, amenities, etc. I had to ask the cleaning staff three times for a cup and three times i received nothing. I also waited until the next day at 6:30p for the room to be serviced for the first time since I had checked in. In any event, this place is truly between a ""rock and a hard spot""(chiasmus intended) and i would advise fellow yelpers to avoid it and opt for the strip hotels for a first rate experience.

 We found this place one day when we were walking along the strip and I was not feeling well. I have hypoglycemia and had not eaten in several hours. We had been wondering around the Hawian Marketplace and I was feeling so bad I was not sure what I was doing. We went in the building which sadly is deserted on the first floor and one of the employees directed us upstairs. He could see I was ill and got the manager who immediately got us a table. Once I had been seated and started getting back to normal we ordered. I had the butter chicken which was amazing and my BF had the curried Goat. Our waiter was shocked he asked for the goat and had to make sure they still had some but came back smiling and letting us know it was still available. He said it was fantastic. Our waiter was attentive and kept a positive attitude even though and indian couple behind us ordered several things and kept sending them back unhappy he never lost patience with anyone. It was a great meal and we would go back. At the time one of the half price outlets had coupons to reduce the price. We also ate here on Christmas day for the lunch buffet and while it was good none of the entrees were marked and even a few indian customers questioned what the dishes were. I was not nearly as impressed with the buffet. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I stopped by here on my way home from whole foods market. They had just paved there parking lot which can only fit 3 max cars at a time.

 The best part of this meal was this small cup of pea soup that our waiter gave us compliments of the chef. It came in a little mug and was served chilled. It was lights out. The rest of the food was average to me. I ordered the blue cheese encrusted kobe beef while my friend got the flat iron kobe. For an app we split the ""Maryland"" style crab cakes. The crab cakes were nothing special and were not even close to being like a Maryland crab cake. I felt that my steak was pretty tough for such an expensive cut. It was thick and juicy though and filled with flavor. The flat iron was cut like a london broil and had a very good reduced balsamic sauce. Wait service was good as well. Great selection of breads.

 While my most recent dining experience at Lavo was not as stunning as before, I and my party enjoyed an excellent meal. As an opener, Baked Clams Oreganato yielded very garlicky clams but they were accompanied in their shells by a very tasty sauce. And, the buttery Garlic Bread that came with the meal was so good that I sought and received another loaf--and, after its arrival, polished off most of it myself. A Caesar Salad was an excellent Caesar, with unusual Pesto Croutons and requested anchovies. This time for my chosen entree I went more rustic, and, opting for some fine peasant cuisine, ordered Spaghetti with Kobe Meatballs, which featured large meaty balls, a superior thick tomato-based sauce, and fresh Ricotta and Parmigiano Cheese. The dish was quite satisfying, as was a side of Roasted Rosemary Potatoes. Diane also enjoyed her well-pounded Veal Parm. Service was excellent and attentive. The only discordant note was really the too loud driving music played nonstop by the DJ. It did not harmonize well with digesting food or trying to carry on a conversation with one's spouse and friends across a dining table. Loss of a half-step, and so a half-star, this outing.

The Onion Rings was a total rip off, if I were to pay 8$ for merely 6 onion rings, they better be plated in gold, soaked with unicorn blood and deep-fried in Lambda olive oil. It tasted nice, but still, onion rings aren't haute cuisine. The Smoke Meat Poutine was really tasty, the gravy was just on point and generously poured over their amazing fries. The Sandwich Euro lacked lots of seasoning, and the mayo was not evenly spread. We waited for almost 15 minutes until our orders were taken, but it happens during a crowded evening. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I was really surprise at how fun and cool this place turned out to be. Spacious and open, you don't feel like you're tripping over the little peanuts.There's plenty to keep the kids entertained from the interactive games to the mesmerizing moving floor. With a very well stocked bar, there's pool and bowling to keep you from going stir crazy. Food was surprisingly good and moderately priced. The bowling was definitely my fave part because of the animated cartoons in between each player. Pure utter entertainment. Love seeing your personalized selfies become animated clips of ""cheer squad.""

 Parking is crap. I had to pay for parking. I couldn't find a spot initially because the lot was so full. I sharked for awhile before finally finding a spot. I can't believe I had to pay for this. It isn't like the property is worth so much that they lose money on the lot. Whatever. Service fee at the box office. What up with that? That is ""Bait and Switch"" because there is no cheaper way to purchase the tickets. They advertise one price and then you learn there is an unavoidable fee. Bait and switch. The security line is a joke. You get the full pat down. You need to empty your pockets too. I felt like I was entering some jail at a 3rd world country. I hate being treated like an animal. They scan your ids and retain the photos. Feel violated much? Alcohol is expensive. The AC must be broken because it was hot like a mutha. There are virtually no seats in the entire venue; including the bar and the outside area. The only place to sit is a low brick wall outside, in the heat with the smokers. The theater has no seating as well. The floor is concrete so that is super comfortable for any show over 30 minutes. Nothing like standing for hours on a slanted concrete slab. The security are jerks. They seem to forget we are the customers paying for their part-time salaries. The Marquee is one of the few businesses that don't want to cater to the customer. I have skipped out on several shows hosted by the Marquee. My decision was strictly based on the venue. I hate that place and hate giving them my hard earned dollar. ",1,0,0,0,0

 At the price point that Rao's commands, the food should be much better. We both had pork chops. One was dark and juicy, the other was white and bone dry. The bread was just ok, but the olive oil was bitter. The roasted beet salad was very good. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Naturally, the first thing I do when trying out a new place is check out the reviews on Yelp and when I checked it out for Akahana, many people mentioned how bad the service was. I wanted to be the one who proved them wrong, the one to show everyone that Akahana would be my new, wonderful go to spot with terrific service but I'm sad to report I'm not that person. I don't know if it was because they are newer and are drawing in quite a crowd on Thursday nights and the servers are overwhelmed but the service was almost non existent. We practically had to flag down our waitress to give her our order, get refills, etc. and I contemplated throwing a chopstick at our server to get her attention but with my luck, that would've either a) turn into a lawsuit or b) get violently ill from sushi gone wrong. On the flip side, $17 for two rolls, a salad and a beer is A-Ok in my book. The sushi? Holy wonderful, fresh, yummyness batman! I was surprised by how fresh it was and how much flavor it had packed in the rolls. Some mentioned that the rolls on BOGO nights (Tuesdays and Thursdays) were smaller but I felt they were appropriate sized pieces for what they are charging (I can't remember the names exactly but got the Furious Dragon and Sweet Romeo roll). The downside about BOGO nights is that there isn't any vegetarian options on the BOGO menu and it says no substitutions on the menu. The vibe was good-very vibrant with orange walls, moderate volume music and packed. They have a moderate sized bar area complete with the regular stuff you would expect-ESPN, Japanese beers and specials galore. I will be back to check out Akahana.....but only when I have nothing planned afterwards so I won't mind waiting so long for my sush. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Affordable. Centrally Located. Lots of Options. If you are a Harrah's property loyalist like me, you know that Bally's is definitely not on the high end of the company's charts, that is not to say, however, that Bally's is a dump. I had a quick weekend in town last month and wanted to be central to all of the properties, and figured I would give Bally's a try. Once I sprinted out of the airport Friday night in hopes of beating the cab-line rush, I had little wait and began the short ride to the strip. While I am not usually a huge fan of arriving late at night, it was nice to have no one in front of me at the check-in desk. The whole process of checking-in took maybe 5 minutes, and I was on my way to luck! The room was an upgraded room in the south tower, so a bit bigger than the standard, but nothing crazy impressive. My stay was problem-free, with my only complaint being the cost of wifi ($13.95 per day), but that is not a Bally's specific issue... The food on property was good, especially with Paris being connected. I strongly recommend getting the Buffet of Buffets if you go, it is 7 buffets across Harrah's properties for $44.. for 24 hours of unlimited access. My belt is reminding me that I definitely got my money's worth right now, actually... I would stay again if I was looking in a cheaper price range. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I like Wendy's and I think their food is generally better than the bunch, but this location is BAAAAD. Don't get me wrong, the employees are friendly and try to be helpful, but there are two large problems with this location; the employees lack training and 50% of my orders come out wrong. Wendy's mails coupons to my home, and often this location hands out coupons with orders, but EVERY time I went to use a coupon at this location, they have no idea how to enter it. They almost always say their don't have the button on their cash register for it, but I have to believe its poor training, or a complete lack of any training. Second, at least 50% of the time, the order I get is wrong. At the drivethru I'm almost always missing at least one item which I don't discover until I get home. In the store, items are wrong as well. Again, lack of any training seems to be the problem, and a high employee turnover at this location also seems like a problem. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Walking into this place is like shopping at an international market. There are some very unique items and its fun to wonder around and check out items like chop sticks set, saimin bowls, and bangles from India. I like coming in when they have put out their Christmas stuff. The ornaments are very different and are so cute. They have every kind of them you good think of and some one of kind items. I came last year for my secret Santa gift and they loved it! They have a small amount of food items, tea and coffees from around the world. And they usually have some samples waiting to be tried. If you are looking for some unique decorative items for the house, some quaint English biscuit, or a nice bar stool, this is your place. Be sure to look into their membership card, for general savings and coupons! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Meh, it's a standard neighborhood mall. About the only thing ""special"" is that there is a Dillards here. Kohl's and Macy's are all over the place but only 3 Dillard's left in Las Vegas. And even Dillard's is pretty mundane unless they are having one of their extra-%-off-clearance events. So Meadows Mall isn't a ""destination"" but it is quite functional as a neighborhood mall. Even though I'm ""only"" a tourist, I've had my eyeglass prescription updated, upgraded my cell phone, and eaten decent food court food here. ",0,0,1,0,0

 FINALLY got a call from the manager of the office after emailing twice. I received 3 months of free contacts, which is great since my lenses are really expensive. The manager was really nice and wouldn't stop apologizing for the awful experience. However, when I went in to pick up the contacts, all of the girls at the desk were rude. There was no ""How are you"" or any of that. I even witnessed one of them say ""just sit down over there and I'll get to you in a minute"". Only reason for the 3 is because the manager was so nice once I got her on the phone. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have worked in a customer service job for four years and this was an absolute terrible customer service experience. First off, don't come here within the last 40 minutes of them being opened. Everything felt rushed. The lady at the register told myself and other customers ""they were out of meat and it would take at least 20 minutes to cook"" in a persuasive way to try and get everyone out. When I ordered a combo, she asked if I still wanted the egg rolls (that come with the combo) as that would delay my food even longer if I still wanted them. All the nozzles were off the soda machines so getting a drink was an even more difficult process. They also decided to lock up and turn off their open sign 25 minutes prior to close to keep other customers out. The only reason I give this location two stars is because the food is still better than eating at McDonald's. Terrible customer service. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I certainly haven't been to all the venues in town, but this is the worst one yet. First, let me say that the act we saw (Lez Zeppelin) was amazing. They weren't the problem. The problem is the layout of this place. About 1/3 of the entire downstairs area is blocked by a giant staircase. So, of course, head upstairs. Except that you can't see anything unless you're in the first row...and even then the owners decided to put up drapes which obscure more of the view. Finally, there are three projected screens on one side. Two of them (the smaller ones) project a live feed of the show, but the quality of the video is terrible. And one of them (the largest and the one in the middle) is a constantly looped ad for, you guessed it, Alter Bar. Why have the screen there if you're not going to show the act? Overall, I had a great time with my friends, but that was entirely despite the venue. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is a cute little neighborhood bar. They have a nice collection of beer. They will also serve you some food if you're hungry. The best part of this bar is the Terrasse in the back. It's really cute and it makes you want to stick around all night. And the worst part of this bar is the service. Unfortunately you can spend a lot of time looking around for a waitress, waving your hands, and wondering why are they not looking over this way. If it wasn't for the service I would give it 4 stars. Maybe you'll have better luck;) ",0,0,1,0,0

 Good things first: -Food was DELICIOUS! We loved everything we ate. Tempura green beans were super yum, I could have eaten another entire platter of them especially with that cream cheese pepper jam dipping sauce. I had the short rib sliders and they were delectable with a nice sweetness to the meat. My husband, a vegetarian, had the fried green tomato sandwich and loved it. -Service was terrific! Our server was attentive, funny, and helpful. I was never without water. Great experience there. -Prices were very reasonable for the quality of food. And our portion sizes were great. I left STUFFED. Now a few bad, which is the only reason I've taken off one star: -The seating is terribly uncomfortable. We were seated at the communal table with high wooden chairs. The seats of the chairs just aren't quite long enough so they cut me off at mid-thigh, painfully. Also, there is a poured concrete ""step"" around the table. I'm thinking this was for you to rest your feet on, but it's not high enough for my legs to reach, so was pointless. I still had to rest my legs on my chair. I am 5'7"". Also, the concrete slab makes it impossible to pull your chair all the way in to the table, making me just a bit too far away to sit and eat without having to lean in. Awkward. -I ordered a ""microbrew"" soda, they have a few on the menu, and I was excited to try Dr. Better. It was served to me with the bottle and a glass of ice. Great, except the bottle was warm. Not like only-recently-placed-in-the-refrigerator-to-chill warm. It was HOT like it was sitting in a non-air conditioned storeroom. My friend's soda was also served to him in a warm bottle. It was unfortunate because the flavor of the soda was diluted by pouring it warm over the ice. Why would they not serve it chilled? Do they not have a room for a soda refrigerator? It struck me as strange. And irritating. -It was really loud in there. The music wasn't loud, but all those folks talking in such a small space made for a noisy noisy dining experience. It was hard to have a conversation between just me, my husband, and our friend. Oh well. Overall though, we will definitely be back because the food and service was great and there are other things I want to try. I will however try to grin and bear it while sitting on their uncomfortable seats, not bother ordering a soda again, and will forgo conversation and just focus on eating! ",0,0,0,1,0

 We were excited to have our first experience in NoDa - Brought the In-Laws from California - And were excited to try some of the multitude of beer options at Revolution and see the style of NoDa. But honestly and I work in the service industry, so I hate giving poor reviews, but we were underwhelmed. We went in through the front doors and were just completely overtaken by a stench in the place - Combination burnt pizza and spilled beer. I mean I guess if you know what you're expecting, take this with a grain of salt - But really it just turned us off to ordering any food, and we sat outside. We ordered a couple flights and a pitcher - And those were fantastic, beer was good server was nice. But after just walking into the place we didn't even want to try the food - It looked dirty and smelled worse. ",0,0,1,0,0

 So my coworker was really promoting this place to me, and I felt like Chinese food so our decision was made.......Horrible mistake! Number One: Disgusting bland food. Every single (limited selection) dish sucked! The orange chicken tasted like old microwaved from freezer over sauced cardboard. The onion rings were crap. The egg rolls, crap. The chow mein noodles which I thought were supposed to look brown, were these pale watery strans of crap. The rice, which was clearly not white rice, was bland. The desserts sucked as well. Also, the presentation of the food looked very sloppy. Number Two: Horrible enviornment. Ugly pink walls with horrible dollar store decorations. The booth seats were WAAAAYYY to close to the tables which made for an uncomfortable sitting experience. The sneeze guards were dirty. Weird smell. And stupid layout, with a couple of booths too close to the employee personal area and some too close to the (again small) buffet line. Number Three: After this review, I am calling the health services on this disgustng place. A couple of times I noticed an employee scratching their nose, and then continuing with their work. Then I was forcing down my food when my coworker spots a moving insect on the wall next to us. It was a BABY COCKROACH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Screw this place. I will never ever go back here. And if this place isnt shut down, I hope nobody else does either. On the plus side, its only $6.00. But still not worth it. If I could, I would give this place negetive 1000000000000000000000 stars.

 WHAT??? decided to try this place after all the good reviews online. waited 3rd in line for drive thru 50 minutes! for real...50 mins! 2:15 pm sunday till 3:05pm! got pastrami burger. the pastrami was...pastrami...nothing special about it at all. no to-die-for seasoning or flavor..just pastrami. the meat patty was horrible. i despise fast food joints, especially mcdonalds, however mcdonalds cheap burger has more flavor and texture than what was on this one that is WAY overpriced. wont' be back..not sure what all the fuss is about this place...get the #9 at TOGOs in California, or go to Mirage and get the pastrami there at Carnagie Deli..and the wait will be 8 mins at most, table side. fine dining this place is not. worth a 50 minute wait? ...OMG....who are these people raving about this place on yelp..as second to none,etc.? get real. rather spend $100 at a nice restaurant on food, and get a great bottle of wine to go with it, than $10 waiting for 50 minutes in the vegas heat for a horrible sandwich, with no flavor and nothing special or unique about it at all. all these losers on yelp have no clue about cuisine and reviewing like a pro. and no one needs to see their pics either!

 THANK YOU! Finally WONDERFUL Italian food ... Yumm & double yumm!!! That was last year. And it was true. Wonderful warm welcoming feeling, wonderful food, wonderful service. And very understanding and cooperative toward my wife, who is blind. Even to the point of standing on a chair to direct and adjust the available light to best serve my wife. All in all quite impressive and worth the 5 * I gave it. But that was last year. I don't know what happened, maybe they were sold, but this year was entirely different. No warm vibe, no welcoming feeling, totally empty, music and tv blaring, some staff person sitting at the bar texting, waiter says: this is the best lit table (it was pretty dark), I request the table were the guy adjusted the lights, he say I can't do that and it never happened, no one would do such a thing.

 Went here for the first time to meet a friend. It was Sunday (Super Bowl) afternoon so the place was understandably empty. We were greeted by four (4) staff members and was seated right away. We were the only customers. Wasn't planning on pigging out because I wanted to catch the game. We ordered our drinks, Thai Iced Coffee and diet Coke, as we sat down. We ordered pretty much the same dish, my friend ordered Beef Pad See Ewe, and I ordered Beef Rad Na (basically, pad see ewe soup). The drinks came quite quickly. The drinks were in cocktail glasses and personally i thought they were a tad small for one serving. The coffee was MEH! Didnt feel the caffeine kick at all. The food came and of course they looked identical because the only difference was that the other was dry, and the other, a soup-like dish. The servings were MEH!. Normally, a dish could be easily shared by two, but their servings weren't even enough for one adult. I think they cooked both our orders the same time, in the same pot and just divided in half and poured sauce on the other. My friend wasn't hungry but he finished and cleaned his plate (that tells you how small the serving was). Taste, flavoring, spice, heat and seasoning were a-OK. I had much better, and a lot more, Thai food in other Thai restaurants. Service was OK. I was just wondering how come we were never served water, or was there a need to ask for it? I don't think I'll be coming back here considering the many choices I have around the valley. ",0,1,0,0,0

 If you're in the mood for a great italian meal and maybe a glass of wine or two, you cannot go wrong with Oregano's. Be prepared to wait for a table (it's a great restaurant!) but once you're inside, you'll be pleasantly surprised. I've been to this location several times. Small and with limited parking (in the back), it can be a little crowded. But the atmosphere is wonderful! Fairly quiet but with a great energy, the vibe here is unlike any other. The food is absolutely on point. I most recently ordered a pizza and we were not able to finish it between two people.

 My husband and I stopped in for a Sat. lunch. Only 1 waitress was available. She had the outside area plus inside. We ordered sandwiches and when they came, we opened the napkin to get the silverware and were shocked. The silverware was disgustingly dirty with film and stains. I reached to another empty table and tried that silverware, same thing. We finally waited 10 minutes (while our sandwiches got cold) till we could get our waitress. We asked for the manager. He came to the table and when I showed him the silverware, he said he'd make sure this problem was taken care of. No apology. The waitress came back and handled us two sets of wrapped silverware. I said, ""Are these clean?"" She assured us that they were clean. I opened the wrapped silverware and they were just as dirty. Now almost 20 minutes have gone by and we still don't have clean silverware. The waitress finally came back with partially cleaned silverware. We finished our lunch and then sat almost 10 minutes waiting for our check.

 oh man... the wife and i have been dying to try this place since it opened on the recommendation of a good foodie friend of ours, and it did not disappoint one tiny bit. first off is the setting, in a historic house in heritage square. you get a welcome feeling because of the layout even though it's definitely not styled like an old home inside. the hostess/food runner was pleasant, and nobuo himself brought a couple of dishes to our table and came by to make sure we had everything we needed. the reason we came here was the okonomiyaki, and it deserves it's reputation. i've had this dish before at other restaurants but it was never this good! we also tried the ebi salad and the short rib steamed buns, and the barley tea. everything went well together, was delicious, and probably ranks as one of the best lunches we've ever had. we will definitely be back, and with friends in tow... we can't wait to try out the dinner menu!

 The food was good; however I believe restaurants in Las Vegas have forgotten the meaning of customer service. We went in around 10:30am on a weekday because this place gets really busy during peak breakfast and lunch hours. We got our bill and put 2 cards for them to split the check. They ran both cards and included a note about check splitting, i.e. ""Dear check splitters, when we are slammed we will only take one card per table."" I found this note after-the-fact quite rude, especially since they were not slammed. I see that it's a small place so a quick turnover is necessary. Still, this was an absolutely rude way to enforce a no check splitting policy. The policy was posted nowhere prior to paying our bill, nor was the note there when they brought us the check. I find this to be a ridiculous policy as far as customer service goes, but what was the point of telling us AFTER they split the check. Was this meant to ""shame"" us? If they are trying to let us know for ""next"" time, no worries with the multitude of restaurants available in Las Vegas, neither one of us will ever go back, that was so rude. ",0,1,0,0,0

 mmm-mmm-mmm, I'm ambivalent about this bar... On the plus side, we ate here after escaping a shady time-share sales pitch down the hall. We were so happy about getting out of there with our wallets intact that we were giddy to eat here. The bartender said that most of his customers came in straight from the timeshare pitch to get hammered and complain about being suckers. On the minus side, the food is for suckers. It's overpriced, although a Total Rewards card knocks off a dollar or two, and it's not that good. On the plus side, the mason-jar sized drink got my wife drunk enough to be very entertaining, but not so drunk that she hit the point of diminishing returns. So the bartender gets props for hitting the sweet spot. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I was here yesterday for Porter Robinson's set at the Dayclub, I haven't been to the nightclub. Overall a good venue, but from what I've seen in Vegas this pool area is rather small. Unless you purchase a daybed or cabana you're probably better off checking out a different pool party. I liked the stage setup; I was able to walk right up to the side of the DJ booth without too much trouble even though it was pretty packed. If you're a fan of the DJ it's cool but otherwise I'd check out some other pool parties with more square footage to offer. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Of couse, Cosmo had to bring the uber trendy, celeb, LA hotspot restaurant to Vegas...FINALLY, if you ask me. Came for a friends birthday with a party of....hmmm, maybe 25...and got the private room =) Which was really cool because we were told Oprah and JayZ ate in that room. Hip hop music was blasting; the walls were padded and sound proof; and there was a flat screen in there. Really interesting ambiance! Anyways, our waiter was super funny and good-looking. (Wouldn't expect anything else from STK/Cosmo). Service was great because he was fun, informative, and even took a couple shots with us...of which he paid for! I'm not sure u can drink on the job nor why he paid for them but, we'll take it. Their bread was delicious!!!!! The bread's dipping sauce was amazing...looked like pesto and olive oil... Their wine list was second to none. They had my favorite tequila! And their oysters were pretty fresh. I had lamb. DUH! And it was ""eh.."" I mean, maybe I should've had s-t-e-a-k at a steak house but, alas, I've had better. And ordered their ""famous"" mac and cheese as my side....and I was really disappointed =( It was salty. Sadly, I tried friends' mac and cheese and theirs were really good. I should've gotten the mushrooms. Their birthday cake is...gourmet, of course! I think they order the cake from Cosmo's bakery. All in all, I'm glad I ate there..just to say I've eaten there. But, it's not someplace I want to eat at any time soon. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I do not appreciate rude employees and bad customer service, but at least I get to let it out on YELP!! I have been ""told off"" for bringing in international packages. Twice now, the cashier has yelled out to everyone in the line waiting behind me that because I brought in some packages that need to be sent off overseas, they all have to wait longer! Wait, what? I thought I was paying you for a service. Most of the employees here are extremely slow at entering information. Twice in the middle of a transaction their computers have shut down....and they had to re-enter EVERYTHING all over again. Oh and once their Credit Card machine failed at the end of a transaction...all they could do was ask me to pay cash for it. Yes, the air conditioning system seemed not to be working a few times during the summer, which makes standing in line for 30-40 minutes unbearable. I will say it is convenient because it is right off the 101 and Cave Creek. They do have a couple really nice and competent employees too, but that is about it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 ""Hey Giambi, I've got money on you this year!"" What kind of place kicks out 10 grown men from dinner that they've already ordered for being too obnoxious? I mean we're hotel guests for Christ's sake. Isn't it normal for a group of people to each have well over 10 drinks before the sun sets and then want to go have a classy dinner at a nice hotel? Well apparently it's not ok to be piss drunk, cat call at women and stand up and yell stuff at the Oakland A's as they exited their team dinner, at least not at the Valley Ho. In all seriousness we're lucky they didn't kick us out of the entire hotel. I'll give Valley Ho 2 stars for that and nothing more. Majorly overpriced for Scottsdale, the rooms seem futuristic in a cheap way and nothing stood out to me as cool. The pool area is nice but what pool isn't nice in mid-March when you're coming from 50 degree weather? It's obvious this place used to be a Best Western or some other cheap chain, you can dress a place up but the layout screams 2 star resort. The best part of the stay was seeing the look on the hostess' face when we all showed up at the restaurant for breakfast after being kicked out the night before. Get those bloody mary's ready bitch. If they cut your group off of drinking while dining at the Valley Ho I'd suggest not bypassing the waitress and ordering straight from the bar, it'll get you 86'd faster than trying to dry hump your date in an 8th grade dance.

 Okay I will start by saying that the food was not at all what I was expecting when I made reservations at this restaurant. Upon arrival, the decor was very nice and I thought I was in for a treat. Well I was wrong. We started with a few cocktails, which were good. We ordered some starters, The Edamame sampler (was good and the garlic wasabe edamame was an interesting twist on a favorite), Hot and Sour Soup with Shrimp toast (my soup was pitch black, and the shrimp toast was burnt on the outside but mushy on the inside?), and Vegetable Dumplings (were overcooked, the skins were mushy). For entrees we ordered the Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken (which was basically like Sweet and Sour Chicken at most chinese fast food restaurants, but not fried), Eggplant, and Noodles. After seeing the food I think the prices are absolutely ridiculous for what they provide. The food is not flavorful in any way and I definently think that Tao needs to revamp their dishes (all of them were unimpressive) At the end of our meal we did get a dessert which was a sampler of many of their desserts. I have to say this was definently the highlight of a disappointing meal. They had a sparkler on the dessert platter when they brought it out and the thing that caught my attention was the GIGANTIC fortune cookie (which has white chocolage mousse on one side and chocolate mouse on the other side). They also had some sort of chocolate cake with a melted chocolate inside, and a fried dessert eggroll. Overall I would recommend for the money you can find much better places to eat in Las Vegas.

 Got kicked out of Fridays First Row! What a bunch of pieces of craps! We only had 2 rounds of drinks there, we weren't being loud or obnoxious, the place was practically empty and the manager couldn't give us a satisfactory answer as to why we were being dismissed. The only thing he kept repeating was ""I have to back his bartenders."" WTF?! It's cool to have a manager to back you up like this but c'mon guy! YOU didn't even notice anything out of the ordinary from our group, you were right there!!! WE WERE NOT DRUNK OR LOUD! Even thought that was our last drink there, it still pissed us off. Needless to say, they didn't deserve a tip and we took our business to a place that appreciates having a good group of day drinkers at their empty establishments on a slow Saturday afternoon. In downtown Phoenix, it wasn't hard to find the next spot... *** Da Bafroom: Sorry folks, we were not there long enough to make this visit.

 I usually go to this store to get all my work shirts done and have no Problem but I went this year and the owner Chris helped me out. I asked him to make the logo all red and when I went to pick up my shirt he had made the majority white with hardly any red. When I confronted him about it he said that he didn't know and didn't hear me. Obviously I know that once the printing is done its irreversible but I asked him if I brought him another shirt if he could do it in the right color or at least give me a discount and he said there was absolutely nothing he could do about it. So I guess I'm out of luck because he wasn't paying attention and didn't hear me and now I'm not only out of the money I paid him but the money I spent on the shirt. For being the owner I personally think he handled the situation very poorly. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My husband and I have been here numerous times. The location is decent - I like that the Biltmore/Union shopping center is right across the street. Plus, Fuego Tacos is down below and tasty. However, there isn't much else in this plaza. A few places to eat, but whenever we visit, everything seems dead. While the parking lot can get pretty full, there's never anyone walking around. It's like a ghost town! My husband and I used to come here more frequently, but when they closed to upgrade to the dining experience, we realized the Desert Ridge location is much closer to us. (We found out they were renovating the hard way. We stopped by one afternoon to find the AMC closed and none of the restaurants were open yet. Again, total ghost town!) Needless to say, we haven't tried the new dining experience but it's on our list. Once we try the new dining experience, look for an updated review! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've been torn about my review of Giada for a couple weeks now. There were some HUGE highs and some MAJOR lows of my experience there. I will appologize for the length of this review, in advance. If someone from management reads this, I will be glad to discuss further. I was traveling for work and having dinner by myself. I stopped into Giada (2 weeks after opening) and asked how long the wait will be and if i could just find a spot at the bar. The manager at the front of the house said that the bar was being used for overflow, and that the wait would be about 45 minutes to sit. I agreed and went to play some blackjack at the Cromwell. After about an hour, nobody called, so i went to check. Upon arriving, the hostess said that I could be seated. On my way to the seat (which ended up being at the bar), she offered to give me a tour of the restaurant. She showed me the house made pasta, the kitchen, the bread, and other areas, I was very excited to feast. As I sat at the bar, i ordered a McClellan scotch. The bartender then gave me an iPad menu. As I was looking through the menu, i only saw Antipasto dishes. I asked if I could see the complete menu, and was then told that only antipasto is available at the bar. This was not explained to me, and I was even led to believe (due to the tour and conversation with the hostess) that the entire menu was available. After looking at the menu for 15 minutes, I decided I would not eat there because I did not just want antipasto. I asked for the check, but the bartender, Katie (who was amazing) asked me to please stay and said the would find the manager for me. She also said that she would bring me out some antipasto dishes while I was waiting. They brought out some big antipasto dishes, and I will admit that they were quite good. There exceeded my expectations, and I was happy I stayed. Finally as I was eating, the manager did come out. He then went to the couple next to me, and asked them if everything was OK. They said things were fine. I knew he was supposed to ask me, but because I look young and was dressed in a T-shirt, I think he decided to ignore me. The bartender then gesture to him that he was supposed to be talking to ME, He then asked me if everything was OK. I explained the situation to him, and told him I really wanted to try the food from the full menu. I know that he has made this exception for people in the past from talking to the bartender (and that is why she called him), but he decided not to budge for me. He gave me some BS excuse and I could tell he was just not being very genuine. It honestly would have been better for the restaurant to just not even had him come see me. He basically offered nothing and then left. He said he would get me a free drink, that never game So, why 3 stars? The bartender, Katie, is AMAZING, She made a terrible experience great. If not for her, this would have been a 1 star review. She is an asset to Giada. She only charged me for the drinks I had and didn't charge for the food (since I didn't even want to order it). Obviously, she got a large tip. If the manager didn't come out, this would be a 4-5 star review. The manager that came out was terrible. He treated me with little respect and deserved to make this a 1 star review. The management is a liability to Giada, and she should rethink who is running the customer facing team. In addition, they should explain the the full menu is not offered at the bar. I will go back to Giada, sit at a table, and try the full menu. For now, this experience left me in the middle.

 Horrible experience nearly every time I had to go here during my pregnancy. I was left with no choice but to switch drs/ofcs in my last few weeks of being pregnant. If you come into contact with Dr Miller's scheduling nurse, Claudia, beware! She is so rude and was the final straw in deciding to leave this office. She should not be allowed to interact with patients. Even though you have a set Dr you have to see a different Dr every time you go in. Most of the Dr's are condescending and come across offended that you ask questions. Dr Miller rarely made eye contact with me, which is unacceptable from a Dr that will eventually be performing a surgery on me. It felt like a cattle call when you get in there. They want you in and out as quickly as possible. They are irritated when you ask questions. If you are looking for a caring Dr this is not the place to go ",1,0,0,0,0

 Most experiences were fine, with the exception that they seemed a little inconsistent in their pricing. This was confirmed a few months ago when I dropped off a blue dress. My friend picked up the blue dress to borrow, wore it, returned it to be cleaned again. Pricing was an additional $5.00 the second time, for the exact same dress, no stains, nothing out of the ordinary. I showed the cashier my receipt from dropping off the dress the week before. No budge. Not even an effort to explain the pricing difference or an offer to honor the price. He just shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't know why the price was different.

 My husband and I decided we wanted to try a sweet we never had before and while we were at the Nitty Gritty we saw a Gigi's Cupcake car go past the window so we went there. My husband got the wedding cake and Kentucky Bourbon Pie while I chose the Strawberry and Cream cupcake and the Lemon Cheesecake. I have to say I was very disappointed with the sweets. The cakes were good but the frosting was so overly sweet I could not finish it. The Kentucky Bourbon Pie was moist but very heavy and again, overly sweet. I loved the lemon cheesecake but took off the frosting that ringed the lemon filling because of its sweetness. It is too bad the frosting could not be more like the frosting at Carl's Cake..I would then pay the price they are asking for cupcakes. That will be our first and last visit to this establishment.

 3.5 stars. After we went to the movies it was dinner time so we went across the street to La Parilla Suiza. We were greeted and seated and then about 10 mins went by before our server came to take a drink order. Chips and salsa had been placed on the table but no water or drink orders taken. Our server did not seem all that enthusiastic. She seemed as though she was just going through the motions. I told her it was our fist time there so she pointed out some house specialties and then went to get out drinks. I saw they had chilequiles on the menu and I love them and not many places serve them. When I placed my order our server seemed a bit suprised I didn't order one of the higher priced specialties. Our food arrived and it was hot and the chilequiles were good. We were never offered more chips and only checked on once during the meal. The food was fine but the service was lacking, in my opinion. If I was in the area again I would go back and give them another chance. Everyone is entitled to a bad day. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This is definitely one of the pricier restaurants I've ever been to in Charlotte, but that's not saying much. The food is definitely pretty good, with some odd menu items, but they really shocked me with how much flavor they had. The ambiance of the place wasn't too much to my liking, with so many different plates, silverware options, etc...but I'm sure if you're used to this than it's no different than any pricey restaurant. Heck, the waiter even poured the wine for my girlfriend & had her try it before buying (which is apparently customary)... It is in a nice area of Charlotte, close enough to the hustle & bustle but just far enough away. The food, while not top notch, is pretty good & it sure is a nice place to impress a date, but make sure you bring your credit card. ",0,0,1,0,0

 My husband and I were on the prowl for some decent breakfast food and good eats for fathers day in the morning. Well, three places we went had long wait times. Discouraged, we were driving towards home when we saw that the posidon restaurant had finally opened up. Being a big fan of georges gyros and greek food in general, I had looked foward to this place opening since they had a sign up months ago. We pulled in and there were only two customers there, but the smell was great, like garlic and gyro meat. We were seated by a friendly waiter and received our menus, along with glasses of water. The water(which I care about) wasnt bad, like most valley places. It was definitely filtered water with unfiltered ice. My husband still wanted breakfast food, and upon looking over the menu we noticed very good prices, extremely pocket friendly. We were hopeful but concerned that it might be too cheap. We placed the order for the kids breakfast which was one egg,one pancake,one piece sausage,one slice bacon, pita triangles and one piece of ham for 2.95! great deal, especially for my 31/2 year old daughter and the pancake was about 6 inches across. Hubby decided on the greek style breakfast which was 3 eggs with onions tomatoes mushrooms gryo meat and sausage served with potatoes for 6.95. he substituted french fries for potatoes. I ordered the gyro combo with fries, for 6.95, which came with soup or salad. We also ordered spanokopita, orange juice and a coke. Everything was great and decently portioned. I was very happy with my gyro meat, it was just as good as georges, with maybe 5 less pieces, but they dont offer eveything else these guys have so thats in their favor. im comparing them to georges because they are very close to each other and georges has the best gyro in quantity and quality hands down in the valley. So big props to posidon for standing up to my loyalties. Its unquestionable that we will be going back, especially because they have so many more greek items to choose from. Im loving the prices and want to recommend people go there to help them stay afloat. They just opened a few weeks ago, after all. The pita was warm and yummy and the spanakopita im happy to report is done right! Ive been searching for this item all over the place since I was in 7th grade in nyc and I couldnt find the right balance of spinach onions cheese and sour, and now I found it, awesome. We ordered a side of 3 pancakes for hubby to try, and for the 2.70 , we expected little pancakes. They were a full plate size and had the smell of black bear pancakes without being as overly sweet. Turns out he was too full too even eat them. I apppreciated that the garnish of orange slices on hubby and my daughters plates were actually fat and edible, instead of just props. I will say that the lettuce under the spanakopita was unecessary though. I noticed that the feta on my greek salad (which was again another item one step above georges because it had more dressing and it was romaine, not iceberg), as well as on my hot crispy slightly thicker than burger king fries, was stronger than the feta ive been having everywhere and from costco etc. I was so happy because I remember feta from ny being like this. After we finished our food, we asked the waiter about the market next door, he said look throughout and if you see something you like I'll add it on your bill.(convienient!) So we went walking and it was bulk of a lot of import items as well as some deli offerings, it felt like a foreign store or their pantry sort of. We chatted with the owner, he told us he had an import business in losangeles and he distributes to restaurants. I could see why. I asked him about the feta and he told me it was a better quality and I could buy some if I wanted. I got a two pound block for $7 added on to the bill. On the way to pay our bill, he threw in several types of olives for hubby to taste, and on the way out my daughters whining led another waitress to offer her a ""russian tea cake"" type of cookie, which was nice. Over all I feel this place is offering real greek food around a B to B+ in quality for c and d grade prices. Support local businesses, including this one just off of downtown, maybe for breakfast, cheap and yummy! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I'll be quick about this restaurant. When you dine there, you have the choice of dining at the casual, less expensive section in the front or the formal back area, which was much more expensive. Money wasn't a factor for me and my friends, so we went to the formal dining area, which we were told is that they're known for. I had the 6 course Chef's Extravaganza menu, which had (1) a starter that consisted of three types of seafood in some type of broth: scallop, tuna, and salmon; (2) lobster on top of tube like pasta (I can't remember the Italian name), but I found the lobster to be yummy and the pasta to be too salty for my taste; (3) the main course was seared ostrich in some yummy sauce. I wasn't a fan of ostrich, but my friend who helped me finished half of my ostrich loved the dish. Personally, I thought it was not as healthy of a meal as I would like. (4) I also had artisan cheese and fruit, which was good. Again, being on a diet, I only had a few tiny morsels of the cheese. (5) The dessert was amazing, which was a bavarian dish with carmel ice cream, white chocolate sticks, and some other very sweet goodness. There was a 6th dish, but I don't remember what it was. I also ordered half a dozen Kumamoto oysters, which tasted very fresh and wonderful. That and the dessert were probably my favorite dishes that night. Oh before, I forget, I tasted my friend's USDA filet mignon. That's a nice slab of meat that tasted better than my ostrich. For the price, I wish I had been wowed by every one of my dishes. I'd probably give it a 3.5 to 4 stars. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Not a huge fan. I probably won't be back since it's so far North, but the price makes it worth a visit for unlimited margaritas and mimosas.

 Now, my poor rating could possibly be from what i ordered, but that wasn't the full story. I ordered the sliders which came with 3 small different burgers. None of them impressed me much, they were cooked medium which is the only choice for sliders but it was only medium in the very center, the rest was a little too cooked (probably due to the small size). The Hostess seemed extremely unhappy when I arrived with my friends and when i left i said bye, she bid me farewell with the same sad state of emotion... kinda killed it. As i was saying, the burgers lacked any ""interesting"" flavors despite the delicious description in the menu. The sliders were quite small and overall just didn't impress me as far as taste. Even though each burgers used different beef, they all tasted much the same. Presentation was pretty and the fat fries were pretty good but that just didn't cut it for a $20+ bill... i was gonna go for the ballin 60 dollar burger with truffles etc but opted not to at the last moment. Now im curious how that would have been. hahaha ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have been shopping Savers for years. I always bring my Mom and Sister to Savers when they come visit from out of state. We have been known to spend 3-4 hours since we have to go down each aisle. I love books especially children's books. The selection is awesome. I was having a Olivia the Pig birthday party for my daughter and we found 10 softcovered Olivia books for .69 cents each with buy 4 and get one free. So, I had some party favors the kids would really enjoy. You never know what you are going to find. I have gotten some really nice name brand clothes for my daughter. Also, there is a really great selection of purses too. I like how everything is organized and color coded where you can get some extra savings depending on the color. Also, 20% off on Wednesday for senior citizens too. It is worth checking out. ",0,0,1,0,0

 When our AC went out and it was nearly 90 degrees in our house, we were desperate to get the AC fixed. The customer service from the office and the technician were great and they were able to get to us the same day we called -- we appreciated their willingness to come late in the day to make sure we had AC before bed.

 Office management staff is rude and inconsiderate. Trying to win in a no win situation. We dropped by when my wife had an infection in her ear and asked if we would be seen it was about 4 in the afternoon. The office manager said no, however one of the desk clerks found a 430 canceled appointment. The office manager came up to her to reaffirm that we could not take my wife as a walk up even though we have been patients for 8 years. Thanks alot to the desk girl that helped us out. Thumbs down for the office manager. The PA is great, however the Dr im not so sure about. Precribed a sulfa based antibiotic which she had a reaction to. A full body rash. This is the most common problem with this drug. So why not start with something smaller and known to be safer. Additionally my father in law went there for swelling on his leg and he gave him an antibiotic and sent him on his way. When we asked shouldnt he go to the hospital he said no. He died the next week from the staph infection in the leg and kidney failure. Although he did have terminal cancer with proper medical treactment of stronger iv antibiotics he would have most certainly made it a little longer . ",1,0,0,0,0

 Wow... What a pleasant surprise! My boyfriend and I stumbled upon Tequila Taco House because we were staying at the nearby Hilton Garden Inn. All I can say is THANK GOODNESS we found this delightful little restaurant. I absolutely LOVE Mexican food - authentic Mexican, not Tex-Mex, and Tequila Taco House is the real deal! I ordered a burrito and my boyfriend ordered enchiladas, I believe. His enchiladas had a wonderful spicy kick to them, and my burrito was awesome. The meat was perfectly seasoned, and everything was well-prepared. The food is a bit on the pricey side, but you definitely get a more than generous portion of food. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I could like this place more. The food is very good and Extremely close to authentic. The service a little iffy. We were the only ones in the place and our food took forever. Our waiter forgot several orders. The price is extremely high for the food. Even with a discount I was sticker shocked. I mean this isn't a high end steak place, rather it is a very casual Mediterranean restaurant serving normal cuts of meat. The portions are large but I still felt sticker shocked. The spice used is very good and the waiter did take time to explain some items to us, even trying to discourage our teenagers from trying the flavored milk type drink whose name eludes me now. He was right. Take about 3-4 dollars off each dinner plate and this place would rock 4-5 stars. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Honestly I really wanted to love this place. It's very kitschy and super bright inside!! The menu was on the small side but it seemed to have all the tex mex options represented. I would really love to get ONE good tex mex restaurant in the area but this one is not it. First of all they don't have a hot salsa option, not really. Their salsa was okay pretty standard fair, my roommate makes better at home. I ordered a chicken burrito and I'm going to be honest their was like no chicken in my burrito it was mostly filler (beans). The pricing is pretty cheap considering where the restaurant is located so I guess you get what you pay for. I hear they have some kind of nacho buffet and some other things so I may give this place another shot once they've had a chance to be in business a little longer. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We were looking for a place to eat outside on a beautiful February day in the desert and as we were walking to the Wynn, we spotted Lagasse's Stadium. We didn't go immediately, but postponed our trip until after we went to the luxury hotel and casino (and we did ""Wynn"" some money!). We waited a few minutes on some lush couches before being seated at an outdoor table. Most everything on the menu looked good and I wanted to order a shrimp dish, however, when the waitress asked if I wanted a salad to go with it, as there were only three shrimp in the whole dish, I ordered a pulled pork salad. I liked the fact that she was honest. Plus, the shrimp dish was like $15 and the salad was less expensive. My husband had some kind of wrap with sweet potato fries. The salad was kind of small, but since I had indulged in a few buffets already, that was probably a good thing. The restaurant was really cool inside and the bathrooms were very sleek and modern. This would have been a great place to watch a sporting event, with all the comfortable seating and huge TV's. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Your lips are attempting to distract me from the heinous crime you're committing. That's what I said to the urinal in the Men's room at the Harris Grill. The urinal that is a bright-red lipped mouth is a fine idea; however, you blew it when you placed it within 6 inches of the sink, sans partition. Having said that...Harris Grill left a taste in my mouth that wasn't the pink urinal puck...it was of the fine Belgian Ale on tap (a clean tap with ample choices from Troeg to Belgian seasonals) and the half-price wings that were keeping me sweaty on the chilly September Pittsburgh patio. Harris Grill goes down as the first place I fully enjoyed a wing sauce that wasn't Buffalo...their Jamaican Jerk made me boogie. The pulled pork and slaw was traditional, which I appreciated. Forgo the thought you'll park close to Harris...it's tucked in a great neighborhood...embrace the walk. Embrace the heat of the wings. Embrace what local joints in Pittsburgh have to offer.

 We wanted to go to an cafe with WiFi to work on my fav Asian's resume, so I Yelp nearby spots that meets the criteria of free WiFi and also serves food. Two birds with one stone, was the goal. The results in the NW area was slim, but this Tea Time Caf \ u00e9 was one of the top options returned. And after a quick call to confirm the availability of food and something to drink at the same location, off we went. The driving direction was a little off, and it was a good thing that I went with my instinct rather than blindly and obediently following the direction offered up by my GPS (I would have u-turned and completely pass the place and had to double back again). It is in this business park/strip mall type of complex. The place was nearly emptied when we arrived, and there were 2 Caucasian ladies working behind the counter. I immediately thought that that was a little, you know, different! All the boba shops I have ever been to in my entire life had at least an Asian working there. Their menu is reasonably diverse, and offers a good selection of drinks that you would find at your typical boba tea shops in the Chinatown area. Plus they serve food items like simple sushi rolls, spam musubi, and fried potstickers. As far as drink orders, we only ordered off of their Smoothie menu, and I thought it was good. The boba was chewy, but does not have too much bite to it. The decor is simple. Have a comfy couch with a table and the regular tables and chairs. While we were there, the bulk of the customers were actually non-Asians and mostly kids (H.S. age). It is a much different scene than I am used to, but this is cool. If I am in the area and needs a place with free WiFi, I would be back. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The atmosphere is awesome. We had gotten a seat by the window, and had an awesome view of the strip. We came here for my friend's 21st birthday. I ordered the peach passion drink, it was good but not too strong. For an appetizer, we ordered the filet mignon wrapped asparagus, they were decent. we ordered a couple of sushi rolls, the rice is a bit dry... some of the rice was even hard. i've definitely had better sushi rolls other places. The bill was pretty high for just the two of us. But, the place gets an a-ok to me because as we were leaving, our server surprised us with free shots for my friend's birthday. ",0,0,1,0,0

 A group of us arrived at the Golden Nugget wed night, and went to check in; both of our reservations were messed up. I was in the Gold Tower and it should have been a nonsmoking room, and my friends where in another tower and theirs should have a king nonsmoking room. The front desk didn't seem to care that we did not get what we asked for and when making the reservation, like most of you know have to pay for your 1st night. Well just because you paid your 1st night that does not give you what you paid for. Was told since we checked in after 10 that is why the nonsmoking rooms are gone, due to people coming and renting rooms. WOW really? Was placed on the 2nd floor in the gold tower and was placed in a room with a great view of the back of Golden Nugget sign on for Freemont st,,,,yea that rocked. The staff was unfriendly and not very helpful. It felt like the ""if you don't like it you can leave"" attitude was displayed by the entire staff. The room was nice other than the view, there was no need to even open the window. That was my 1st time staying at the Golden Nugget and mostly my last. But on the plus side The Tank rocked, however little disgusted with that fact that you have to rent chairs by the pool when its already only hotel guest that can get into the Tank. The shark tank is very cool and the pool that wraps around it is nice, enjoyed watching the fish, friends went on the slide through the shark tank that was good times. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I know.. an update with the same rating, but I just cannot get over how amazing of an experience it is every time I walk into this store. I was in there most recently a few days ago, hoping to find a bit of good luck in the clothes department, as I had been wearing cargo pants forever. That in combination with not being able to fit into most of my cargo pants, I was dying for a skirt. Jinia and I talked for at least an hour as I got to see all the new things going on and catch up. I ended up trying on a few pieces I never thought would work with me, including a skirt made of neckties and a strapless mini dress. The end result? All of them looked fabulous and I walked out with them all. The necktie skirt is my absolutely favorite piece and everyone that's seen it thinks it's a true gem. The necktie line also includes brooches and purses.. definite must sees! If you haven't been yet, you're truly missing out! ",0,0,0,0,1

 After 10 years of being a customer here and paying top dollar for service and labor, I am no longer coming here for any service or even to purchase a Toyota ever again. The charged me once for an air filter & I caught it before I left. I was mad so they gave me a free future oil change. The kicker for me was this: My older 4Runner was in an accident so I purchased an older Lexus but was taking it here for oil changes instead of Lexus where they charge double. I guess Findlay got tired of doing this and they told me from now on it was going to cost me $60. For an OIL CHANGE. Not Synthetic oil or anything. Goodbye Findlay .. Enjoy less customers.

 I pulled up and the guys who wrote me up was very pleasant and let me know that the $15.99 car wash was on special for $12.99 so I said what the heck. The rest of the staff was also very polite but my problem is with the actual wash. We had gone camping the day before and the interior was a little dusty. My car was only about 10 days old so it was pretty clean save the dust. I gave the guy a tip without really checking the car but when I got home from the front seats back the car still had a layer of dust on it. I got a damp cloth wan wiped it down and now it looks like it should have. If I wanted to clean the interior my self I would have gone to the $3.00 car wash. I guess Francis & Sons should probably put the Wife & Daughter in charge. I won't be going back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Cool experience that I really wish we had in Toronto! I came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch with my family. The place was packed full and there were two other groups ahead of us waiting to be seated, so we had to wait about 15 or so minutes. My first impression of the place is that it is quite small and also pretty cramped. Tables are placed pretty close together and there is not that much room to walk around, unfortunately. I wish there was more space for us to actually play with the cats. All of the food we ordered was delicious. I had the Cat Lady, which is a gourmet sandwich with fig jam, honey, goat cheese, cheddar, and caramelized onions. It sounds so simple, but it was so tasty, and the perfect blend of sweet and salty flavours. It also came with a very refreshing and fresh tasting salad on the side. We also ordered La Jardiniere, which was basically fresh seasonal vegetables on a piece of crispy fried dough, and Tartine du Jardin, which was another sandwich loaded with lots of ricotta, vegetables, grilled nuts, and peaches. Although I didn't try either of the other items we ordered, the general consensus among my family was that the food was very fresh, very delicious, and very filling. Everything on their menu is vegetarian, and they also have some vegan and gluten free options too! They own 7 cats, and on the day I went I managed to see 6 of them. The cat part is kind of hit or miss, because it's kind of luck of the draw depending on when you go. There were three cats awake when we first arrived, so we got a chance to play with them a little while we were waiting for our seats. However, later on they all fell asleep, so they weren't as lively and didn't walk around as much as I expected. It was a little disappointing for me, but what can you do. It is still a cool concept though and I enjoyed my experience. The cafe is very bright and clean on the inside, so it's really nice to be in there. I read some reviews about odours, but I didn't smell anything unpleasant at all. Everything on their menu is pretty pricey - lunch for three ended up being about $60! Two of us ordered hot drinks (hot chocolate and chai latte), and while they were both good, they were $4+ dollars each. That being said, if you are a cat lover like I am, this is definitely something neat to check out! If you are lucky you might encounter the cats when they are actually awake. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My husband and I found this little gem of a theater thanks to Groupon, and the price was good for a spontaneous date night, so we decided to buy it and use it on their midnight improv show (which starts at 11:45PM, be warned!). We showed up twenty minutes early and were literally the only guests there until about five minutes before showtime. We started to panic thinking we might be the only ones in the audience. Improv is awkward enough... imagine the entertainers performing for an audience of two. Cue cringe. Fortunately, the place filled up right before the show began, and we were on our way. The place itself is... quaint? Seats aren't super comfortable, there is no stadium seating or anything like that, but the walls are really neat and littered with awards, performers' profiles, and retro posters. There is also a concession stand on the way into the theater. Overall, the establishment on first impression is great, but the theater itself was lacking a little. Kind of blah, like a cafeteria or something with dim lights to make it seem more homey. I know that this was an improv show, but I feel like the announcer should at least be prepared confidently host, but it seemed like they just took him off the street and said, ""Hey, I need you to introduce this thing, come with me!"" I'm certainly not upset about that, but it was just a little thing that I think they can improve on. I was also sad that out of the ten or so performers, not one was a woman. I know that they do have women performers for other shows, but I feel like they should have women represented in every show. I know this is a personal preference, but I really would have enjoyed it more, had there been a few qualified females onstage. That being said, although as with improv, not everything will be a hit, I found a lot of the content pretty darn funny. There were two guys that really stole the show (bearded chubby man and tan dude with glasses, I'm looking at you), but overall the performers were entertaining and fun to watch. I would likely come back again, because my husband and I did have a good time overall, and the tickets are inexpensive. Check it out if you have the time, and keep an eye out on Groupon for good deals! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I love salad bars. Love. LOVE. But I can't eat here. And by that I don't mean that it isn't veg-friendly - it most def is - I mean that the quality of ingredients, salad, toppings, potato bar, made-from-powder soups are so low that I get scared. Fear is an appetite inhibitor. I've hit this trough three times, and had gurgley tummy after each and every one. The ladies that work here are totally great - even acknowledge and remove and replace, say, the cukes, when I express concerns about their harboring of evil bacteriums and such (WOW they smelled weird last time I was here). But any effort on my part to save my and others' bellies from grossville feels like polishing the brass on the Titanic. So I continue to harass Sweet Tomatoes via email, monthly, with the hopes that one day we'll actually have a decent Bar in Charlotte. Fingers crossed. I might start a petition.

 My drama queen dog giving me panic attacks yet again. She had been scooting for about a week but I didn't think much of it since she has never had an issue with expressing and has only had her anal glands expressed once as part of a comprehensive exam (and they didn't even end up having to do it, because the second they got remotely close to her butt, she freaked out and did it herself, all over the poor tech. Charming, I know.) All of a sudden she is crying, whining, constipated, won't even let me hold her, and her tummy is harder than usual. I try to get a look at her backside (the joys of dog parenthood) and can feel that her glands are definitely full and possibly impacted. I, of course, assume the worst and am imagining $5000 vet bills for ruptured glands/something else causing the issue/who knows what. I checked Alta Vista's hours (still open til 10 PM! YAY) and called to see how busy they were, and was told they were pretty cramped but to come in as a walk-in. They were lovely yet again when we showed up and Lucy didn't even need to see the vet - she was in and out with one of the techs in a short amount of time and came back to the waiting room a new dog after having her VERY full glands expressed. She has been her happy self since. The damage was under $20 and they were quick and nice as ever. We love Alta Vista! ",0,0,0,0,1

 So, I have a love hate relationship with Toss't or Earth which it is now called. The Love: I am single and buy groceries for one so I don't often have a lot of different produce sitting around because it will spoil before I can use it all. It is great to be able to get a good salad downtown. This is the only salad shop of its kind in downtown Pittsburgh at least that I know of. Also, they allow you to switch out some options of pre-made salads which is great because their pre-made salads are cheaper than if you made your own salad choosing the same ingredients. The Hate: They are often out of ingredients. Over half the time I am there I have to substitute ingredients for ingredients in my salad that they are out of. The most frustrating thing though is when they forget ingredients in my salad. This has happened numerous times. They have forgotten the goat chesse (a $1.25 charge) the avocado (and today they forgot the salmon (a $3 charge). Unfortunately, I always get them to go so by the time I realize I can't do anything about it. I shouldn't have to scrutinize the making of my salad to make sure they include all the ingredients. Really, if it weren't for the fact that expensive ingredients get left out of my salad I would have given 5 stars, but I hate that I've probably lost about $10 so far in forgotten ingredients (I've gone here about once a week for a few months). If you are ok with that or you really watch what they put in your salad I would definitely say go. ",0,0,1,0,0

 My dad has been going here for a while with his dog, but it wasn't until my cat got sick that I checked them out. I went in expecting them to start telling me all of these things I would have to do and money I would have to spend. The first few visits them did the exact opposite. They told me stuff to do which would hopefully help her without surgery. But it didn't work, she finally needed a feeding tube. After a few weeks I am happy to say she is well on her way to her old self and couldn't be happier!!! Every time I went in for a check up, the staff and tech's couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. Dr. Penn specifically felt like he went way out of his way to help and was extra friendly & understanding in this very stressful time. Can't say enough great things about them!

 I love going to this place during my late night facades, why? Because it's open 24hrs! Now I'm not much of a smoothie fan, the only one I seem to order is banana. Although, I did get to try the Citrus Iced Green Tea Matcha and it was pretty good. The things I recommend here are there wraps! I'm so in love with the buffalo chicken wrap, I have to have it like every other time. It's sooooo good especially when served right off the press. It's stuffed with light ranch, buffalo sauce, chicken, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese wrapped into white wrap. Can you say delicious? Yes, it is indeed. Every other wrap is ok, nothing to brag about. I did try the thai-chicken one. Ok, that one....was a killer. I was not impressed. The flavors were mediocre, I suggest you stay away from that one if you're looking to eat the wraps section. I like the atmosphere of the place, the people are nice and it's never crowded. Parking's always available, and there's not hassle if you wanna do take out. The only thing that gets me here, is the price. But I guess for a well stuffed wrap, the price is all right. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Today my daughter went to the LC and they lost the order and she did not get the food for over 45 minutes. The said the order was not placed in 'it was lost for a few minutes'. The order goes from the counter where you place the order to less than 10 feet away to the cooking area. She probably wished she had just left because she got food poisoning from the Los Chief salad. She had a large order and the food was placed in a cardboard box that she took to her car. NONE of the plates inside of the box were secured for travel; simply two paper plates with the food on the bottom plates. The enchiladas spilled off the plate and the poisoned Los Chief salad placed between the plates also spilled off. They used to put the salad in a bowl and tape it shut. She said the tortilla for the cheese crisp was stale and just lousy tasting. I'd warned her I no longer would order anything but their shredded beef tacos. I use to get the green chili burrito but the last time I ordered it was made with a store bought tortilla. It was gross. My family has been going to this restaurant since the 60's. The food was excellent and service outstanding. However; the owner of the restaurant Mary died and the food has been going to h*ll rapidly. The service is with a snotty attitude that the management is doing a favor to serve to the customer. There's just too many good Mexican restaurants to waste your money here! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Although I've only been to Lisa G once, the service at the bar was great, the food was excellent (I had the Juno sandwich), and the atmosphere was fine. I look forward to going back soon. UPDATE: Ok, I've been back to Lisa G several times now with a friend who works in the area. I must say, I really like the food. So does my friend. It's quality stuff, what can I say. Everyone is friendly; I've never come close to the experience that Nadia C. had. Although I think she overreacted. In the owner's defense, she has a small area in the front of the restaurant that she requests people use for meetings after they've finished eating and only if there's a wait. Since my first visit, I've ordered the Juno again (super yummy!) and Lisa's award winning balls. I must say, they were quality balls. My taste buds prefer sweeter balls, but these were really good. You can tell a lot of love went into making these balls. When I go I usually drink Voss sparkling water, but they do have an interesting soda collection (as was mentioned previously) that I look forward to sampling in the near future.

 It's nice having a somewhat healthy place in the Phoenix metro area. This place is a tad bit overpriced I feel. I went in and basically just wanted a bunch of veggies...like a veggie platter. I was happy that they were able to accommodate my request since there is no such thing on the menu. Lesson learned....ORDER OFF THE MENU. This thing cost me $18!

 After 2 days of sub-mediocre conference food at a nearby hotel, I was desperate for something real, and something vegetarian that went beyond cheese pizza. Meskerem satisfied perfectly. It's not fancy, in fact, it's rather dingy. It's in a strip mall just off Las Vegas Blvd. and it's next to the sorts of down-on-your-luck stores one might usually find in a strip mall. But that does not matter, because Meskerem makes delicious food that will restore you. I ordered a vegetarian sampler platter (although it was cryptically called something else on the menu). It arrived with plenty of delicious injera bread to mop up the varieties lentils and greens spread out on even more injera. I kept eating and eating, feeling more and more restored with each bite. Then I got a little worried about what all of those lentils and greens might do to my digestion. However, there was nothing to worry about. It was the most satisfying meal I had during my stay in Las Vegas. Leaving the restaurant, I felt refreshed and ready to tackle another day of exciting powerpoint presentations! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I think this is going to be my favorite fro-yo place. I liked the decor and the large selection of flavors, they not only had PISTACHIO, but also Banana, my two favorite. Also, the texture seemed to be creamier than others. I liked that the seating is low and round, so I can bring the twins without too much worry about sharp corners. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I had exactly 30 minutes to spare and it happened to be lunch time, so I figured why not try this little sushi place. I sat at the sushi bar where my order was taken and filled faster than I could have hoped - had my food within five minutes of arrival. I had a delicious and fabulously priced lunch special of miso soup, spicy tuna roll, and New York roll, the latter of which was the highlight of the meal. Definitely recommended! ",0,0,0,0,1

 We had just arrived in Vegas on a Thursday afternoon and wanted our first meal after flying all morning to be great. Mon Ami Gabi did not disappoint. We arrived around 2PM and were seated at an outside table with a fantastic view of The Eiffel and of he Strip for prime people watching. Service was attentive. Food was quite yummy. We ordered a new drink on the menu that had lavender, pineapple and vodka. It was so divine we had two (first bartender made it better than the second). We kept it simple with a shrimp cocktails appetizer (fresh, plump and succulent) and with burgers which came with their hand cut fries. Delicious and believe me, it is in fact easy to mess up a burger. The hand cut fries were perfect for snacking on later in the day. I wish I had been brave enough to order the lobster roll. Something tells me they would have in fact done it justice. Highly recommend this place. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The best coffee cafe I've ever been to, ever. I love this place. The decor and ambiance is top notch. The food is good and breakfast comes out quickly. All the different areas are unique and one has a projection screen. Fresh squeezed juice is a nice touch. Serves alcohol. I could go on and on and on but I'd give Lux six stars if I could; and this is saying a lot considering that I have an east coast bias. Lux would kick the ass of any of the hipster coffee shops in Manhattan or Williamsburg any day. ",0,0,0,0,1

 NO MEAL DEAL?!?!? $7.50 for a 6"" sub? NO REFILLS? what is going on here? this is the subway from the twilight zone. This subway is located in the Southwest Airlines terminal and is the worst subway in the world. the food itself is okay, but you wait FOREVER. talk about inefficiencies! (1) there is a separate queue for pilots and flight attendants, but their orders get mixed into the queue of regular customers. this caused major backups and even instances where the sandwich maker mixed up pilot sandwiches with regular customers! (2) we waited FOREVER. i think 30 minutes? and we were only 8 deep when we joined the line (3) there is no number three...just turn around and go to the sbarro's! at least you get a whole slice of pizza and a drink for $7.50!

 Disclaimer: I'm not being fair as I have zero tolerance for food prepared for 200 people sitting in the chafing dish for hours slowly getting burnt on the bottom and cold on the top. It is ironic to have to wait for 45 minutes to be seated (and be $24.95 + tax poorer), considering that I managed to get into The Bank the night before with no wait (and not have to be out of pocket). In any case, the food never fails to disappoint. I once watched a feature on TV (PS: the only thing that I watch is Food Network and Travel... and occassional bit of American Idol) on how they source the ingredients for buffet food. While it was not able to gross me out and put me off buffet forever, it's enough to get me into thinking that the prime rib that they had served in Le Village Buffet is the one that is near or past the expiry date @ Les Artistes. I could not help but be slightly perturbed. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Alright yall. Time to get REAL. As a proud black man who has experienced a plethora of sumptuous dining and everything beneath, I can tell you with authority that this place is too HYPED. Me and mah girl got drinks and sushi (Tamari rolls and Sexy Dragon rolls). The only thing sexy about them rolls was me and mah girl. Basically, the sushi was just decent. At $22 a freakin roll, I expected a Japanese symphony in my mouth. But what I got instead was an old mime from the streets of Tokyo. It tasted decent, fresh, whatever, but it had NO SOUL! Now, all you hipsters on this site should know by now that sushi is all about rice, and fish. It's simple, YA HEAR?! So these fools sauce it up all gooey-like, shaving green onions and what not, confusing the flavor and so forth. Basically, I coulda been eating a raw hot pocket, but the sauce would have fooled me. I thought of that documentary, Juro Dreams of Sushi. I'll bet if Juro was in that joint, he'd be swinging the samurai sword, laying an ASS-WHOOPIN on the folks who came up with that menu. Do yourself a favor: order decent sushi elsewhere. Then, set your wallet on fire--cause you AINT gonna have money left after you eat this average food. Then, pass out on the couch, where I'm gonna be in a minute. PEACE YALL ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've been to 808 Tapas many times now but owe it to them to add a review finally. I first tried this place (not knowing it was the same guys as 808 Sushi) after finding a groupon. Where to start? Happy Hours every day that they're open, check for specific times but half price sushi rolls is all you have to know. Consistently fresh food, tons of options for every palette, you'll have to go a couple times just to try everything that looks good! See if the Super White sashimi is available. Hot and cold items, sushi rolls and sake. Friendly service, never had to ask for my drink to be filled, servers are very attentive and on point. Sushi chefs very helpful and easy to talk to, everyone in the place seemed to be having a great time. Check out this hidden gem, you won't be dissapointed! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I feel I'm always the last person to try these new local spots. I can't believe how close this is and I'm just now getting around to trying it. I was back twice in one week, that says a lot. I was heading over to Julie T's place to see the new baby, and I needed to bring something, I was trying to be sneaky and surprise her (and then I saw she already wrote a review) so my plan was foiled. I originally had planned to get an entire coconut chiffon cake, but then decided to buy one of everything so that way we could all try a sample of each. Wow, when we opened the box of treasures, it was like opening a present. We all passed around the desserts, and all you could here was ""mmmmm"" and ""OMG"" we couldn't help ourselves. I really couldn't tell you what my favorite was, as they all were so good. I still thinking about the Mille-Crepe and the Yuzu Panna Cotta as well as the Mont Blanc. Surprisingly, the Green Tea Cake was my least favorite, just didn't get me like the rest of them did.

 The sign boasts ""Best Mexican Sandwich in Montreal"". Not knowing what a Mexican sandwich was in the first place, I was sceptical, but intrigued. The inside is cozy, and the decor is hip. In particular I like the flashy Vegas style Virgin Mary ornament near the cash. I got the pulled pork sandwich to go, and it really hit the spot. The bread was tasty and I liked the jalapeno sauce that came with it too.

 I found the monorail to be of great use. It's not exactly an image of my ""ideal"" monorail system [for Vegas], but no major complaints. I wish the taxi cabs would just swallow their prides or whatever because airports and customers, I believe, thrive from having transportation options - plus, it doesn't pollute and get stuck in traffic. This darn thing needs to get to the airport eventually and the taxi cab co.'s should just rearrange their plans and do station feeding or something - be creative. Feedback: some escalators didn't look functional for awhile; access isn't the greatest and I don't like the compartment-style monorail cars. They should be walk-through, like every other major monorail system in the world (think Tokyo, Dubai, Singapore, Chongqing, Kuala Lumpur, Osaka... etc). ",0,0,0,1,0

 While staying at the Wynn, I opted to ""take out"" at Wazuzu and bring dinner back to my room. I've never done this before but when I asked, they were more than accomodating - much much better choice than room service. I opted to go with a bit of ""dim sum"" for myself. I went with the pan fried pork dumplings, spicy tuna roll and shu mai (shrimp and pork dumplings steamed). All were delicious, served with enough sauce, utensils and napkins. Very delicious and flavorful. The restaurant was quite busy when I was waiting for my order so I would say whether eating in or taking out, go for Wazuzu if you want a great Asian meal at Encore (or Wynn which is attached via a corridor).

 Ghettooooo. This is the type of store where they have the Tide on lock down and anything you might be able to make meth out of only sold in limited quantities. The customer base is a blend of tweakers, unplanned pregnancies and foreign exchange students who have a look of, ""I left Finland for this?"" on their faces. I almost bought some neckbones (I'm black don't judge me) but there was so much blood in the pkg I was afraid I'd find a severed hand in there when I got home. #pass I'm not even sure how I ended up here.

 I was FINALLY able to try the famous Burgatory here in Pittsburgh! Some of my first thoughts--very cool looking place! I love the walls and decorations they have around the joint. The bar is also very contemporary and sits nicely in the restaurant. The burgers? Good--but I have to report (sadly) that I was a bit underwhelmed. Perhaps it's because there has been so much hype about these places and from my friends that I thought that the burger would have just blown me away. I had a milkshake for desert. Spiked was a little too rich I thought. Is it worth it? Sure, but not for a 30 minute plus wait. Come check it out for yourself! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I totally forgot about Merc until the other night when my companion and I required additional alcoholic beverages after the bottle of wine we'd inhaled at True Foods. Quite an improvement since the days when we'd run across Camelback in heels, hoping a Beemer-driving drunk wasn't careening down the road at that exact time. The tunnel makes your transition into the dark sultriness of the Merc Bar that much easier. OK, admittedly, I forgot how sexy it is. I suppose in my more actively drinking days we'd end up here on the weekends, when it was SRO and the music rendered all conversation impossible. On weeknights, it's a different scene. Quiet, but not awkwardly so. Our server? Super hot, wearing an extremely short dress, doing lots of bending over and squatting at inopportune times, thus sending my companion into a bit of a frenzy. In addition to being hot, she was actually nice. A rarity, no? I know the drinks are expensive. What is the special ingredient they add behind the bar? Roofies? All I know is, I went in very mildly buzzed and left shitfaced. No, I'm not complaining. Rad. It's going back on my weeknight rotation. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Yeah I'm reviewing this watered down Filipino restaurant. Reason why I came to eat here was because I was in the mood for a Filipino breakfast and this was the closest one to my gf's house. What a bad choice. Sorry babe. Lol I ordered the tocino breakfast, which came with like 6 small pieces of pork, garlic fried rice and fake scrambled egg with a tomato slice on it, and let me tell you... The tomato was so good! And that's it. My gf ordered the spam breakfast.... The spam was cut the wrong way. How do you cut spam the wrong way? If it has squared edges you cut it the wrong way!! It has to have the rounded edges. Spam lovers, YOU know what I mean! Our meals came with free coffee by the way and tasted horrible.. no wonder why it's free. Good thing I got a cup of water too. And the service was annoying, no kind of personality or enthusiasm, when I asked for ketchup, she gave me 3 packets.. I looked at it as she placed it in my palm... I said, can i get more please, she grabbed 2 more.. paused to think.. and grabbed another 1 packet. Ay yi yi! 2 stars for the tomato, and good water. Next time I come here is probably because I want something from Red Ribbon which is unfortunately, conveniently located inside Jolibee. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My girlfriend and I have been going here for about 2 years now. The last two times here the service and food have gone downhill. Great location and view is awesome.

Hope they fix the problems. Also it's extremely noisy with the band playing. I figured the band was on the weekend but it seems every night.

 My wife and I went to Odana after it was recommended by several people. We recently moved to the area and were looking to furnish our new home. After finding several items from the same seller that we were interested in, my wife went to get the sales person to inquire about what the ""best price"" was for the bundle. I have never paid the listed price for any item in an antique/vintage store and have often had the sales people walk by and say ""we can do better on those prices if you're interested"" when I stop to look at something......once the sales person arrived at the booth, he was very short with us and seemed very disinterested in facilitating a sale. He stated what they could take off the price without contacting the dealer and was pushy that we used cash or check. His tone and attitude towards us was as though we wouldn't be able to afford the items and when I asked him to contact the dealer he was reluctant to do so and very offensive in his assumption that we would be making a ""low ball"" offer (words he actually used). My wife and I look young, but are both in our 30s and have been out of college working good jobs for several years. His assumption that we were broke college kids was out of line and cost the store business. We walked off and left the store only to stop at the front and tell the manager that they just lost out on at least a $1000 sale. Too bad for the dealer who had their items on sale at Odana. We won't be going back. Hope others have a better experience. They have some nice stuff, but I don't like to do business with douche bags. ",1,0,0,0,0

 A group of us ate dinner at MOzen during CES week. We changed our reservations 3x and they were very accommodating. I must say, the experience wasn't what I hoped for. The Mandarin Oriental is such an elegant & high-end chain that I expected much more from their restaurant. MOzen isn't fancy, which is totally fine, but their prices didn't justify the fare. The menu is all over the place. Some would call it diverse but I call it awkward. They have Sushi so there's your Japanese option, then Indian dishes for another Asian feature, then randomly you see a Caprese salad and Osso Bucco. Didn't know Italian food was somehow related to Asian fusion. I had Osso Bucco at a fine establishment the previous night so I wasn't tempted to order it again but I found it interesting to see on the menu. Stumped & dissatisfied w/their selections, my fianc \ u00e9 & I decided to order sushi and small plates to share rather than an entree. -------------------------- Spicy Tuna Roll = 3 stars * average spicy tuna roll. Menu states that it's blended with spicy chili aioli but I couldn't taste it. Tempura Shrimp Roll = 3.5 stars * surprisingly better than I expected. It was crunchy but not overdone w/batter. 72 Hour Kobe Short Rib = 2.5 stars * loved the edamame puree but the short rib was way too fatty. I know fat gives it flavor but I don't want 50% fat on such a small serving of short rib. Calamari = 3.5 stars * served with 2 dipping sauces - marinara and saffron-dijon aioli. Better than average but nothing to rave about. Could've used some seasoning. Blackened Albacore Tuna Tataki = 4.5 stars * my favorite selection in the entire evening. Fresh & flavorful Albacore Tuna and nice presentation. Sauces complimented the tuna well. Lychee Smash = 3 stars * delicious mojito-style cocktail but it didn't really do it for me. I think it was $19 and for that price, I expected some kick. Lychee Martini = 3 stars * for my 2nd drink I decided not to refill the Lychee Smash and ordered a typical Lychee Martini. It wasn't on the menu and our waiter said he'd have to check if they can make it. Really? Anyway, apparently they can make it but it was so frothy. Never had a frothy version of this martini before. It was ok and same price as the 1st drink. I should've just ordered wine. -------------------------- Our bill came out to ~$550 for a group of 4. This is a bit much for an unsatisfactory experience. Dim lighting, amazing views of City Center, and culinary displays of food may be the only justification for their prices. In that regard, MOzen deserves 5 stars. I read some good reviews on their breakfast so that may be the only time I dine here again. Pass on dinner. It's mediocre and overpriced. ",0,0,1,0,0

 So, for our anniversary last week, my love told me to get dressed and that she had some surprises for me. A surprise?? For me?! I thought to myself, ""Sweet!"" Actually it turned out to literally be sweet when she told me we were going truffle shopping. Scuse me?! We stopped in and I was overwhelmed by the awesomeness that was before me. She told me to pick out whatever I wanted, and pick I did! I ordered 2 kahlua, 2 roasted raspberry, 2 rose, 2 chai (which had edible shiny gold stuff on it!!) and 4 salted caramel truffles. Then we picked out two desserts, a tiramisu (with a large white chocolate flower on top) and a flourless chocolate cake. They also had a great variety of cookies and other little desserts. They had many other flavors and delights and I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for greatness. And I really dig the fact that it's a local business.

 Sushi Kee is good but not great. We went in on a Saturday night and the had all you can eat sushi for 25 dollars per person. Of course we had to try that, who can't eat 25 dollars in sushi? Sushi Kee didn't offer a wide of variaty in sushi almost all had eel and really how much eel can someone have? The soup and salad came in a timely manner. The sushi came out a few plates at at time probably because we didn't have enough room on our table. The rolls were good not great. They came apart when trying to pick them up which makes a mess but again they were good. The sushi was well, shall I say good but warm?! Yes, I said warm that kind of turned my stomach but I figured it was from the rice (I don't know what was going through my mind at that time). I'm not an expert but I eat sushi almost every day and I know a tiny bit about things and even though Sushi Kee has their own way of making and preparing their sushi, I have had better elsewhere. I would NOT say pass on Sushi Kee but instead say go and have good sushi there and have a nice time out with someone. The wait staff was very friendly. Avarage restaurant with avarage sushi.

 My wife wanted to eat something spicy for lunch, so she said let's hit some local Thai. We had never eaten Thai in the East Valley, so we went onto Yelp and read some of the reviews. This restaurant is very close to my office, so we decided to give it a shot. Service was so-so, but it was a lunch crowd, so I think they were doing the best they could. Our order was taken after a bit of delay, but our food came out in decent time afterward. We both had Pad Thai noodles on the lunch menu, which came with a small soup, some fried wonton skins, and an egg roll. Have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The noodles were exceedingly tasty. We set the heat at ""medium"" but probably should've bumped it up a tad. However, at medium it allowed us to savor the flavor. For the two of us, the bill was $15 (we had water), so it was extremely inexpensive, and there was plenty of food. Quite happy, we will definitely eat here again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We went to the Bistro Buffet at the Palms so I could get my once every six months craving for buffet out of the way. I like to try different ones each time since it's really about getting to eat as many different tasty things at once. Frankly, I'm glad I won't be experiencing the Bistro again. My biggest problem was that the food was bland. Nothing had spices, or even just salt and pepper. My second problem was that there were about 6-7 options for barbecued meats, and not a lot else for meat. I could have overlooked this but again, the barbecue sauce was not very flavorful. The final problem with this buffet had to do with service. Both times I tried to get carved meat, no one was there. I waited the second time for about 3-4 minutes, and no one every offered to help me, even though they were nearby. They also keep very few pies sliced and waiting. Instead, you have to wait for someone to slice is for you. For some pies this is nice as it keeps them cool, but the apple pie was downright cold, and would have benefited from sitting out of the cooler. The only good service we got was from our waitress, who kept our six cups full, and our dirty plates picked up. The only saving grace for me was the baklava, a special dessert for the night. If you like snow crab legs, they looked good, but no one at my table wanted to try them. Overall, the Bistro Buffet is not worth leaving the Strip for if you are visiting. The buffets at Wynn and the Cosmo are better, even if they do cost more. For locals, I would put the Bistro Buffet about on par with any Station Casino buffet, and we all know how those can go. One tip for saving some money, anyone with the Palms players card gets a discount if they pay in cash so that can save you a few buck. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Tucked away on the side of Aria (too bad not completely hidden out of sight) is this place. New, modern, industrial-styled restaurant which follows the theme of City Center nicely. That is where the impressiveness ends. Once seated you get a menu that offers a variety of rolls and sashimi. I should have left when I saw the ridiculous prices of 1 vs. 2 pieces of sashimi ($10-20 vs $30-40!?!?!!)! Typically I don't mind paying for great food and a great experience which is what i thought i was going to get when I ordered the Chef's Tasting menu ($100/person). Yes, the food was good but the value left me hungry a half hour after I left. I can't even remember what I had because it was all eaten in about 10 bites...you're better off going to cosmo and getting 2 slices of pizza for 10 bucks that's going to at least leave you satisfied. I am mostly mad at myself for trying this place on a whim and not consulting with Yelp beforehand. Thats the last time I try to be adventurous (probably not but you know what I mean). The quality of food and service can be had elsewhere for a fifth of the price, I dont care if it is on the glorified strip and in a glorified hotel, you have to be wiping with benjamin's to eat at this place.

 The first time we went here we samples all of the different juices, and the owner sold us on the cleanse package, telling us that if we returned the bottles, that they would give us $1 off per bottle. When we got home late afternoon, we noticed 4 of the juices expired that day, and we needed to drink them that evening (not thrilled). We didn't get the chance to drink them all in time before they expired. We decided for us, we would prefer to go buy the juice that we intend to drink instantly. When we went back today, we brought the 12 bottles back, and just wanted 2 drinks. They told us that they would take the 12 bottles ($12 off), but only give us $2 off this order, with a receipt showing an additional 10 bottles returned. I explained that we only intend to buy drinks as we drink them, so we won't ever buy 12 at a time again. They said ""that's fine, but we can't give you the discount"". Bottom line: they are willing to give a discount of $1 per bottle returned. But they will only do it bottle for bottle, meaning that they try to lock you in to buying bulk. I hate small businesses that hide behind bate-n-lock-in ""policy"" over common sense and putting the customer first. Customer service is poor here. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Place was very convenient for us since we were staying in Cosmopolitan, but that's about the only good thing I can say about this place. The service was decent, but not what I would expect from a high end restaurant at all. We had the Sushi platter (about 10 piece i think), Sashimi platter (around 10 piece) , Beef Fried rice, and fried oysters. About $200 with couple of beers. The quality and freshness of the fish was on par with my local places (san ramon, ca) at about a fifth of the price. I had some good fish in San Francisco in a similar price range, and this place does not hold candle to it at all. Perhaps I didn't drink enough to dull my taste buds... ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have been waiting to try this place for months now. Purchased a Local Dines coupon and went the other day for lunch. First impression was a little strange as there is no table service. You are pleasantly greeted by a nice hard working elderly lady who instructs you to order at the window and then take a seat while your food is prepared. Once the food is ready she beckons to you from across the room so that you can come pick up your food in the window. Not sure if this is just a lunch thing and if dinner service has a different system but once I understood how the system worked it was fine. As for the food... We ordered the famed bolognese ragu over linguine, chicken parm., and fettuccine alfredo. My wife had the bolognese and said it was just okay. The pasta overwhelmed the dish with very little bolognese mixed in so it was a little dry and flavorless, somewhat disappointing. The chicken parm. was actually pretty tasty in my opinion and worthy of ordering again. The fettuccine alfredo was not good at all. Very basic pasta with cream. There was no real taste at all and was a total disappointment. Overall I think that this place rides on the coattails of the triple D review from Guy Fieri. I do not understand the long lines and rave reviews to be honest. Oh, one last thing... As previously mentioned we used a Local Dines $15 for $30 worth of food coupon. When I got the bill at the end the nice older lady added up the food, deducted the coupon amount,then proceeded to add 18% gratuity to the bill based on the total amount without even asking. I have no issue with a tip, but presuming 18% when there is no real table service, just a woman beckoning to you from a window, well I thought that a bit much. Yes, she did come out from behind the window and was very nice, but it was not her position to add 18% tip to a four top table. At the end of the day this place is 35 minutes from my home and in no way justifying of the drive and a follow up visit. Sorry Giuseppe's on 28th, I wish I had found a true hole in the wall to call home, but to the contrary was disappointed with your food. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Loud, annoying and uncomfortable. Perhaps, I am a Californian at heart, but the several times I was here, it was not the greatest experience. Tex-mex food. The menus are trying too hard to be witty.

 I've been wanting to try this place for years!! Frozen hot chocolate was good, everything else.... Not so much. Definitely do not get their dry ass beef ribs that came with 3 for $20. There are so many better places in Vegas. If you have to try out the hot chocolate, go for it. Do not get any food though. So overpriced and so unsatisfying. We got wings, beef ribs, and two frozen hot chocolate for two and it was $80 after tax and tip. Oh hell no. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Let's start with the good, since it won't take me long to cover that part. The decor is definitely attractive and will peak your curiosity. Looks like a trendy new spot to stop by and hang out by the bar, or give a go at authentic British cuisine. And we're done with the good. Now let's go into why I felt like I wasted a perfect meal-time (i hate it when that happens...) at Gordon Ramsay's new restaurant. I literally ate like a rabbit all day just to save my stomach for Gordon Ramsay's. I mean, it's GORDON RAMSAY. The chef who is so angry and critical all the time, that I feel like his restaurant HAS to be good. I was so hungry that any mediocre dish (even fast food) could probably satisfy me, but Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill wasn't even close. For someone who markets himself as being a perfectionist in the kitchen, it certainly does not seem he has met his own standards. I started with the Fried Oysters appetizer. The dish was presented with three oyster shells with two tiny fried bits in each. I literally felt like I was just eating batter. Wasn't much flavoring to it and wasn't anything special. I followed it with the fish and chips. It wasn't terrible, but I feel like I could've probably found the same level of satisfaction at Long John Silver's. I would honestly rather make a stop at Long John's than pay $26 for that plate again. My date ordered the Braised Pork Belly ($30) and looked like it would be promising, but again, it was rather bland. You can definitely find a much better prepared pork belly elsewhere. The most exciting part was probably the pretzels as the form of complimentary bread. It was offered with butter and a type of cheese-mustard. I've heard good things about the pudding dessert and that's probably the only thing that would ever weigh my consideration on returning. My bill ended up being $100, 1 appetizer, 2 main course dishes, and 1 glass of Hennesey. Sadly, I would've been much happier spending that $100 at the Bacchanal Buffet. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I see a lot of people comparing shake shack to in n out and I'll be straight up about that in n out is still Better. Haha you could never compare the almighty in n out to anything. As far as Shake shack, the food reminded me of a Wendy's bacon burger but bigger non squar patties and better taste. Only thing that made it different was the cherry peppers and sauce. But watch if u think you'll be like damn this guy is right. I had smoke shack double and fries and wasn't full after, Im literally going order more food bc I wasn't that impressed. Heard so much hype about this spot but it was nothing orgasmic or like made me wanna react like this a miracle of a burger. Mind you this based on what I ate. I didn't try any desserts or anything else. The pricing is way overpriced probably because it's founded in New York. I'm west coast born and raised so I'll always be biast. If I visited New York again I would not go out of my way to go to shake shack, I bet no one has said that yet... That alone should change ur mind. This is suppose to be a New York staple and it was whatever. I spent 15 dollars on a burger, fries, and drinks that alone ruined my appetite. Pricing is mayb more then New York to bc its on the strip. Who knows ..the pricing sucked for what your getting. Don't get me wrong the burger was a bomb ass burger cooked medium well...but damn 9.49 for a double burger...2.95 for freezer fries..2.25 for reg soda that was the size of a water cup.I thought this was suppose to be fast food not a restaurant I don't know what it was but mayb I should of asked for sauces on the side to dip in or customize my burger... Something to make me feel like I didn't get ripped off......... Well round two let's see what's up. Hopefully this time it redeems my first experience. Ok round two was ten times better then my first round. Get the shack stack and a concrete and don't mess with anything else. That burger alone did it for me. Might be one of the best burgers I've ever had tell u the truth. So if your a shroom lover its on ",0,0,1,0,0

 Hotel is good, clean, and has an inviting atmosphere. It doesn't smell as bad as the other Hotels. There was no robes in the room I stayed in, which was disappointing, but room service cleaned up really good after leaving a generous tip on the table with a friendly note. I had to choose between a 3 and 4, so I decided 4 because of the smell and general atmosphere. It did not seem as scummy as some hotels I have seen on the strip. Mandalay Bay ""The Hotel"", which is an upgrade seemed to have a super clean and modern look however, I decided with the bigger room at Mandalay. I enjoyed the live entertainment and casino tables.

 Stay away from here. We moved in with promises of a 'family' community and how great it was. The day we moved in the neighbors upstairs had their music so loud we could hear the lyrics and the lyrics were all bad words and this ended up going on all the time. There was mold in the refrigerator, pee all over the carpet and bathroom floors, the appliances were so old they barely worked and the carpets had not been cleaned. It only got worse from there. It turns out the neighbors upstairs were drug dealers and the guy next to them was a pimp. Strange people, including strung out slutty looking girls, coming and going all night long. We have a toddler and were scared all the time. We complained but we were told we could leave and we did right away. It appears they would rather have illegal activities going on in their complex than a nice family. The maintenance is also a joke. We scheduled a 3 hour block of time for maintenance to come and fix a few things that should have been done before we moved in. We waited and waited and they never showed up. When I called I was told they were busy. The neighborhood is scary. I had a crack addict come up to me and my kid in broad daylight screaming for a nickel or a dime. STAY AWAY! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Great concept (I love Mongolian grills in general) but it was kind of expensive for the quality. The rice was overcooked, the fish I chose tasted odd and they don't clean off the grill between cooking so my roommate's food tasted fishy even though she had beef.

 Came here this past weekend for my sister in law's bachelorette. I know hotel spa's are expensive, but wowee.... this was the most expensive manicure I've ever had. Reason being..... you cannot use the Spa itself if you don't spend a minimum of $60. The girls were spending the morning at the spa, so what could I do? I had to upgrade my manicure from a $45 purchase to a $60! To me, I think if you're doing any sort of spa service, you should be able to take advantage of the spa amenities. Truly, they didn't offer anything ridiculous - hot tubs, cold plunge pool, and showers. I had to spend $25 for that? The service itself was wonderful. Linda gave me the best manicure I've had. The polish has only chipped a little bit and it's been 5 days. She didn't rush and was thorough. I'd pay $45 for the service again (with Linda) but not the extra to use a shower. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Not sure how the heck this place is still open! I suppose if it weren't for Macy's, Best Buy, Dicks, and (I hate to say it but) Sears this place would have been long gone. There are several vacant retail stores that are poorly disguised. One of the vacant areas they actually turned into a lounge which I suppose is okay but to me that beckons for teenage trouble. The food court is even more insufferable since Chick-Fil-A left. I used to love this mall, I literally hate to see the life being sucked out of this Mesa landmark. For my bargain hunters you will love getting lost in the Dillard's Clearance store. Really kid friendly mall with a nice size play area and train.

 One fine August day, a couple friends and I were walking down Ste. Cathrine looking for something to do. What appeared to be tour buses and metal roadies behind a large run down brick building were exactly that. We went over, asked them who was playing and were astonished. It was Necrophagist, Into Eternity and a host of others on the Canadian Summer Slaughter Tour (2008). Tickets were only $25, so we bought 5 for all of us. The place wasn't overly huge but the perfect size for a metal show. The moshes were unlike anything around the Boston area, much more intense, more people and throughout the whole song. Luckily, this is Montreal so everyone was like child size to me! All in all, I plan on coming back here, and planning a vacation around a metal concert if possible! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Whiskey Warehouse has a gorgeous interior, a great concept, but terrible food and service, and management that just doesn't seem to care. I went in with a group of friends for lunch at 11am on a Saturday- we were the only customers in the place. It took over an hour for us to receive our food. At least 12 people who came in after us (and two who even came in after we ordered) received their food before we did. Despite numerous inquiries, we didn't even get an apology out of the server or management. I'd eaten there once before and the shrimp kabob had been pretty decent, but the turkey burger several of us got was dry and tasteless, and they served me a side of chopped onions and peppers as the ""vegetable of the day"". Onions and peppers are what you cook vegetables in! Others in our party received their food cold, ironic after how long we waited. There are just too many good restaurants in the area for me to EVER go back there again. Sticking with Thomas St Tavern from now on! ",1,0,0,0,0

 yeah, this is the place where pseudo sushi afficienandos go to feel like their really exotic food experts. if it's got cream cheese in it, it ain't sushi, and this place has cc is just about every roll. happy hour is LOUD in the bar. not fun loud, but ""let's crank the bad early 90s alt rock and top 40 emo rock as loud as possible"" seemingly as catch all for the only demographics who will like this place- early 20s and late 40s and 50s who want to seem like they still know how to get down with the younger generation. because it's ahwatukee (a ""sleepy bedroom"" community that is pretty affluent all in all and likes to be reminded), the crowd can be obnoxious, even more than this bar already is. again, i recommend it as a place to go and be rowdy, not to eat great sushi.

 I don't know if I can ever bring myself to go back to this place. I had to pick up some supplies the other day for some ongoing health issues I've been having. I'd only ever been into the store once before, so I was just walking around trying to familiarize myself with everything so that I finally knew where to look for what I was looking for. At one point an employee walked up to me and said ""You have been here FOREVER!!!!"" (I'd really only been there for about 10 minutes, but maybe she could have said it like it wasn't an inconvenience that I'd been there for a few minutes.) I said ""I'm just looking for a few things and I don't really know what I'm looking for"". I had a list with me from my doctor, so I told the woman what my doctor had suggested. She asked me ""And what health problems are you having?"" ...That was a very personal question that if I hadn't been okay talking to another woman about, I would have just told her to mind her own business. ...But hoping that the more detail I gave her, the better she'd be able to help me, I told her what unpleasant things I had been experiencing. She then looked at me with a disgusted look. ...Great, exactly what I was hoping she WOULDN'T do. She started handing me all these vitamins and supplements... that were not what my doctor was telling me about. So I said ""I'm just looking for these few things"" and she said ""Well it looks like this is the aisle you want to be in. Here's another supplement"" as she handed me yet another bottle. I said ""What does this do?"" and she said ""I don't know, but it's the berry from the same tree as that thing in your hand that your doctor suggested. I don't even know what that's for."" I thanked her, told her I found what I was looking for, and when she left me, I put literally everything back that she had handed me because there was no way I was going to buy all this unwanted/unneeded crap. As it was, I walked out of there after spending $100. I know vitamin shops can be expensive, but if I'm going to spend $100 on herbal remedies, they should at least pretend like my health problems aren't totally disgusting. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My fellow Yelpers and coworkers have attracted my attention to Honey Salt, the husband and I have been wanting to try it since. Dinner started at 5pm so we arrived at that time, so we thought. The young but nice hostess informed us that we were 4 minutes early so we would have to wait to be seated. ummmm k. We had a drink at the ever welcoming bar (great 4 minute early service). 20 min later we re-approached the hostess who sat us, the place was still rather empty. Bread and bean dip- divine. Ceaser- to die for. Chicken- amazing, juicy and crispy....How? Salmon- came super raw- like seared on one side for a few seconds raw, I showed the waiter (super amazing guy) I figured that is how the chef prepared the salmon. He said no, that it was raw and took it back. No worries, I sipped my wine and enjoyed the great scene. The manager brought the salmon back (over $20 plate)- same piece and seriously black- they just threw the same salmon on the grill and cooked the heck out of it, like it was some backyard barbecue! Seeing how it looked like a cat got at it I told the manager this won't do, just cancel the order. He returned a short time later and said the chef was sorry, that he is making a new plate. The manager was so sweet I didn't want to argue, he said he just wanted me to leave happy. YAY for customer service. The second salmon was PERFECT- so yummy. Martinis are great too- Dessert was the BEST I have ever had (pumpkin cheesecake), like a delicious cloud in your mouth good. I can see how people don't agree with the price to food ratio- we left satisfied but not overfilled, we think it was because it was healthy food. Also, one yelper wrote about the tap water, I gotta agree, it has a weird taste! Drink the wine :) Although the night started out rocky (even the husband said ""lets leave and go to Vintners"") I have to say the awesome managers/waiter action in making it right said a lot, got the 4 stars, and got us to return again.

 This is my second time here. And to be honest, the food here is decent but not amazing. My first time was for the happy hour, and the second time was for the reverse happy hour. We always get the 3 rolls and 1 drink on the HH menu. This time round, we got the sunset roll for the special roll, and the spicy salmon and salmon skin standard rolls. The sunset roll was really good, it's basically salmon roll with tuna added on top (I hope my memory serves me correct on this one!) and I really enjoyed it. I remember liking it a lot because it wasn't fried, has no cream cheese in it and wasn't baked. I can't really get around the idea of baked sushi to be honest, and it's just too weird a concept for me. Maybe I'll get one of their baked rolls the next time. Spicy salmon was pretty standard. I didn't really like the salmon skin roll too much- it was a little overcooked and I had a hard time biting through the salmon skin, it's too crispy and hard. Oh, and we also got an edamame as our yelp check-in deal. That was pretty nice. Service was pretty attentive. Our server is the same petite, friendly asian lady that we had the last time. This time round though, she did try to sell us seltzer water and asked us a little too many times if we wanted to order more. Once or twice is okay, but I always felt that if you asked me like 3-4 times if I want more food, it does turn me off a little. Good thing she always ask with a smile, and I suppose she is after all, doing her job. I'll probably be back just for the happy hour. To be honest, I kinda hope they condense the menu a little- all the fancy names for the rolls get me really confused, and I take a longer time trying to process through the menu. Not a good thing if they want to increase their turnover. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Over the last few months we have bought several thousand dollars in furniture for our new home. We have been in Vegas for 30+ yrs. we have never had a problem with this store. Just tell the sales people you just want to look around. They will leave you alone & occasionally check to see if you need any help. The selection is huge. We had a lovely sales lady, Maggie. She went out of her way to accommodate us. No pressure to buy. The delivery service was premo. Always called before & showed up on time. We bought a large sectional & decided the wedge was too large. We picked out some tables & they exchanged it the next day. A bedroom set we bought 2 wks ago was shown in an ad yesterday. I called Maggie, & she and her manager made it right. No questions asked.

 So it helps when you visit this place and get seated in the main section. The last time we were here we sat in the bar, and everything was fine. This time we came in with some friends, and sat in the main area. We were greeted promptly by the friendly staff. I have to give some credit to our waitress as our group had two english only speakers, one spanish only speaker, someone who was bilingual and a child. Our waitress was able to easily switch back and forth between english and spanish to assist us. The salsa has definitely improved since our last visit. The medium was really chunky and the mild had much more flavor. The chips really are incredible here...probably the best I've had it town. Very crunchy, a bit oily but they are also very large. I had the taco salad. Its more of a hard shelled burrito than a salad. There is lettuce, but there are more beans and cheese than lettuce. The salad also has guacamole, salsa, sour cream and olives. I had without the meat, but you can get the meat on it. The portion was huge. After indulging in chips and salsa, I maybe conquered half of it. This place does have a roving magician/balloon animal artist. He was a little less aggressive than others I've seen, which was nice. We definitely had a better experience, and will probably be back.

 I went in one night a couple months ago and I haven't been back since.There was live music, which would have been cool but the band was horrible and way too loud. my server was an asshole and it took 15 minutes for her to even greet us, and even longer for her to come back with our drinks. The place was a cluster fuck and the owner was behind the bar drinking (which I'm pretty sure is illegal) and I'm pretty sure him behind the bar (making his own drinks and yelling at everyone) had something to do with the slow delivery of our drinks. The highlight of the night was seeing that same owner get into a physical fight with a female customer that was sitting at the bar, and being questioned by the police about it as we left,which was a total buzz kill. All I can say is stay away, these people have no idea how to run a business and have no idea what customer service is. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Well, there were some good points and some not so good. I gave it a 2 because the whole description is what it felt like-Meh. I had heard some good things about Match. Reviews from actual food critics. (whom I am not sure I trust so much right now). So I might have had kinda high expectations going in. It was a Tues. night, 9pm and we were the only diners. Not the best sign. We started with cocktails. I ordered a Suspicious Minds-a ginger version of the cosmopolitan and it was drinkable although a bit dry. My husband ordered the Aloha (something) which was made with pineapple flavored vodka. Think artificial pineapple candy flavored with rubbing alcohol. Not very good. He could barely finish it and went for the Kiwi Caipiroska..due to actual muddled fruit, it was sour but better than his previous drink. I wouldn't even suggest a cocktail menu any more if you aren't going to use real fruit, real juice, and infused rather than flavored alcohols. I like that each food item has the country of origin printed next to it. Kind of makes you feel like you are eating around the world. They are open until 2am and that is a great idea for our side of town too. I guess when you are drunk the blandness of the food would be a good thing. The prices are very reasonable (not like SOME places in town) so we felt comfortable to get quite a variety of small plates. We started with the Sashimi Salad, Salt and Pepper Calamari, Belgium Frites, Dragon Balls, Tuna Poke and usually we would order more. Well, here's why we didn't. The Sashimi Salad had a decent amount of little pieces of sashimi and for the price I think it was justifiable. There was way too much vinegar-ey dressing on way too little greens. And the greens weren't really green but that horrible industrial iceberg lettuce mix a Walmart shopper adores. Greens are so inexpensive they could at least have given us a large portion to absorb all that vinegar. The Salt & Pepper Calamari was missing the salt and pepper. We actually really tried to find the pepper..maybe it was white pepper? But couldn't see any or taste it either. I have had this dish many times and usually you can actually taste the Salt and Pepper. The panko style breading was a good crispyness, the calamari a bit too chewy (it kept snapping back at me!) but it had about NO flavor. The Belgium Frites could have been Ore Ida. I had these in San Francisco and I wouldn't be surprised if these were frozen from the bag and barely fried. No salt to distract me here either. The sauce Andolouse (?) was supposed to be spicy and was about as flavorful as your basic mayo. Then the Dragon Balls. We have had these types of creations at some sushi bars so we KNOW that you CAN deep fry sushi and still have it be moist inside. These were not. They were fried so much on the outside they should be called Dragon Cannon Balls..and the spicy tuna inside was cooked so much that it didn't have any more flavor. Last but not least we tried the Tuna Poke..I guess it can be considered authentic because there was Tuna and sesame oil..but since tuna is so light in flavor, that much sesame oil can be over powering. I love sesame oil but really, a dish of it isn't that appealing. Being the food adventurers we are we were going to try dessert anyway. And here comes the best part of the meal. We ordered the Hawaiian dessert which was like a biscuit dough deep fried and rolled in sugar. The doughy balls had a lovely browned crispy outside with a tender light biscuit consistency inside. Served warm, the sugar covering the dough was moist and perfect. We also ordered the Frozen Coconut. This is a great coconut sorbet, not too sweet with a creamy (not like ice cream) texture. Served inside a halved coconut shell it was the perfect ending to a less than perfect meal. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Went in here because my mom is a Coke fanatic and the store is awesomely decorated, got some pretty cool memorabilia but I'm gonna be totally honest here, I'm just leaving a review because of the horrible service I got while paying for my things. Just a heads up guys, if you're gonna purchase things here, come with no expectations of good customer service, especially from this worker Desiree. My mom spent a good amount of money here and was even trying to be friendly to her but all she gets back is just a horrible attitude and rude replies. We asked for two separate orders and bags because one were for my uncle and she actually had the nerve to give us, the customer, an eye roll (LITERALLY) and gave us attitude while separating our things. About half an hour later my aunt also purchased things from another cashier, who was ALSO rude. I mean really? If you don't want to work then don't. My goodness people... ",0,0,1,0,0

 Where do I begin?? We came in since our favorite tapas place was closed do to a power outage and I had been wanting to try the place since they opened because I live across the street. We sat at the bar and I ordered a Bloody Mary and my girlfriend ordered a water, the bartender rolled her eyes when the water was ordered and carded me and not my girlfriend even though she was sitting at the bar and gambling and is clearly younger then me. We asked for a food menu and ordered the Mac n cheese with truffle, the ceviche, and the beef Wellington. We noticed a lot of spelling errors in the menu which made us veer away from those items, if you can't spell them then how good are you at making them. My girlfriend decided on a beer but we couldn't get the bartenders attention until she brought our food. The beer came quickly. There was no truffle taste to the Truffle Mac n cheese, the ceviche had barley any seafood and the smallest chip ""bowl"" known to man, it was just slightly bigger then a tostito's scoop. A few min later are beef Wellington came out over cooked. My roommate came in, sat next to us and asked for a menu. She decided on food and closed her menu, we decided on desert and closed ours. We waited ten min and I tried to get the bartenders attention but no help, they helped people near us but never came to us, they never even tried to make eye contact to see if we were ok. I took my tip back off the bar, since she never came by to pick it up anyway and went to complain to the ""guy in charge when the gm's away"" he was standing at the bar with his arm over two guys talking and completely ignoring everyone around him. I interrupted him and said I had heard him say earlier that he worked there, he was extremely rude and I walked away mid conversation. I will never return especially since there was a young boy about 4 years old running around in kitchen and service areas. Who let's a four year old into a bar let alone the kitchen?? A complete waste of $60 ($30 gambling and $30 on our bill) ",1,0,0,0,0

 We purchased a desktop approximately one month ago and this morning it would not turn on properly. Only a blue screen would come up and a message saying that it was trying to repair the issue. After a few hours of it pending we gave up. We took the desktop back to Best Buy. They told us that it was past the 14 day warranty, so they would ship it back to the manufacturer. This would take 2-4 weeks. Obviously we were upset, but what could we do? Once we were back at our office, we received the mail, and coincidentally there was a letter from Best Buy Geek Squad offering us a Black Tie Protection plan for either two or four years. I called both the store and the Geek Squad corporate office to see if purchasing this plan would still apply to us even though they already had our computer, and if it would expedite the issue. After a considerable wait time on both calls, The Geek Squad corporate office informed me that I was still able to purchase the protection plan, and it would most definitely expedite the return of my computer. The Best Buy store informed that I would be able to get my computer back after 2-4 days instead of 2-4 weeks. However, the Best Buy location could not sell me the service plan. I could only purchase it from Geek Squad corporate, so I called them back. After being placed on hold for approximately 27 minutes, they informed me that I could not purchase the plan at this time because my ""Access code was broken, and needed to be repaired"" and that ""There is no way to override the system error"" and that I'd have to wait 3-5 days in order for technical support to fix this error. I asked to speak to a manager, even though the customer service representative informed me that a manager would not be able to help me. I insisted that she find me a manager, and begged the manager to help me. He told me that there was nothing he could do, except to call me on Friday (5 days from today) to give me an update. I called the Best Buy location again, and spoke with Dani. She said that that there was nothing they could do, because they are not able to sell protection plans after 14 days (only corporate Geek Squad can offer this product). She informed me that I missed the warranty by only two days, because it was actually a 30 day warranty. I asked her if there was anything they can do to expedite repairing the computer and she told me it would take 3-4 weeks and that was the best they could do. I informed her that a few hours ago, someone told me it would take 2-4 weeks, and she said they were wrong. She put me on hold, and came back to tell me that the warranty was actually up after 14 days instead of thirty. She also informed me that they were wrong about it only taking 2-4 days for it to be fixed by Geek Squad, and that it would actually take about 3-4 weeks even if we did purchase the extra protection plan. I asked her, ""What was the point in purchasing it?"" She informed me that there really wasn't much point unless my warranty had expired. My original factory warranty is for one year. I expressed to her several times that I was very unhappy and begged her to help me in some way. She again told me that there was nothing she could do for me. I have never been told so many conflicting things, and been given such a complete run around by a company. It took me from about 1pm-4:30pm (not to mention the hour that we spent at the location earlier today) and we are not any closer to getting our computer back. I know this review is long, and if you skim to the bottom like I usually do... DO NOT PURCHASE COMPUTERS OR CELL PHONES FROM BEST BUY. They will treat you like crap. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The selection isn't great and the books aren't in great condition considering they're very overpriced. The paperbacks are half of the original cost, which wouldn't be terrible, except if the original cost is too cheap they cover it in sharpie and mark up the price. I bought a book as a gift for someone, only to find that they already had it. I called the store 10 minutes after leaving, after paying in cash, and they'll only issue store credit.

 I would recommend hitting this place early it can get pretty crowded at night but you can usually find a spot at the bar if you just want to grab some grub and a few pops. The staff is helpful and they will make any dish to your preference: allergic to dairy, no problems; don't like tomatoes, done. The name gives it away, the fish taco's are pretty darn delicious. The portion sizes are large and reasonably priced and with $2 longboards & tecates to wash it down, that's a pretty sweet deal. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I am giving Flamingo Palace 5 stars because they have the best food and service of any Chinese restaurant I've tried in Phoenix. I like Bamboo House and Superdragon, too, but this is by far my favorite. My in-laws are Chinese food experts. I never thought we could get them to like Chinese food in Phoenix as they are from New York, where good Chinese food lives. But they love Flamingo Palace. Every time they visit us, they ask to go there. I just had my book club there and they were so awesome! We had heaps of food and each was better than the next. Plus, the service was just amazing- this with 13 people in our group. I had such a pleasant, stress-free experience. They gladly substituted chicken for pork, and as other people have noted, their chicken is the good stuff. Also, they are very generous with shrimp, meat, etc. People in my group actually ordered alcoholic drinks from their ample drink menu, which I've never really noticed before. I'm not much of a drinker. But everyone really enjoyed the plum wine. It was pretty cool that they have some different things to offer than a lot of other Chinese restaurants. For example, try the house Flamingo chicken. It is so good. We wiped out their szechuan chicken, it was spicy and fantastic. I also highly recommend their pu pu platter and spicy shrimp. Yum!

 Wife and recently moved to the area and this was the first place we decided to try as aesthetically it jumped out and seemed fun. That much stayed true, the inside has a great vibe, not that large, and had a live musician playing in a little balcony overlooking the restaurant. Beyond that the experience was the exact 2-Star definition of 'Meh. I've had better'. It took us almost 30 minutes to get seated, and we were hardly even acknowledged by the wait staff. After being seated drinks took another 15 minutes, and food order was another 20 minutes, and 15+ minutes more before the appetizer came out. Speaking of which, the Queso Fundito was the one thing highly raved about here, yet, ours came out as a luke-warm solid mass of cheese--not the dip-able queso we anticipated. In all, from the time we arrived to the time we left took nearly 2 hours. The entrees were ok, I don't really have complaints there other than it may be a bit pricey for what it was (except my wife's burrito, it was huge and only like $8). However, it's likely nothing impressed me because of how irritated I was with how long everything was taking. Our server (maybe she was a manager?) was trying really hard and did apologize for the wait on everything. She did mention that there was a party of 20 in there which led to the delays. While I can empathize with this, it didn't seem as if this party put the restaurant over capacity of what a busy friday night might normally be, so they should have been staffed accordingly, not to mention we were sat well after they were so the food orders were plenty staggered. \ \ Maybe I'll try it again and see if it goes better, we'll see.

 Drunk and Hungry from Colorado. My friend and I stumbled into this Greek place after a night of drinking, and they didn't disappoint. They recommended the chicken gyro, and it was delicious! We went back the next night, and they gave us a free gyro because they remembered us (probably not the norm)! The seating in the restaurant is the only bad part, not enough, and uncomfortable.

 Full Disclosure: I was fired today from Mountain View Coffee. As an employee? Nope, as a near daily, year-long customer who dropped $7-$10 per day and always tipped - interesting, huh? I'll nevertheless attempt to be balanced here. Pros: Charming, cozy surroundings, good espresso, a few very tasty home-baked items made by personable, hardworking young staff members. Male co-owner also unfailingly friendly, great with customers and staff. Cons: Food overpriced - particularly the baked goods from Costco. Lunch sandwiches made from scratch but overpriced ($7.25 for egg salad, really?) Worst Con: Female owner with astonishingly bad attitude. Openly chastises her employees, is suspicious of customers, incredibly stingy, and, as another patron observed, creates an ""unpleasant, negative atmosphere."" Why was I fired? For having the temerity to complain. This woman appears to dislike feedback of any kind, but an actual complaint sends her reeling. One day recently when I mentioned my ""loyalty card"" (buy 10, get one free) had not been stamped earlier, she gave me a distinct ""you're lying"" look. I asked to speak with her today and explained hat her reaction of mistrust offended me. When I further observed that she seemed to trust no one, her response was, ""I don't"". Wow! Great attitude for a down-home coffee shop owner. Bottom line - nice place, but keep any observations, complaints or even constructive feedback or suggestions to yourself. And whatever you do, don't ask for your loyalty card to be stamped. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I LOVE LOVE LOVE seafood, and I love Rick Moonen. I had the pleasure of meeting him up in Napa when he was doing a food demonstration with Michael Chiarello at Napa Style. They both were really down to earth chefs, and Rick Moonen definitely loves and knows his food. We were hoping that he was going to be at the restaurant, but we had missed him by ONE day. He flew out to NY the day we were there. But the meal still blew me away (with or without Chef Moonen's presence, although that would have been icing on the cake) We had the five course meal and the three course meal and shared all the courses. The service was really impeccable (our server was just ok, but everyone else were top notch). First, we started with a salad of burrata, braised tomato vinagrette, lobster tail, and squash blossom tempura. OMG holy cow. The burrata was light and melted in your mouth. The sweetness and the acidity of the tomato vinagrette helped cut through the creaminess of the burrata. The squash blossom tempura was surprisingly super crunchy and added a wonderful textural component. How if that wasn't enough, there was a tender piece of lobster tail sitting in the middle of the plate waiting to be devoured. Very good portion. Exquisite. Sweet Corn Soup with Fresh Blue Crab: The soup captured the very essence of the sweet corn. It was light, but had a touch of cream to it. I liked the flavor a lot and the soup was not too overpowering as to mute the flavor of the sweet crab. The portion was smaller, but I thought it was just the right amount because I could see the flavor getting a bit monotonous if one consumed too much. All in all- a very good soup. Rick Moonen's Clam chowder- I am lactose intolerant, but this soup was so addicting, and so hearty. I wish I could have had more than a few bites, because it was so delicious. The soup had a smoky flavor to it from either bacon or a ham hock. There was a generous amount of clams (you know they were freshly shucked) and fresh potatoes and your typical mirepoix . Again, very hearty and all in all a very good soup. Also a really good portion. Seared scallop with hot and sour sauce over seared eggplant: The scallop had a nice sear on both sides and was presented over a seared eggplant. I like all of the things seperately, but I thought the sauce, although delicious, overpowered the sweetness of the scallop. However, the sauce went perfectly with the eggplant, and it was actually my favorite part of the dish. Ciopinno- solid ciopinno with fresh seafood, al dente pasta, served with garlic bread. The ciopinno had crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, and fresh fish. I like a little spice to my ciopinno, but this was definitely legit. 9 oz filet with whipped potatoes and red wine reduction- Good cut of meat, legit potatoes, and the wine reduction was a good accompaniment. My only complaint was that they overcooked the filet just a little, but I'm assuming that's just how its prepared by the chef, because we never specified how we wanted the filet cooked. Rocky Road- chocolate pudding, homemade marshmallows, candied peanuts, vanilla ice cream, brownie bits, and a drizzle of passion fruit syrup. It sounds weird but it all worked together. The saltiness and the crunch of the peanuts worked well with all the other sweet components tot he dish I liked it. Fat Elvis: Fried spring rolls with a banana, peanutbutter, and chocolate filling, then rolled in cinnamon sugar with a passion fruit dipping sauce. It sounds weird, but it was actually pretty good. I hate bananas so I had to take the banana out. It was ooey and gooey and at the same time crunchy from the wrapper. I especially liked it with the passionfruit. All in all, I was satisfied with the meal. I was surprised with the portion size, and I was stuffed at the end of the meal. I would definitely go back. The five course was $75, and the 3 course was $55 (add $15 for the filet) Can't wait to come back! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Thai restaurant? Y'all already know what your girl, Angela ordered. (Pad Thai, of course!) For it being on the Lunch Special menu, it was pretty pricey. $9.99 for a decent portion + choice of soup or salad. I chose and loved the soup, it had a strong ginger taste, and I love me some ginger! Given it's Scottsdale, where I assume food is a little bit pricier, I won't dwell on the $9.99. But I can honestly say, that the Pad Thai (with shrimp and chicken) was super dry. You could see the clumpy paste of a sauce they put on the dish, and the chicken, yikes! Very, Very dry. The flavoring was fine, but just toooooooooo dry! I wanted to pour water over the noodles! Towards the end, I was dipping my chicken into my friend's curry as an attempt to soften up the chicken, but it didn't work :( ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is great if you have been out all night and want some ""drunk food"". On weekends roughly 11pm this place gets packed. Expect to wait at least 45-60 minutes to get a slice. If you want to order a whole pizza I would recommend calling ahead(if they even pick up), it's about an hour wait if you call in. If you are in line waiting for a slice but decide to get a whole pizza instead, its about 20-30 minutes for a whole pizza, depending how busy it is. It can be a little pricey, but it's Vegas, almost everything is overpriced. If you don't mind dishing out $5 a slice, or $6 with a drink, you should definitely make your way over here. I would recommend getting the white pizza. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Dined here on a Sunday night with another couple and requested to sit outside. The restaurant is very beautiful and so is the scenery (waterfall) Since we had a big lunch, we decided to order an appetizers and entr \ u00e9e to share. For the four of us. We ordered the following: 1/2 dozen oysters Crab cake-1 piece LOL Yellowtail Carpaccio 1 Steak 2-glasses of wine And a BIG FAT CHECK $500+ Um....this may sound like a lot of food but not if you saw the portions. TINY!!! Crab cake did not go around since it wasn't even enough for 1 person rather than 4 people. We asked for the steak to be medium and it came out EXTRA CRISPY with a side of charcoal flavor. We sent it back and it took another 25 minutes for a new one to come out. During dinner, the lake that has the waterfall would put on small shows with random artistic pictures, dancing with balls, etc.. you have to see it to know what I'm talking about.

 I want to make it clear at the beginning of the review that the two star rating isn't because of service; I like when the waiter/waitress are able to cut loose and have fun with the table of guest.

 Okay, so I know the rule about eating seafood when you're not near the ocean. And I should've followed that rule. I ordered the lobster bisque because a yelper said there were chunks of lobster, and so did our waiter, Bryce. It sucked balls. There were no mentionings about having pieces of ravioli with what tasted like cheese. The soup base was good, yet it would've been better if it was a bit warmer. (I totally understand liability issues and tourists suing for hot beverages and soups), but both my soup and husband's were a bit on the cold side. Not enjoyable. Oh, and he ordered the Tuscan white bean soup and asked for sour cream on the side, they came back saying they don't put sour cream in their soups. Uhhhh, does it matter!? Shit, my husband's Romanian and his people put sour cream on EVERY soups! Onto our entrees, I ordered the seafood pasta with linguini. Pasta was aldent \ u00e9, sauce was blehhhh....seafood, well lets just say I had a few rotten tasting pieces of mussels, there were also some JUMBO ass shrimps that was overcooked and the clams were okay. Hubby ordered something with chicken...blah blah idk I was much more concerned about the bad mussel taste in my mouth. Okay, Bryce our waiter. I understand waiters have to be a little fake but your personality was flat out like a piece of rock. I didn't appreciate the fact that you and that haggard blonde hostess were making fun of the old man coming in to have dinner by himself. *snicker snicker* was all I heard you two. You suck Bryce. I don't really like your face either. Please do not send your guy that sweeps the floors to sweep around people who are eating!! Worst organization skills here!

 itching to get into a fight? do you want to start off your day in a bad mood? if so start your day off at raffles!!! SERIOUSLY. this is the worst service i've EVER had in my life and i've had some shitty service. ok let me start from the beginning, i've been wanting to eat here a handful of times but never got to it and finally on our last morning and i decided to eat here before we checked out. we got seated around 10:30 AM..usually i get my drink order within 5 minutes but no...it took almost 20 minutes for our waitress, stacyann (BEWARE IF SHE IS YOUR WAITRESS ASK FOR ANOTHER ONE OR LEAVE) to come for our drink orders i ordered cranberry and my friend ordered coffee..and she was about to leave and i told her we wanted to order and she gave the ""my shit don't stink face"" and said uhm ok. i ordered the open face turkey sandwich, something that my mama loved and really hard to find, and my friend go the french toast. we got our drinks within 5 minutes and during that time i read the quick tip about stacyann being horrible...great just my luck, but i wanted a good last meal in vegas so i brushed it off. i got my cranberry juice and i was thirsty so i took a BIG gulp and almost spit it out. it was DISGUSTING it was watered down had some sort of carbonation and a slight hint of cranberry. i asked for another one and once again she gave me the ""my shit don't stink face"" UGH she brought it out and this one was good, but i started to feel sick like i drank someones leftover cranberry juice. anyways i drank that down to get that nasty taste out of my mouth and i asked for a refill (ok hint i said REFILL) she said that there was no more cranberry juice but that i can have OJ. i said whatever and she brought it out w/ the food 30 MINUTES LATER i was REALLY upset and wanted to eat and leave so my BF asked for the check right away and it took her 40 MINUTES TO GET THE CHECK WTF!!!!!!!!!!! ugh and when we got the check she charged me for the cranberry juice and the OJ and when i told her why she said juices aren't refillable. WHY COULDN'T SHE SAY THAT EARLIER? and really w/ that NASTY cranberry shouldn't she have not even charged us? UGH we just paid and left and gave her a big fat 0 tip. honestly she shouldn't be a waitress esp at a las vegas hotel. she put us in such a bad mood for the next couple of hours. i will NEVER come back even though the food was decent. management should realize who they hire and should REGULATE if service is THAT bad ",1,0,0,0,0

 Don't piss on my head and tell me it's raining. Preface. I could not wait to try Foskoskies, two separate friends told me I had to go try it.

I order a glass of Prosseco and I tell the server if it isn't fresh, I will take the Sauvignon Blanc. Simple. She serves me flat prosseco and tells me it's a new bottle. Really? And then she got pissy because I didn't drink it and asked her to take it off the check. I will post the photo of my sparkling it looks like still wine in a Champagne flute. It's kind of funny now. On a lighter note, I ordered a burger and fries and the fries came out piping hot. That settled me down for a moment.

When I am in the area I like to drop in and get a coffee. I like Starbucks but sometimes it is too much, it sort of reminds me of the Target of coffee shops. I like Sambalatte because it is pure coffee shop without all the cross marketing and the interior makes a person want to sit down a bit and relax. This of course is the point. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Love this place! Came here while out here for Giants spring training, . Great HH, must have their margaritas. Don't be surprised by the small glass because they do their job. Ordered the sliders, dirty fries (wish I got a pic of it! it's topped with 2 eggs), jalapeno mac n cheese, and their gigantic cinnamon roll that the 3 of us didn't even finish. It was more of a spur of the drunk moment order. This place is a must if you're in the area. Definitely going back on future trips! ",0,0,0,0,1

 If you have PCOS please DO NOT GO HERE! I had Dr. Kneesel and my first appointment went as normal. Months later after I got married my husband and I wanted to start a family. Six months later I was still having trouble trying to conceive. I researched on my own and learned about PCOS. I went back to my doctor and let her know what was going on and to test for PCOS. After an ultrasound and blood test it was confirmed and she placed me on Metformin. She asked for me to make an appointment 3 months later to check up on me. I did as she asked and when I went in for the appointment she blasted me saying that Metformin isn't a miracle pill and that I was wasting her time. (Sorry but YOU were the one who asked ME to make this appointment!) She then went on to say that she was FARRRRR too busy to deal with someone like me because she had WAYYYY too many patients already. Needless to say I never returned because of her extreme unprofessional demeanor. AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!! They're probably too busy to see you anyway. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Friendly folks, reasonable prices, and a decent selection are the highlights of this Chinese Bakery. It actually has a welcoming vibe (very rare for your hole-in-the-wall Chinese Bakeries!) but the reason I don't rate this higher is because I wasn't overly impressed with the quantity or quality of the ingredients within most of the buns. For the custard bun, the bun was gigantic but the custard was smaller than a penny in diameter. It was not well-balanced. For the pork bun/turnover, I felt the same way-- very little in the way of filling. It was unfortunate, because I thought they could be my go-to bakery, but alas, my hunt goes on... ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've lived in Vegas for a year now, and just down the street is quite a few restaurants that I've been wanting to try. Barcelona Tapas & Bar is one of them. Finally last night my husband and I decided to go and try it before our move to London next month. I was not impressed! The only thing good about this place was our server. A very tall and handsome guy with a lot of enthusiasm! I believe he may of been the owner. When we walked in the ambiance of the place was just 'Meh' and it took a few moments before anyone even acknowledged that we were even there. Our table was at one of the bar 'booths' which was uncomfortable and the table was so short that we couldn't even cross our legs. We had to sit next to each other, not across from each other, because one side of the booth was a booth like seat and the other side of the table were these short little bar type stools with no backs. Very uncomfortable! The food was OK, not wonderful, but just OK. Although I must say that the Pan Fried Dates................................$ 5.50 (Pitted dates stuffed with almonds wrapped in bacon with merlot reduction and sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles.) were VERY yummy!! But everything else, I'm sorry to say, was just not very good. I've had better! The House Made Sangria was delicious though! I would recommend a pitcher of that any time. Half off pitchers and certain foods are at Happy Hour (Monday-Friday's from 4pm-7pm). So I'm sorry to say that I'm only giving this place a 2 star rating because I agree that it is just that; Meh. I've experienced better! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I am giving this place 1 extra star since I love the sauce that they sell at stores for enchiladas. So I decided to go here and give the real thing a try. Man was I surprised....they dont even use their own sauce they sell. The sauce that landed on my tongue was gross, I tried to start over in my head thinking maybe I was expecting to much but the meat inside was not any better. To top all this off the sewer was over flowing outside and was stinking up the night air. Even though my wife said she liked what she ate this is my review and I would never return. Learn from this review and use the sauce that you sell at Walmart and things will start to get better. ",0,1,0,0,0

 If this is how Chef Simon had worked on Iron Chef, Cat Cora would have kicked his ass! The food came out 45 minutes after order (""30 Minute Lunch"" - BS!). The food was overcooked and the waiter did not come back to ask us anything after it was served (he came by at the end to give us the check). Had to ask for most things twice (sugar for tea, mustard, straws). Does the Chef not care that he has such crappy service??! There are so many other places to eat in Vegas, one would think that Simon does not want to be one of the crappy places (wait, too late..). ",0,1,0,0,0

 Overpriced bad food. I had the pleasure of coordinatiing the office xmas party as did every year. The firm decided to take the staff and their spouses to LV for the weekend. I decided to book the dinner party at Joe's. The photos on the website is oh so mouth-watering. Everyone couldn't wait to taste the food. We decided on a pre-fix menu. Course 1: The 2nd Mortgage It's probably the best course, but it was just so so. It was a medley of 2 inch king crab legs, 1 jumbo shrimp, half of a very small lobster, and a ceviche of shrimp and scaIlop. I am used to having at least 3 sauces with my seafood medley. it came with just cocktail sauce. Course 2: Vegetable Chopped Salad A mix of celery, lettuce, cheese..... it was flavorless. Course 3: filet mignon My was medium rare and hers was medium. I came close to choking to death on the first bite bc it was so dry. I decided to cut down the center and saw that it was red and not overcooked. I started eating it from the inside. It was dry and powdery with no beef flavor. I left a third of it bc I couldn't take it anymore. Her steak was dry and she left half uneaten. The sides were mash and grille tomatos. Both were mediocre. Course 4: Dessert After all that, I decided to play safe. I got the chocolate fudge pie. You can't go wrong with chocolate. With that said, it was nothing to write home about. She got the banana cream pie. That was just okay. I would not go here again. I discourage anyone to go there. At close to 80 bucks per person(food only), I can eat a lot better than that. I was so very disappointed. The staff will have to wait a year for me to make up to them. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in April 2013 and it was reasonably priced and in a great location on the strip. We booked online and then were able to upgrade to a GO room for $20 extra per night so thats what we did. There was a very long line at check in but I noticed the kiosks available for us to do check in. That worked great and Greg ( awesome employee at Flamingo) assisted us and we got our room in 5 minutes! Greg was a great help and very personable! We got strip view however we coule hear music till 4 am on Fri and Sat night. The music is from Harrahs Carnival Court and very loud even on the 21st floor. The rooms were somewhat updated. There was even a tv in the bathroom mirror. Overall a good experience. Negatives- elevators take forever and the doors close quickly time share people are very annoying and bother you when you get on/ off the elevators strip view rooms are super loud till 4 am on weekends Positives- location is great buffet is good and you can watch the flamingoes while you eat nice pool- gets crowded- chairs fill up fast affordable maids let you sleep in Greeg- he is in the lobby and very helpful ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have a shopping problem and Nordstrom Rack certainly doesn't help with that. I really love this store, it has everything you could ever want, but at prices that won't make you stay away like that floor at Nordstrom that you know better than to go on. You KNOW which one I'm talking about. I have found some awesome stuff here, from hair product to coats to make up to designer jeans. I have found designer shoes for practically nothing and super in style! I really love that they keep the selection up and their sales are generally massive. The reason I gave this store only three stars is because the last time I was in there I happened to take my stuff to a little counter that sits amongst the racks to make it more convenient for those paying with credit cards. As I'm there the guy can't scan some hair product so I offer to go grab another one while he finishes ringing up my other things. When I come back there's this obnoxiously rude blonde girl ringing up someone else and practically pushing me out of the way. She would NOT move. While my stuff was on the counter. Being rung up. Before she ever got there. I was fuming. She was so up in my purchase that the guy ringing me up forgot to take a safety tag off as skirt so of course the alarm goes off. Thanks, rude girl. Anyway, I love this store, but you sometimes have to search for really good deals and then there's the rude blonde chick. Other than that it's a super sweet indulgence! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Tried a new place for breakfast, Mimi's in Scottsdale. Won't go there again. Food took forever to arrive. I asked waitress for extra butter, she gave me a reason why i didn't need extra butter, i said i wanted it anyways. She brought the butter after 1/2 my pancakes were gone. Waitress never checked back to see how everything was, which should be done 1/3 of the way through the meal, i was a restaurant manager and chef for 32 years. Then, i had to ask for my check, and was detained another 5-7 minutes before i received that. Once was enough for me, obviously poor managment and training. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was not impressed with this convention center at all. I was there for a 10,000 or so person convention. There is no where near enough food to feed the people that fit in this building. The lines for the over priced bland food were so long! I do not want to spend my convention time standing in line for food. The layout to get to the different rooms is weird. There are two seperate areas for the convention which includes lots of walking to get from one to another. Its nice that it connects to the hotel, but its way at the end of the strip for people staying in other hotels. Would not recommend. ",0,1,0,0,0

They bring the salad cart over to the table so that they can make it right in front of you. Raspberry sorbet is served between dishes to cleanse the palate. This restaurant is in a class of it's own.

 6pm on a Thursday night and we are seated and it takes over ten minutes until anyone even looks at us. Some busboy finally asks if anyone has helped us...and offered to get some water and iced tea. So...not off to the best start. When a waiter finally comes to talk to us we tell him we are ready to order...then he starts in explaining everything we don't care about and don't want or need to hear. Then he apologizes saying they were having a shift change...really?! Right in the middle of dinner rush hour...whatever. So we order the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer, fish tacos, Salmon and a Caesar salad. The appetizer shows up very quickly...and was pretty good...breaded deep fried shrimp in some type of good sauce. About ten minutes pass and...the main courses arrive. I casually mention that my salad never came and to please make sure I'm not charged for it. Still not improving. The tacos were good and served hot. The Salmon was okay and served hot. Frankly for a fresh fish house I was really expecting the salmon to be better than...say...any random cafe. It was not. It was on the lower side of average...kind of small and too dry. The one saving grace for this place was that it was not too expensive. We had a complimentary card for the appetizer, so the bill with tip was exactly $50. I can think of literally a dozen other places $50 gets two people a better experience and food. Considering we eat every dinner out, we get around a lot. I can assure you Bonefish is off the list. Maybe I'll forget all of this in a year or three and try again then. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It was a fun club with good music and entertainment, but everything else about it sucked and still sucks. Smells fishy, actually. - We had a reservation for 12 adults, but only room for 4-6. - We had to get extra tables because there was not enough room for everyone, which cost twice the price of our agreed rates. They also tried to scam us on the price of bottles. - We paid over 2k in cash, which was then charged to a credit card. None of the managers have returned multiple phone calls/e-mails to get this rectified. For bottle service, guests should not be making their own drinks. Our waitress was barely present the entire time. We paid for a VIP experience and at the end of the day we feel like we got totally scammed. Don't go here if you want a VIP experience... you won't get one and you'll most likely get scammed as well. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I moved to Plaza Midwood a few months ago. I eat out a lot. I have eaten at the Diamond quite a few times and have found it to be a nice place with nice servers. You kind of know not to have high expectations in a place like this but it is a funky neighborhood spot. Today I was out and about with my dog. He was really hot and I knew I needed to get him some water and out of the sun. The patio was completely open at the Diamond with only one couple sitting outside. I found a nice shady table with good people watching for my dog and I. And then I waited, and I waited, and I waited. Finally a server came out to check on the other table. When she didn't acknowledge me I called to her, ""Ma'm...Ma'm? Ma'm"" She completely ignored me. I asked the other couple if I was supposed to go in and ask to be seated. They said, ""don't worry, she will come back out."" They actually gave me their menu. Another 10 minutes went by. I was just about to give up when a couple walked in with their little girl. The mom went in while the dad and daughter sat at the table next to me. A server came right out and took their order! So I asked the girl, was I supposed to come in and ask to be seated? She said well normally yes but she would have someone come out and help me. A third server came and finally took my order. I had probably been there 20 min. By this time I really didn't feel like eating. I ordered a dessert as I thought it would be rude to only have tea. I left her a $20 bill for a $6 check to show my appreciation that she at least waited on me when the other two women would not. I am a really nice person and I feel like I was treated shamefully. Needless to say, the Diamond won't see any more of my business. Which is really sad. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I was surprised to find out Fat Choy was in the Eureka Casino. I haven't been in the Eureka Casino in over 15 years, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The casino itself hasn't changed much in that time,but the restaurant Fat Choy stands out from the decor like a diamond sparking in the sand. The smoke which permeates the casino stops at the door and the lighting of the restaurant changes the mood almost as dramatically as the sudden absence of the sound of slot machines and casino sounds. The smell of the unique food sparked my appetite and the menu is broad but not over whelming. I was attending a 9 course meal and I wasn't sure about a few of the courses (Shrimp Toast, Bone Marrow, & Duck Bao), but was open to trying new things. I was very happy to learn I enjoyed each one of them. The Pork Potstickers were excellent and Shortrib Grill Grilled cheese was a great combination and flavorful. The only item on the menu I was not impressed with was the Duck Rice. Although it was good, it didn't live up to the remainder of the courses and was bland in comparison. The beer selection was limited to three and not much of a selection, although all three are decent beers. The seating was well spaced and comfortable without being cramped. I realize the experience would not be the same on an other daily visit, but the food and atmosphere was more than enough to bring me back again. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've been here a ton of times and enjoyed Nine Fine Irishmen, but my last visit wasn't the best. We were coming back in the late evening (9-ish) from a show and wanted to eat. They sat us in no man's land where apparently not only were there no other diners, there were also no servers. Yikes! We waited for a long time before finally flagging someone down. We shared the sausage appetizers. Good for the first few bites but damn, that's a lot of sausage! I know, I know... that's what she said. Anyway, the sausage became pretty one note and we ended up not finishing it or ordering anything else. Our server disappeared again, pretty much never to be seen or heard from again. I will say though that I've had some pretty rockin' food here in the past. Their sandwiches are good, especially the curried chicken. Would I hit up Nine Fine again? Probably, but during daylight hours and I'd insist on having an actual server. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Kiwi and the other optician I worked with were really friendly and nice. The optometrist was fine--nothing special. Neutral. Even with two vision insurances I still paid $150 OOP... I called to order contacts and it has been a really hard time getting a hold of the manager to order due to my multiple insurances. When it finally came time to order, I magically find out that there's a $10 shipping fee. Talk about nickel and dime-ing customers. After I told the man I spoke to about how I was surprised, he sounded annoyed and his attitude changed immediately. I thought the shipping cost would ship it straight to my house. After I gave him my credit card number he tells me ""Oh. We will call you when they're ready for pick up."" What the hell. Why do I have to waste gas money to pick up the damn contacts if I already paid shipping for the convenience? I didn't wanna be a jerk and make him cancel the order again. I really appreciated the two ladies who worked the reception area on Saturday. But after this, I will just order my contacts on 1800CONTACTS with FREE SHIPPING directly to my house. I will not return. I would've given 1-star, but my glasses came back quickly which I appreciate so I added a star. And the 3rd star goes to the 2 ladies. See ya later Pearle Vision.

 Not all that good, unless you're drunk and cutting the rug, I guess. My wife and I stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and it was a decent-sized crowd enjoying the nice weather. I perked up when the server told me it was happy hour. However, this is the lamest happy hour I've ever seen or heard of. $3 domestic bottles? What kind of happy hour is that? Who is charging more than $3 for a bottle of Bud Light even at the worst of times? And of course, I go through the normal shenanigans with the server as I ask for other bottles that are made in the US but somehow aren't included in the special. Fat Tire, etc. These are domestic, but no, you can't have them for $3. I order the carne asade tacos: $10, no rice or beans. No chips on the table. The meat is very sparse, and the rest of the taco is mushy stewed tomato. The tortillas are mushy as well, and there is a sad sprinkling of lettuce in the middle of the plate that would barely be sufficient for one taco, let alone the three that are on the plate. I took 2 bites and sent it back. My wife had a chimichanga which was OK. And by OK, I mean it's on par with what you might buy in the freezer at Safeway. On the plus side, the server was really nice.

 This is an excellent place to watch a game. If I had only been there to watch a game I might give this place about 4 stars, but I'd had a long day, wanted to watch a game and unwind with a couple glasses of wine and some dinner. I stopped in recently with a friend when in the area and Roka seemed less than lively. Our guess that this place might be more lively was perhaps correct, in that it had 6 people at the bar rather than 4 and had about 30 flat screen TV's running baseball games and various other sporting events. We chose to sit at the bar, because I always think you get better service there and the restaurant itself was pretty slow at 730 on a weeknight. That thing about better service didn't really hold up here as it seemed out bartender was also handling issues around the restaurant and after I finished my first glass of wine the glass sat empty for quite some time before someone came by to see about a refill. I will tolerate just about anything as long as I have a cocktail in front of me, and as pouring drinks is the primary function of a bartender this was more than slightly annoying. We ordered the ahi appetizer for a starter (I know I should probably be slapped for even ordering something like this in a sports bar). I had a couple bites and they were okay, but parts of the fish were actually starting to grey, which can't be a good sign. For dinner we had the salmon and a flatbread. Both the bartenders on duty raved about the flatbreads. I believe they have never eaten a flatbread anywhere else or they probably would stop raving about these. It was a relatively flavorless bread, which was not at all crisp on the bottom or the edges, lightly topped with cheese, sauce and some bits of chicken. It was edible as a food dish, but the part I found off putting was that the bread seemed to be taking on the flavor of the wooden paddle it was served upon. Yes, I know you can cook bread over wood and it will take on the wood flavor, but I am 99% sure this was coming off the wooden serving board. I actually took most of it home and the taste went away by the next day and the whole thing was well served by about 5 minutes in the toaster oven. The salmon was also very very okay. The best thing I think we ate was the broccoli side that came out with the fish. They were sharp green, flavorful and cooked perfectly. The fish was kind of overdone and uninteresting. I feel like maybe this place should go to a smaller menu to be able to have more consistency with preparation. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Wow, worst customer service ever. We went there a while back. We chose to eat there cuz my bro in law had bets on the basketball games, so we figured we would go watch the games and drink some beers. -First problem is he asked for a glass of water to go along with his pint, the waitress said they only sell water for $1. Can you say, Illegal? -Second, all of the tv's were on sports center while the games were on. We asked our server to change a tv that only our table could see to the game. She responded with ""all of the tv's have been requested to be on a certain channel by other guests."" The place was practically empty. -Third, we ordered a $7 chips n salsa started and received half a basket of chips and prepackaged salsa. I asked for a refill of chips and she said she would ask about refills, and never came back. -Four. They had a special for a gallon (ish) personal table beer dispenser. I asked for that with the ""blondies"" brand beer and was told they only fill it with buttwiper products, even though it says nowhere on the menu that it was restricted to that brand. -Five. the food sucked. I didn't expect much from a sports pub inside the miracle mile.. but this was really bad. -Six and final. I asked to speak to a manager and I addressed all my concerns list with him. As for the water, he told me it cost money to wash the glass so they can't give free water. I just spent well over $100. I think that can cover the rinsing of a glass. As per the TV situation. He told me that it is first come first serve, but he would be happy to put a game on for me. (we're done eating now and don't care) As per the chips. He said he will get us more chips. Again, we're done eating and don't care.) As for the beer special, He told me that the menu should say its restricted, but won't do anything about it. I told him it was false advertisement and he compared his restaurant to a STRIP CLUB in saying that just because they say you're buying a lap dance doesn't mean you're not going to get a BJ+. He blamed all of our problems on the waitress and told us not to tip her if we weren't happy with her service. I responded with fact that it was his fault because he is in charge and even if I didn't tip her, the company would still tax her for it. Overall, I will never go back to this dump. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Le Centre Sheraton is centrally located for travellers to Montreal. Walking distance to most of the tourist location. Close to 2 Metro Stations and just a stone throw away from Bell Centre if you are in town for some Hockey action.

 My friend and I went here before going to Zumanity. I am usually not a fan of eating at NYNY because the restaurants don't seem that great (Il Fornaio). I looked up the reviews on yelp for Gallagher's and it got good reviews, so we gave it a shot. I rarely eat steak but when I do I want it to be good. I had a reservation and when we arrived almost the whole restaurant was empty but the host was was having a hard time finding our reservation and took a few minutes to find it with the help of 3 people. I don't know why didn't just seat us, hmm. The place does not have a modern feel to it, and usually when I am going to spend alot of money on food I kind of enjoy the atmosphere as well too. That aside, we were so excited about the bread since you usually get really yummy bread at steakhouses. The bread was the really crusty kind and flaky but soft in the middle, a sourdough loaf. Not what we were expecting. I guess I am used to the pretzel bread, cheesy bread, and all the other cool kinds of bread you get at other steakhouses. The service was very good, someone there to fill your water every time you took a sip practically. My friend and I shared the cowboy rib-eye steak $38 it was very big. The steak just wasn't as good as I hoped for. The sauce on top was good. We shared 4 cheese mac and cheese and creamed spinach-both I enjoyed. But usually sides at steakhouses are always good. The portion was pretty small on the sides. We shared a toffee bread pudding dessert with vanilla ice cream. It was the size of a brownie. It was good but not amazing. I would not go back here. I prefer Nine, T-bones, Fleming's, etc. ",0,0,1,0,0

 PAINFULLY SLOW Stopped by for breakfast at 10:15AM. The line to be seated was long and slow and there were plenty of open seats. After being seated it took way too long to take my order for coffee and the follow-up to take the meal order dragged on. I was 2/3 through my meal when the waitress checked in on me. I asked for more coffee. 10 minutes later I had to ask again. She delivered the check without me asking... THEN a server arrived to pour a refill of coffee... I signed the check... THEN another server delivered a near empty carafe of coffee. Las Vegas is a town that knows how to pump plane loads of people in and out of every venue. Aria Cafe is run like a restaurant that just opened and is working out the kinks vs. an establishment that has been open for several years. While it is easy to point to the staff as inattentive my sense is all of this is due to poor front of the house management. Lost in the ridiculously slow service was the smoked salmon platter I ordered-- spot on! ",0,1,0,0,0

 After years of seeing Jose Andres on TV, I finally got to try some of his food and I was not disappointed. My wife and I ordered the chorizo with papas, 1/2 carafe of sangria, jamon of the tomato garlic toast, tempura shrimp, onion tortilla espanola and a spinach salad. All of the dishes were balanced and well executed. I really enjoyed the shrimp and the toast tasted exactly how I've had it in Madrid. The sangria was perfect for me and light enough for my wife to enjoy it. The only bummer was that the chorizo was a tad spicy and it caught you off guard, since I don't see Spanish food as spicy. Overall it was a great experience and I would highly recommend it to my friends. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Green cab picked me up this morning, and I just had to write a review after the stellar service I received from Jerry. First, when I called, they advised me on the time I should request, they were very concerned about having me to my destination in time. I was impressed by that, and I took their advice and scheduled a bit earlier than I would have. The cab arrived early, but didn't call, I only knew he was there from peeking out the window. My place can be a bit tricky to find, but the driver came exactly to the spot I'd requested. I came out quickly because I didn't know how long he would sit there. (He later let me know that he would have waited five minutes before calling, since he was early.) The driver got out and came around the back of the car when he saw me. I only had a small package, and I said I didn't need the trunk opened, because I'd carry it with me in the car. He chuckled and explained that he was 'bringing chivalry back', and always comes out and opens the car door for ladies, as well as offering his arm when the sidewalk is slippery in winter. That was nice. He later went on to explain that he is a driver trainer for Green Cab, and encourages everyone he trains to do the same. He says he wants to treat everyone the way he would want his mother treated. This is a somewhat rare thing these days, and very much appreciated. Because he was so early, he took me on a scenic tour of State St., even stopping so I could snap pictures of some ice sculptures. What a nice start to the morning. I reached my destination with time to spare, very relaxed. And besides all this, Green cab is the cheapest ride in town. Now I have more background on the company too, and it is one I will continue to support. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place committed just about all of the worse offenses a restaurant can. First, my group's waiter seemed to be bothered by us because we walked in when the place was empty (you'd think they would be excited to have a chance to make a tip). Second, I ordered the spicy scallop roll and after eating one piece of it I called the waiter over and told them that the scallop was bad (rancid!). My tables waiter then proceeded to yell over to the sushi chef that I said the scallops were not bad, and the chef argued with me. Now, this is when I got extremely P.O.ed and told them to take the roll back, don't bring anything else, and don't charge me. Lucky they agreed or they would have been hearing from me again the next day when I was sick to my stomach. I can only imagine what would have happened to me had I eaten more than one piece...Don't risk your life by trying this dive... ",1,0,0,0,0

 Locals get it. Tourist don't. It's classic, elegant, and fun. It's a welcome change from what Vegas has become by always being what its always been. The food is decent and the staff share an independent charisma. This is not your Food network celebrity chef B.S. This has been a Las Vegas staple for several decades. Appreciate it for what it is or GTFO! Location a problem? You're an idiot. Go home! You didn't like the presentation? Shut the hell up! You KNOW you paid more, waited longer, and got some bitchy comment from the cashier at that crapyass food truck last week then yelped about how awesome was. Service sucked? See above comment I hope this helped you in your assessment of the aforementioned venue and future yelp reviews. Enjoy. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Went here for lunch today & wasn't really impressed. Ordered jalapeno bean dip for a starter & it was tasty though it seemed to take a while to get something so simple. Ordered something from the lunch menu. It was a chicken enchilada with jalapeno cheese sauce. It didn't come with much cheese sauce & the enchilada was really wet. It didn't seem like grease, more like water or something. It was just unappetizing, though the taste was alright. Husband ordered pollo con queso which was good. One of the few reasons this review gets three stars. Decor was nice too. Oh & the bathroom was smelly. Overall, not worth another visit. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Lots of good details in other reviews as to how the show and the interaction works. This is a great show to bring kids that like loud noises and like to bang on things as there are many opportunities to pound away with the drumsticks. Warning, this is a very NOISY show, and while the idea is comparative to STOMP, it is quite different and more noise than music. Don't bring grandma and grandpa. The percussion was very repetitive. I was surprised at how short the show was, starting at 7 and over just after 8. Show price comes with a free drink, but line up early because the line gets long. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Two of my friends and I decided to get our nails done yesterday, and we just went as walk-ins a little after 5. They said the wait was like 20 minutes, so we didn't mind waiting. They close at 7, but stayed open to finish our nails. There were a couple other ladies finishing up as well. It was so nice of them to stay later than they're supposed to to finish our nails. However, the guy who did the nails wasn't the nicest, and by time he got to the third girl, he was rude and a little sloppy. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Went to our first spring training game on a nice, warm Sunday afternoon....Giants v diamondbacks. What a great facility. First, so close to our place, we rode our bikes. Convenient bike racks out front and we saved $5 on parking. Not a bad seat in the place, we sat in the front row down from the dugout on the 1st baseline. Great view of the pitchers warming up and the players walking back and forth. Nice new facilities....clean bathrooms, good concessions, plenty of services and a nice, friendly crowd, even if you're a Giants fan! We had good margaritas from Saltys and yummy, warm chocolate chip cookies. We are going to another game next week at night during the week, so we will see how that is. And I'm looking forward to checking out some of their other upcoming events once spring training is done. ",0,0,0,0,1

 For someone who has sky dived and still fear heights (they say it's best to conquer your fears by facing it... well, it didn't work for me) this was an exciting and yet scary experience for me. The ride is smooth but as it gets higher and higher so did my blood pressure and sweaty palms. Seemed like everyone else in our cabin was just fine - my family plus another family. Kids and adults were standing on the edge some even leaning against the rail which really made me nervous! The structure and engineer work looks impressive until I noticed there were two bolts missing attaching our cabin to the wheel (I'm sure it was by design but couldn't they have filled those holes?). Plus side -- views were great all around and my kids under 13 rode for free and we got $5 discounts off adult tickets. My recommendation for those who fear heights but still want to go on it, have a drink before going up. Oh and the on boarding off boarding part was interesting -- you walk up to the moving cabin with no safety railings in place (not really) just workers there to guide you -- think if you misstepped and fell over the edge oh man! Luckily there's a safety net in place, however you don't see it until you're in the cabin so you have to kind of take a leap of faith. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I ate here for the first time today. My impression was that the only reason to go here is that it's dirt-cheap. Other than that, it was completely unremarkable. The food was no better than a fast food chain, and the person at the register seemed very tired, apathetic, and unwelcoming. I don't plan to ever return. If I want a cheap lunch, I'll go to Kiva Han and get the Granola Works, because that at least tastes good and is healthy. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The only good part from the experience my husband and I got from this place was the shrimp and mango entree.. The flavor of the curry laksa wasn't so bad but for some reason, the chicken inside was only room temperature. My husband asked them to make him a fresh one and they insisted that it was fresh and that if they made it again it would be exactly the same. So my husband decided to order a different soup and got the coconut chicken soup instead. Again, the chicken in the soup came out room temperature. We don't know how they've managed to do it twice with two different soups! I ordered the beef rendang and it was just ok, nothing special about it. The server asked me and I told her honestly what I thought about it but I told her that it was fine. I guess she told her supervisor coz next thing u know, the manager comes to our table. The part that irritated me the most was that he made us seem like we were lying about our complaints on the temp Of our food. To make it worse, the manager then proceeds to tell me that I probably haven't tasted authentic Asian food. I'm Asian and I've tried so many different authentic Asian food. They just managed to make theirs absolutely nothing special and not worth my money. I'm only giving the second star for our server because she was very nice. To sum this all up, it was a waste of money. Needless to say, my husband and I will not be going back there again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 In my quest to support local businesses, we checked out Egg Works this morning. SInce it was after 10 on a Sunday morning, I figured it would be crowded and it was. We only waited about 10 minutes. That was a shock. Our server was Kim and she was outstanding. The food was OK. I had regular pancakes, eggs over medium, and bacon. She asked if I wanted the bacon crisp and it was (crispy and good). The eggs were runnier than I wanted (maybe my fault for not asking for over hard). I am a pancake lover and the pancakes were some of the worst that I've had a restaurant. I didn't like the taste of the batter and they were too heavy and doughy. My partner tried them and liked them. He had waffles, ham and scrambled. He didn't like his waffle and neither did I. Something about the batter. ANYWAY...The place is called Egg Works...I will go back. I liked the atmosphere. I really enjoyed the employees. They were all very nice, helpful, and funny. Next time, I will focus on an egg dish which I'm sure will be very good. Oh...we did order a banana nut muffin because so many Yelp reviewers talked about it. It was definitely delicious and I'll stick to that next time. There will be a next time... ",0,0,1,0,0

 Ok. Re doing my review. Check in I wasn't told that detail takes on average witch I find hard to be figure out why yes detail is hard work but in Phx where there are alot of guys on detail line crew. This took 2 1/2 hours. I was not told anytime when I signed up for it. So here I am waiting over 2 hours getting pissed due to fact my car came out fast and thought it was ready. The one person that did care was the person who rang me up. I didn't catch his name, but the second time he came outside to talk witch was close to the 2 hour point I was a little pissed and I think he saw. Offered to get the "" so called manager"" I explained to him that I waited 2 hours without a time. His come back that he would explain to staff to tell customers. He didn't offer any offers like half off car wash etc. since we live in the area and use there services all the time. I felt bad for detail line. They had 3 guys on shift Monday full bay plus some yahoo wanted to detail a buss so took 2 guys off the line and left 1 guy. I would of pushed the card out of your bay first then detail the buss I personally won't be back. Not even a percent off next service meh. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The hubby and I hung out around Fusion Mixology Bar located inside the Palazzo since we were waiting for the show ""Panda"" to start. There was nothing really special about the drinks we ordered and the ambience was okay. Their beers surprisingly were not served in glass bottles but rather in aluminum cans so my hubby didn't really like the tin taste he got from his Heineken. I had my regular Red Bull Vodka and it was a bit on the strong / bitter side but drinkable. All in all this bar was all right, nothing stood out to make me want to hang out here again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We couldn't leave a Vegas weekend without having a buffet meal of some sort so we whipped out our handy dandy Yelp apps on our iPhones and found the nearest one with decent reviews and price range. We decided to try Spice Market Buffet for two reasons - the price range was decent and we'd never been to Planet Hollywood hotel before so at least we'd get to see something new. Despite warnings about longer than long lines we got there and waited for about 10 minutes before paying and being seated. It wasn't fast but it wasn't terrible. Cost was $24.99 per person which was more than we would have liked but the variety of food that we were eyeing while in line made up for it. Between the three of us we downed 7 plates filled with a range of food including breakfast (waffles with lovely ph logos on them!), sushi, prime rib, pizza, asian food, mediterranean food (dolmas were delicious), quesadillas, and seafood. We topped it off with some soft serve and cotton candy which ended the meal quite nicely. Plus, there were a ton of things we didn't even attempt like the crepes, lasagnas, soups, salads, etc. We were just too full already! Overall, a perfect way to end a weekend getaway in Vegas.

 Listen to other poor reviews. This is the worst Pizza Hut I've ever gone to. The lobby closes at 8:30 and they make you pick up through a drive thru which gets backed up quickly.

This store does not care about customer satisfaction or making things right... They just want your money. Do yourself a favor and stay far, far away from this specific Pizza Hut location. Unless they begin to turn things around, I expect eventually they will be forced to shut down this store location. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Fresh, funny and good looking...and that was just our waitress/owner. She was so funny and treated us like family. And now for the food review. I really liked it! It's Wickenburg delicious, not Los Angeles China Town delicious but really good fresh food. I had tofu with veggies and hot chili oil on the side and my husband AKA Pumpkin had broccoli with carrots. I ate lots of his food too. I looked over the drink menu and wanted to hit that but I had to work the next day. I think the Mai Tais were $4.50 and that seems pretty good.

 This place has to be one of the best pool parties that I've ever been too!!! Our group got a day bed and it was perfect for our group of 12. Only a few people laid on the bed because most everyone was either in the pool, dancing, or roaming around. The bottles took a little while to get to the table initially but once it got there, the waitress was great at keeping it flowing. The place itself was huge so when the party got going it didn't feel crowded at all. We danced our a$$ off and had the best time of our lives.

 I went here based on all the red-hot Yelp reviews. I made my appt with Darci, since she is said to know how to ""funk-up"" a 'do. Right on. I went in with an idea of what I wanted. I can honesty say Darci delivered. It was a shock to walk out of there with short hair, though. Yes, I wanted a cut. I wanted something manageable for the summertime. And yes, I'd say it was kinda funky, too, with the pieces in front - those framing my face - were quite longer than the ones in the back, which were now cut above my nape. Darci did a great job on delivering what I asked for. I'll give her that. She even explained how/why she'd have to cut it short to accommodate what I wanted. Fair enough. She asked questions, which I appreciated, so that I would leave there without super short bangs. I told myself to wait a few days before reviewing the place. Come to find out, my style was hard to, well, style. Even with the Sexy Hair product I picked up at the salon. That's when I became disappointed and took it upon myself to snip here and snip there at home to create the look I was going for. It didn't take much. Just a few extra minutes and a little off at the front... and then I LOVED my cut. Except for the bangs. It's been over a month since my cut here and I'm JUST NOW liking them. Go figure. I don't think that should be the case. Am I right? As for service, it was top-notch, all the way around. The interior of the place is cool. There was no DJ on the Saturday I went. Just a Depeche Mode CD that decided to skip. Funny... I do love the graffiti on the side of the building. I didn't get any ""new customer $10 discount"" I read about here, which was another draw to this place. My cut cost me $40. They were having a great sale on hair products, so I picked up a spray wax. In total, with the cut, the product and tip, I walked out spending $60. Not bad! Would I go back? Well... I'm already looking around for another salon to try. So, does that tell you anything? I would go back, yes, if I can find nothing else, for Darci is cool and the haircut I got here was okay. Nothing I ended up doing back-flips over. But, I've had much worse. As for these Yelp reviews... I gave Darci and ""You've Been Yelped Card,"" especially since at her booth, she had a little CitySearch flyer, plugging how people love Way Cool Hair. I figured it was about time she knew about Yelp, since it's what brought her and I together. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We were in Arizona for three days, and unfortunately I hardly had one good meal in this state. In search for good food for fair prices, we came here. We got the mushroom soup, pork belly, buffalo steak, their creme brulee, and coffee. We arrived here with high hopes, which were crushed pretty quickly. We were sat by the back door which was propped open on a very cold night. So after sitting here for a little while, I asked for my boyfriend's jacket, and soon after, he had to go to the car to get another jacket so that we would both be covered. Once we ordered our food, we had to wait a good while before the waiter came with the first course: pork belly and sausage. He simply put the plate down on the table and walked away. He didn't say here's your first course, or describe the meal, it felt to me as if he almost threw the plate in front of me. The sausage was good, but both my boyfriend and I thought the pork belly was overdone, and it wasn't quite as fatty as we usually like. Next was the soup and the buffalo. We asked for the buffalo to be medium rare, which it wasn't. It was cooked to medium with the last one third of it being well-done. The soup while well seasoned and flavorful, seemed to lack body and depth. Next we ordered coffee, which came to us almost cold, and the waiter never offered to refill our cup. We also got the creme brulee since our waiter suggested it. The creme was a trio: a vanilla, chocolate, and a pumpkin. All three shared two problems: the sugar had been laid on a very thick layer, resulting on a think candy like crust instead of the mere crunch a proper creme brule would have. The texture was also unpleasant, and it seemed like the eggs had curdled a bit, so it wasn't as smooth as I like. Moreover, the pumpkin one really didn't taste that good at all. We wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My favorite Target store in town for many reasons... The store is always clean. They have a huge selection. The grocery store has EVERYTHING. The prepared foods/deli section can save me from cooking for days. I love the huge selection of household storage. The checkout is painless. They always have a good number of lanes open so I never have to wait in long lines. I'm even impressed with the short wait I had to return something during holiday season. I wish they could improve the parking situation. The lot is huge, but the store is at a narrow end where there is less parking. That means there are plenty of spots to park, but they are all far from the door. Good thing rain is rare. It would make the walk to the car pretty bad.

 I wouldn't even give the Bell Road Mazda Service Dep't ONE star, except thats the only choice I have. I thought I was in good hands, because my mom had been working with Pete since he was at Hyundai when she owned a vehicle with them, and now serviced her Mazda at this dealership where he worked. Well, I took the vehicle in for the oil change in September, to be told the motor mount is cracked BUT covered under warranty. They did not have the part in at that time, but Pete assured me it was covered under warranty and to let him know when I have the time to bring the car back in. No big deal, until I drive away and realize the tech BROKE the Left/Right toggle switch to adjust the side mirrors, and shoved the driver side vent adjuster clean into the dash somehow. I called Pete right away and came back. He peeked his head inside the car and I showed him the issues, and he felt the mirror switch was broken, then manually adjusted the passenger mirror for me so I could drive safely. I did not have another hour & 1/2 to wait for them to fix this, so Pete assured me they would take care of it at my next visit. Here it is December, I have a little time to bring it in, and Pete no longer works there. I explained in detail to John Friedman what happened, thinking the issue would be easily resolved as Pete said. John reached out to Pete, who remembers my mom, remembers me, my last visit with the car, but conveniently DOES NOT remember the switch being broken, the vent adjuster, OR manually adjusting my mirror for me, and did NOT note my account regarding the part # of the cracked motor mount OR TAT IT WAS CRACKED! So basically, I am being called a liar about their tech breaking the switch, AND the motor mount can't be called in until they have the car there, to see which part it is. So there's a good chance I will have to sit there only to be told they don't have the part. And now, I will have to pay for the part their tech broke and who knows about the warranty covering the motor mount since the mileage is drastically different by thousands. THUMBS DOWN. Do NOT expect to be taken care of if they do something wrong. As adults, most of us learn to take responsibility for what we do wrong, and to do a good job at whatever we do-like noting someone's account properly... but not The Chapman Mazda Service Dep't. Now I will be taking my vehicle to the Camelback location from now until I sell the Mazda and wash my hands with the company. Wish me luck... The is why I drive a Volkswagen-they know how to take care of their customers. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The wash was OK and didn't take too long. But I had a coupon for an oil change so I had them change it. During that process the mechanic told me the power steering fluid was very old and detrimental to the power steering pump. I agreed to let them change that as I was planning on a long trip the next day. Two weeks later my battery died and the dealership replacing it called to tell me my power steering fluid was very old and that although the sticker on my windshield indicated my oil had just been changed, the oil filter looked old and the viscosity of the oil in the truck looked very old. Somebody is not telling me the truth. My decision will be to never give Danny's any more business. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Very disappointed with the cashier we had. As we checked out & I swiped my debit card, the cashier rang up an item that was already included in my total (not quite a double charge as she started a new sale). However, when we got home we found that the 2nd to the last item in our sale never made it to my bag. If you (Walmart)want more info regarding this, you can respond to this acct with your contact info & I'll scan my receipt to you ",1,0,0,0,0

 I wish I could give it a bit higher of a rating.....My food was hands down FIVE stars but the service was just meh... We started with the table side Caesar Salad...by the way EVERYONE should make a tableside Caesar! But the person making it had NO personality....my husband even tried to joke around with him and he wouldn't crack a smile....tableside is about a show and we got no show....we barely got a hello. Our steaks were AMAZING I had a petite filet and it was cooked perfectly as our side were great too! Dessert...of course we had the tableside bananas foster...again...same dry tableside waiter....and the desert was just ok...wasn't the best bananas foster I had (I suggest stop using banana liqueur as you don't need a fake banana flavor and Bacardi 151 and use a brandy.....as it doesn't burn as fast and lets the bananas caramelize more without burning...and yes we make this dessert in our house frequently) I'd like to go back and have a different waiter...maybe I can upgrade to a 5 star review...as the food was certainly deserving of it.

 I can't really compare their Samosas to the rest of the world's, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. I tried the vegetarian and the lamb. I ended up preferring the vegetarian; though I love lamb, I found the fluffy potatoes and the bite of the peas inside the crunchy shell really enjoyable. The lamb samosa seemed a bit dry and flavorless. I ordered the chicken tikka masala, to use as a standard of measure. I've had several versions by now and enjoyed most of them a bit more than this. I felt that this one was pretty mediocre, with big tough chunks of chicken in a lot of runny sauce. The amount of rice they give is a single bowlful per entree, which is OK if it's one person but wouldn't be enough to feed both my boyfriend and I. I'm not sure if they charge for the additional portions of rice, but it would be worth asking if you order more. Also, I like spicy food. A lot! I initially ordered the Extra hot version of the dish, which the server assured me would be extremely hot. ""Face melting""-ly so. I eventually backed down to just the ""hot"". I ended up being very disappointed by the overall heat level. The other diner in the party who ordered a hot dish agreed in that her dish wasn't particularly spicy, either. The overall flavor wasn't too impactful- initially it had a nice creeper heat, but it hit a mid-note and then mellowed out. There were a few pieces of fresh herbs floating about in the orange sauce, which is a nice touch. Their rice had a good texture. I like that they have clearly marked and distinguished menus for vegetarians and vegans. I'd be willing to give them another chance if someone wanted us to go, but they're out of my way and didn't particularly impress me the first time around. I liked that their iced chai tea was served without milk or creamer, making it a lot lighter and more refreshing. I'd never had it straight like that and it was nice. Another diner tried the mango lassi and didn't like it. It was then offered on to any willing participants and eventually found it's way into a garbage can several miles away and melted...

 Not satisfied, service was poor and could tell the host was lying to us. We ordered ""dual-shrimp and chicken fried rice"" and ""beef pan fried noodles"". The beef wasnt all to bad, but nothing to get excited over. Not sure if our other dish even had shrimp in it with small bits of chicken here and there, not worth the price for that dish what so ever.

 Pros- cute old-style Italian mom & pop restaurant has a deli area with Italian desserts, fresh pizza, and meat/cheese had like 3 servers attending us to get drinks and napkins etc huge portions like 3 days worth Cons- -decor is dated and really needs an update inside with music, better furniture, lighting etc.. -service is really slow with cooks taking forever taking like 30 min on appetizer and meals -expensive food need to bring down the price esp on the food that is sucky tasting -BIGGEST CON:food is hit or miss (for instance the wings were dry and not hot or with much sauce on them, my dinner and my friends dinner were gross-I got spaghetti with meat sauce and she had chicken with peppers we both didn't finish yucky food-didnt even look good, but my fiance and his friend's dinner were delicious-veal parmisian and cavaTELLI with alfredo sauce) I really was disappointed b/c i was expecting a delicious home made Italian meat sauce with fresh tasting herbs like my family makes and it was nasty like jar tasting with mushy linguine however I've never had cavatelli before and it was delcious and so was the alfredo sauce on my fiance dish would I go back? prob not if I did I would makes sure not in a hurry to go anywhere and ask server what's good or stick with alfredo sauce not to make same mistake with gross food again ",0,1,0,0,0

 We LOVE their pizza! We get it downtown all of the time so we tried the HQ. We sat at the bar and WOW they couldn't care less that we were there! This is an old people gaming bar so they don't need our measly beer and pizza money. I put in a $20 but that's small potatoes here, I guess. They didn't take our order, they were short with us and the SECOND I cashed out, they through down the ""reserved for gamers"" sign on my machine. I'm sure they won't even care about this review. Why would they? The staff is getting tipped from all of the old gamers... Who are we? The location in the Four Queens is closer anyway. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Besides a tasty menu using fresh ingredients and prepared fresh each day, for those on a tight schedule late afternoon or early evening, from 4 to 6 PM the happy hour half price tapas selections can't be beat. Ask Jamie the bartender for recommendations based upon your health issues or palate preferences, and he'll be happy to help you out. My friend who goes with me when I'm in town can't eat mayo or fries so Jamie made a great tasting healthy selection as a substitute. So, when I come to town, I try to stop when I'm in the area at least once. Don't forget the wine discounts included during HH 4-6. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I really want to know what all the fuss is about. Seriously, can somebody fill me in? I was at Nobu recently with a couple co-workers on a business trip and we decided to splurge on the Omakase. I've said it before...if I'm spending $100/head on a meal it better be transcendent. I want to leave the table full and buzzing and humming about how awesome the food was. This meal was, frankly, lousy. Nearly everything that came out was drenched in citrus, which overpowered the fish. Isn't fish supposed to be the showpiece of a good sushi restaurant? And, honestly, that's the only real takeaway I had from this meal. Too much citrus. Everything. I'll save my Omakase dollars for Austin's Uchi. Now *that's* transcendent. ",0,1,0,0,0

 A visit to Portovino will remind you how easy it is to claim that you're something special, and how different it is to prove it. If you've read my other reviews, you'll know I love my sushi grade tuna steaks. I enjoy going to a restaurant and trying their version, especially when the server tells me how good it is. Portovino's tuna steak, at $36, was actually 4 1.5""x1.5""x1"" (approx.) cubes. Is that enough for a meal? Is that worth anywhere close to $36? Nah. Not even close. The pieces were nice, but the multi-coloured sesame seeds added nothing. In fact, they took away from the dish. I cut off the edges to eat them first (otherwise I would have starved) to leave just the tuna to finish my ""meal"" - if you can call it that. The tuna was tasteless, which was an absolute shame. Surprisingly (and thankfully) the wasabi sauce that decorated the plate helped and was not as overpowering as I feared. The side mashed potatoes and vegetables (peppers and zucchini) were actually better prepared than the $36 fish. (shaking my head). Quite disappointing, especially considering that of the 5 of us at the table who ordered the tuna, no one was impressed - but that might be because I got the best looking tuna of all of them. One person got 5 pieces instead of my 4, but the 5th was a tiny, scrap end piece that should have been eaten by the chef instead of served. The service was pleasant, thank you. The minestrone soup was very tasty, and some in our party did enjoy their meals, despite various degrees of temperature accuracy. Unfortunately, one person ordered a $42 filet, medium rare. It was served well done (!!) with the rest of the dishes, and when she sent it back, it took 25 minutes (!!!!!) to come back rare, at best, but mostly raw. Unedible. We joked at how pissed off Gordon Ramsay would have been, but the real joke is Portovino, but without the laughter. Pretentious and uninspired. I don't like these qualities in people, and I hate them in establishments that charge a fee for the ""privilege"" of eating there. This visit was not my idea and I was not the host, and I guarantee I'll be choosing a different place when I do make the choice. If I didn't reserve my 1-star ratings for those establishments that were shockingly bad, Portovino might qualify. However, kind Mark awards them 2 stars (but they are really small stars, and very expensive.) ",0,1,0,0,0

 BESO VEGAS is a BUST!!! I ate here with 13 of my friend's for a birthday party who are all locals out looking for a good meal, but should of kept looking because we didn't find it here. First of all the hostess at the front door looked like a pit-bull with a personality to match, but for some reason couldn't keep her hands off waist line...why I have no ideas either and she wasn't aware we even had a party here as well. Let me just say the waitstaff was nice... the FOOD OMG is Todd English crazy to put his name on this restaurant or is his food really that disgusting. Of course with 13 people we had a variety...the Lobster, was bad, smelled bad, rubbery and under cooked in some cases. The steak was small and I asked for medium rare, it was served well done. No one was satisfied, and EXTREMELY disappointed....we expected so much more from Eva and Todd English, does cute little Eva know her restaurant is run like s--t or does she not care? Okay, so we said something to the giant Manager Chad that the food was horrible, he looked at me like I was crazy and said,, ""what can I do,"" I said it is to late now....then I asked him who was the General Manager, he then gets ROY the GM...who hired this loser...first of all I think he was buzzed as he was sweating and shaking like a leaf as well, was a as arrogant, and a pompous a--!

 In order to review this location, I was forced to give it a star. And that's being generous! I felt that everyone should be warned prior to visiting this downtown location. This has got to be the worst service; granted it was ""rush hour"", but it shouldn't take almost 20 minutes to make a simple turkey panini. What was even more aggravating was seeing people having ordered after me get their food first. The cashier gave me my coffee right after ordering, but I wanted to wait for my panini so as to not drink the whole thing prior to eating. By the time I actually got the chance to sit down and ""enjoy"" my panini and coffee, it was lukewarm at best. So disappointing. Avoid ordering food here at all costs! ",1,0,0,0,0

 3.5 stars, because it was only a tad bit better than okay. Came here for a late dinner and luckily made it to their Nightly Social Hour, which runs from 5pm - 10pm. We sat at the tables near the bar and ordered from the HH menu - salmon tartare toast, bone marrow and oxtail jam, oysters on the half shell, and from the regular dinner menu - the beef short rib. The salmon tartare toast was a total miss. There were only two small pieces of bread and the salmon tartare was a bit too fishy. I normally love salmon, but I think a tuna tartare would have gone much better for this dish. I would definitely skip this and get the beef tartare or the blue crab toast. The bone marrow and oxtail jam was really fatty and good. The flavors were great, but just remember that this is a very heavy dish. We had to leave a bite or two. The oysters were great. We got a half dozen, which was the perfect amount with everything we ordered. The biggest disappointment was the beef short rib. Our piece had way too much fat on it. It was already a smaller chunk of meat, but half of it was fat. Short rib isn't supposed to have THAT much fat on it. I asked the waitress if that was normal, and she just said ""Yes"" and walked away. No offer to replace the dish, no apologies, no explanation. For a $34 dollar plate, I would expect a better piece of meat/service. But on the up side, the cocktails were excellent - stiff and delicious. I believe all cocktails are HH prices during the Social Hour! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have eaten here once and refuse to go back; not because of the food (which was great) but because of the service, which was TERRIBLE. Our food took forever to arrive and when my friend went up to use the bathroom, the server snatched her plate away before I could say a word. I'm sorry, but when you are dropping 30-40 bucks between several small plates of food you should be able to actually EAT IT. We left a decent tip (20%) but as we were getting ready to go I saw our server talking to another server, pointing at us and his tip and smirking, like we didn't give him enough.

 This place is a MUST-GO while you're in Vegas. It's located inside Planet Hollywood and across from Rockbar, Fat Tuesday, and a Batman arcade game area. Sometimes the line looks long, but don't let that be deceiving. They are very efficient and it will be worth the wait, trust me. I've had the Earl's Club, Italian, and Full Montagu. I hear their cobb wraps are just as good. Their sandwiches are about $6, which is the best cheapest thing you can get in Vegas for an amazing hot sandwich. I make a stop here at least twice on every Vegas trip I've made. Earl's is too irresistible. At one point, Earl's was my breakfast/lunch/dinner/post-club food @ 6AM.

 Service sucks. And the food sucks. Only reason why I am giving 2 stars is because the DJ is sort of good. And I like the horror-theme they got going on inside, the Jason and zombie bride human figures looks pretty cool. Other than that, this place reminds me of those trashy joints back up in Reno, with art posers all full of themselves inside. They would rather chain smoke than work on their tip, and I regret tipping the bartender before my service was done, especially since she forgot that I prepaid for my second round of drinks and didn't even bother getting started on what I ordered from the menu. When my burger, pasta, and fries finally made it on my table, it was FUCKING COLD! Except the thick fries. It's the same cheap fries that you get from Walmart and throw it into a microwave. The stuff that college kids eat because they are too lazy to cook something real up. Burger was lukewarm, does not feel fully cooked. Everything on the plate felt and tasted like it was made with a half-assed effort. Like they tossed the entire stuff into the microwave and took 15 minutes to bring it back out. Like what a previous reviewer said, they are trying to do everything at once, and failing at every aspect of it. There are plenty of other places along the Chinatown area where the workers take more pride in their jobs. Here, this place is sort of nasty. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The Taco Shop serves pretty legit Mexican food, but it's nothing special. Since the bar isn't set so high for Mexican food in Madison, this place makes for a worthwhile stop whenever you're craving it. Most of the food here tastes like stuff you could make at home. But saving myself a couple hours of preparing meat and chopping vegetables makes this place seem worth the money. Sometimes this home-made taste is good, sometimes it's bad. The burrito, for example, is tasty for this exact reason. Combine that with how huge it is, and it makes for a great mainstay. On the other hand, some things like the tortilla chips and salsas thoroughly disappoint. The chips taste like Tostitos, and the salsa also resembles something you'd get from the discount aisle at the grocery store. This lack of creativity in places where it really matters leaves you wondering why they even bother in the first place. Any good Mexican restaurant will go to great lengths to perfect its own salsa. One exception to the home-made taste is the chimichanga. It is a delicious fried burrito smothered in all kinds of different sauces, making for a big flavorful mess. But at 8 to 9 dollars, you'll feel like you're kind of overpaying for it. It's not THAT good. However, they at least make up for it by making it so huge that it's impossible to finish in one sitting. All in all, the Taco Shop earns a solid 3 stars. It's good Mexican food. It's not great Mexican food. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I recently got my little baby pug Penny from a private breeder, so I wanted to take her to a vet and get her checked out. Animal Care Hospital was close to my house, so I figured I would give it a try. They were able to see me SAME DAY, which was an awesome treat. I was afraid I would have to wait several days for my new puppy exam and the medical guarantee from the breeder was only good for one week. Anyways, the vets office was conveniently located, the office is clean, the staff is friendly and everyone was in love with Penny. (it's hard not to be.. I know I am a proud mommy, but she really is adorable!) I sat down and filled out my paperwork and they took me back right away. The vet, Dr. Temple, was extremely friendly and thorough and answered all my questions. I signed up for the ""puppy package"" that basically takes you through all of the shots they need for the first few months, wellness exams, fecal test and a microchip and also includes a start up of heartworm preventer. Penny had her second set of shots the day prior when I purchased her from the breeder, but for some reason Dr. Temple gave her another set. She told me there was nothing to worry about but they didn't charge me, so I think she may have made a mistake. Penny was fine and she told me that it would not cause any problems, but I'm glad that she didn't make a mistake on something life threatening. (This is the only reason I am not giving ACHS five stars.) We went back three weeks later for our third set of shots and got in immediately. They were quick, friendly and efficient again and able to provide me with some suggestions on how to curb Miss Penny's biting habits. The only issues I have encountered were with the billing. I think that the puppy package confuses the billing girls a little, because both times I went in they had to make adjustments. Not a big deal, they took care of everything and refunded the incorrect amount immediately, I just hope it doesn't keep happening. Oh, another really cool feature is that your pet gets a login and you can keep track of service records through the vet. They have some cool features on the website where you can fill out forms for someone babysitting your pet and you can post pictures and put in information about the diet. I know I lose papers all the time, so its great to have all of Penny's records online where I can easily access them. They have awesome hours... so I can get in after work, and the location is convenient for me. They also sell different types of food and hygiene supplies there, so you can pick up stuff for your animal should you need to. I would definitely recommend this Vet's office to anyone.

 Breakfast is $20, but some nice lady clued us in on saving $5 if you sign up on the Stratosphere's Ace Play card at the Player's counter. That's what we did. 10 min later, saved us $10.

It served it's purpose for the day. Since we were riding the roller coasters on top of the stratosphere, it was a one-stop shopping place. I can't see any other reason to eat here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I don't know why I chose three stars...It just wasn't as bad as 2 stars but not as good as 4 stars. I just overall didn't really enjoy my experience here. The service was ok, just not super friendly. The food was decent but nothing special. I tried the chicken pad thai and the flavoring was just odd. It is almost as if they cooked some type of fishy fish in the same pan right before heating up my frozen meal. It came out too quickly to be very fresh and I couldn't really taste anything but a fishy aftertaste and there wasn't any fish in my dish. Bleh....The chicken was not tender either...it was chewy and I left most of it on my plate even though I really wanted the protein. It just wasn't worth choking down the ""smicken"" or whatever type of alternate meat it was. Won't be back.. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I went here to exchange a part (oil drain plug) that I purchased from another location that did not fit my car at it should. It turned out the package contained the incorrect plug (from the manufacturer). When returning the part, the guy at the counter asked the supervisor what to do with the part I was returning.... He said 'Re-sell it. We have to for inventory'. So you're going to try to sell it to someone else knowing it is wrong??? That's horrible. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Big massive country bar/restaurant in the hills. It is OK and I'd rate it more towards family fun. A bit expensive and for the money I feel that you could get better food elsewhere. As for the view, love it. I'll play... I'll steal the rating system used elsewhere on here. Scale of 1-10 (two visits): 7: Food 0: Drinks (not rated) 7: Service 7: Atmosphere 7: Value ",0,0,1,0,0

 I visited this little hidden gem on a Friday night. Only one other party was dining in and a few people came in for take-out. I ordered the Veg Egg Roll, Tom Kar soup, and Panang noodles with beef. Everything came out quickly and steaming hot...and absolutely delicious. Total with tip was $15. They also have homemade green tea or coconut ice cream, which I really wanted to try but was too full. I will absolutely come back!! This is a must try for any Thai food lover. Service was speedy, warm & inviting. Eat there, and then tell your friends! ",0,0,0,0,1

 This is the best sushi in Pittsburgh. I have been to every sushi restaurant in Pittsburgh, including Umi, and I feel comfortable putting Little Tokyo at the top. Okay, real talk: this is gonna get gushy. I love this place. Not gonna lie, the outside of the store looks straight up sketchy. It's on East Carson in South Side and is surrounded by a less-than-nice area. The exterior is lit with cheesy neon signs and a fake, Chinese-looking set of doors. But their service is really friendly and their sashimi is completely fresh. The sashimi test is pretty simple: if it tastes buttery, crisp and melts in your mouth, it's the real deal. If it has any kind of fishy, salty or ocean-y odor or taste, chances are it's been sitting out for a while or hasn't been kept cold enough. If you're a sushi person chances are you've ordered rolls with crab in them before. Surprise: most of the time it isn't real crab. Little Tokyo, on the other hand, puts real crab in their rolls.... for like... half the price of anywhere else. In fact, all of the rolls are priced ridiculously cheaply (under 13 dollars, even for stuff like dragon rolls and scallop rolls). How do they do this? Illegal fish smuggling operation? Child labor factory of sushi chefs? Honestly, I don't care, it tastes awesome. ",0,0,0,0,1

 My husband and I eat at restaurants about three times a week. One thing we believe is that if the food is so-so but the service is good, it makes an enjoyable time. But, if the food is good and your service is awful, the entire experience is ruined. This is what happened to us last night. We took my husbands parent to Hyde Park for a special occasion. We had drinks, wine, appetizers, salads, filets and even had after dinner drinks which were all very good, it just took our server forever to take our order, ask how everything was and we had empty plates in front of us and needed refills on our cocktails for over 15 minutes. All in all, the food was good but the service was AWFUL! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I was a client here 4 years. I feel pretty sad/a bit guilty for this review, as I liked my stylist so very much .....sweetest person ever (will not use her name). However, over time - my cuts were hurried and sloppy. My hair was lifeless and had no shape. I blamed menopausal hair. I finally did something outrageous. While I was in Orange County, I went back to my former stylist - in SoCal. Suddenly, my hair looked thick and bouncy.....the cut fell into shape without having to force it and over-style. And I was getting compliments daily - both from people I knew and strangers who wanted to know who did my hair. So, I waited 3 months before I went back in to Aspire and had to confess that my former stylist had done my hair. I asked that she ""follow the lines"" of the cut and just trim/shape it. I pointed out what I liked about it.....letting the bangs grow out, for example. Well, it took her less than 20 minutes to destroy that cut......even my bangs ""returned."" I paid, I tipped. I calmly went home to work on it for about a week - just get used to it - give it a chance. I got more and more frustrated. It was limp, had no definition and had to be forced into any style. (My hair styles easily if properly cut). . I didn't have the energy to be angry. I was just tired of this. I called Goldy and told her Im not one of those clients that freaks out over a bad cut, but I needed to ask her to refer me to someone in the shop ""who is a really talented, experienced cutter."" Stylists excel at different things. Goldy made glowing remarks about Jamie, and I made an appt. Halfway through the cut, Jamie informed me she had only been at the salon for 3 weeks and is from Chicago! Now, Goldy had been on vacation for 2 of those weeks. How could she possibly refer her work in this instance? Jamie did more random texturizing and I could see the layers getting shorter, thinner.....with the top layer looking thick and round. (She blamed it on the previous cut).. I had to ask her to stop using the thinning scissors. When she attempted to style, she used 5 products in an attempt to get some sort of shape. My hair felt gummy to the point I had to wash it that night. I did not over- react. I paid for the cut and tipped her, I emailed Goldy regarding the problem and she offered to refund my money. At that point, i was just another ""problem client"" to her. She missed the issue. As a professional in business, I felt she betrayed her clients' needs. I did ask her ""what were you thinking when you referred a brand new stylist you had not observed for a period of time?"" She did not reply to my email at all. To make matters worse : Let me add that emotional ""spite"" has no place in business. My sister had moved here a year ago and having tried my stylist was also displeased. However, she saw an Aspire client whose hair she liked very much and made an appointment with that person's stylist. When Goldy realized who my sister was ......my sister received a call canceling HER appt!! I will add that at no time was I rude, raise my voice, swear, or discuss my issues in public in front of clients or other stylists. I handled it privately and would not accept a refund because the stylists offered me their time and services as best they could. I will say my hair has been cut twice since this incident....by my former stylist, who,btw, was never hateful or critical of any other stylist. He did point out that texturizing is a precise, time-consuming method. I notice he snips at the hair carefully when texturizing. He doesn't whack at it with the full blade of the scissors in random motions......leaving long, thin feathery tails. As I said - my Aspire cut was done in 20 minutes....I watched the time. My cut in Newport Beach? 1 hour, 20 minutes. And it looks fabulous. ",0,1,0,0,0

 When I walked in and told an employee that I had an appointment, she asked, ""Are you sure you called THIS salon?"" Puzzled as to why she asked me that, I said, ""yes,"" and she asked me to wait for my manicurist to arrive. The girl I spoke to in person even sounded like the same girl I made the appointment with over the phone. Seemed odd. My manicurist, the owner, was 15 minutes late for my appointment, with no apology or consideration for my time. She was very arrogant with me AND her employees. I usually plan on my nails taking an hour, however this manicure took even longer. She either couldn't multi-task or didn't care to, but while she told stories to her coworkers, she'd stop working on my nails to talk. She criticized how horrible my nails looked, hence why I was at a salon to get them done. She said, ""You wan square, right?"" I responded by saying no. She filed my nails and then asked if the length and shape were ok (square) and I asked her to make them shorter and with a more rounded shape, not square! She literally laughed and said that was not possible. Dumb-founded by her answer and reaction, I said, ""Then why ask what I want?"" When I handed her my credit card to pay she told me the credit card machine didn't work. I told her that's all I had. It was suggested I go to an ATM. I was paying with an actual credit card. They attempted to run it and it worked. Was that their sketchy way to convince me to pay in cash? Another customer paid with a card right after me and that card worked as well! When I left, I had to say good bye and thank you twice before all the employees stopped talking to each other to say goodbye back. Overall, the manicure was good but the experience will not bring me back again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Sexy space with glorified bar food, premium cocktails and a sceney Scottsdale crowd. Fun bathrooms (and I mean fun in a clean way...), a changing art showpiece and the overly-conscious fashionable crowd make for some fascinating gawking. It's usually loud and crowded esp. Thursday - Saturday nights, and finding the greeter/host(ess) is always an annoying toss-up. Do you check in out in the front patio, or in the bar entrance? You NEVER really know until you find yourself having to flag someone down. Service is expectedly so-so. Food is decent. I usually get the 7353 club sandwich with chicken bacon and avocado - very delish. And waffle fries? Yum. Drinks are pricey but done well. Fancy martinis are upwards of $13... ",0,0,1,0,0

 With spring break and spring training in Phoenix this week, many of my favorite restaurants were completely booked. After calling about ten different restaurants only to hear there were no reservations until after 9pm, I decided to give this place a try. I had heard great reviews of this new restaurant. There was no wait when we arrived and we were able to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather on the patio. The menu had a lot of great sounding items and our server recommended the Osso Bucco and the Short Ribs. I decided on the chopped salad to start and the Short Ribs for my entree. Both dishes were very good. My companion tried the Osso Bucco which was not as tasty as my dish and seemed to be lacking in the amount of meat for the price. My son tried the kid's sliders which also were very tasty. And last but not least, we finished the meal with the chocolate cake which was delicious. The service was highly attentive although the food took way to long to come out (they were not busy at all). Also, the food seems to be a bit overpriced. Overall, we enjoyed our meal and will probably be back. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Went this past weekend because we wanted to see what a Michelin star restaurant tasted like. Frankly, I was left with the impression that it's just overpriced. I've had better meals for 2 people with wine where the total was $200-$250. Because of the exorbitant price, I had to drop this rating from 4 stars to 3 stars. Service was excellent. The only table with really good views of the Bellagio fountains are 4 tops. The fois gras was good, but didn't blow my mind. Langoustine was okay. Wagyu was excellent, although it had to be sent back because it was initially overcooked. Duck was unevenly cooked so some slices were perfect while others were tough. Grand marnier souffl \ u00e9 was the best souffl \ u00e9 I've ever had. So light and fluffy. Appreciated the sugary crust on top. The chocolate ball was cool, but the flavor of the chocolate was a bit odd to me... All in all, I won't be back. But if you have the dough to throw around, give it a try. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Very disappointing meal, especially since everything up to the entree was really good. They start you off with the bread basket which comes with this bowl of ""relish,"" garlic cloves, tomatoes and basil marinating in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. First impression was ""wow, this is really good!"" Then we ordered stuffed mushrooms which were 3 huge mushroom caps stuffed with sausage and spinach, tasty! Salad was salad, but still good. Then came the main course, Hubby ordered fettuccine alfredo with shrimp and I ordered the pomodoro. While his dish looked appetizing my looked like a can of crushed tomatoes had been plopped ontop of angel hair pasta. Both dishes lacked flavor and was so bad we asked for both to be packed up after only two bites. The carryout containers were soon dumped into the nearest trash can once we left the resturant. The Southpoint resturants are hit or miss. We liked the Silverrado Steakhouse and Primely primerib, while we really didn't care for the mexican resturant or the buffet. We'll be adding Don Vito's to the ""will not come again"" list ",0,1,0,0,0

 I tried a different pizza (The Egg Pizza, with prosciutto and an egg) and was quite pleased. Sad to discover the CFL lights extend to the main seating area, and they need some music - it wasn't as busy as I'd like to see, and so it got a little quiet, which is a bit of a mood-killer.

 I will NEVER buy another Ford ever, everything you hear about Fords are true. I have had my Ford Mustang V6 since 2006 (2006 model). Every month it was something new that was wrong with it.. mechanical and electronically. So this Monday my car was back at the service department for a fuel pump sensor. They called and quoted me over $500 for a $30 part. No thanks, so i paid the $120 for them to go throughout my car to see if anything else was wrong with it. Final report: new brake pads =$400, fine. NOTHING else was said on the paper work, NOTHING. Flash forward two days, 10 pm at night driving 70 mph in the fast lane on the 95. My right front tire sounds like is about to fall off.. so i pull off the freeway (going 10 mph) to see if i had a flat. My boyfriends father comes to my rescue since he used to work at the speedway. My tire had RIPPED IN HALF!!! The metal braiding inside of it was wrapped around my rim. Come to find out ALL 4 of my tires were COMPLETELY bald! $600 later for new tires... My question is: HOW COULD THEY NOT HAVE TOLD ME???? I paid them $120 for what! And on top of that i could have been killed if i did not stop right away when i heard the noise (quoting the tow driver). I would never ever let this company touch a car again! The next day i finally got rid of my mustang, such a beautiful car but not worth the money or my life. I got a 2012 new honda because at lease i know that i have a dependable, safe car now. Oh and wait for my call on Monday morning because you can bet i will chew someones head off (*cough* service department!!). ",1,0,0,0,0

 I've been coming to this theater for years and have been a few times since they remodeled and changed concept. Most recently was a few weekends ago to see Gravity... The seats are comfortable enough, and I don't really mind the concept of dine and watch a movie - but then again, maybe I do. I've been to a few other theaters with this format, and I guess I find it kind of distracting and annoying with waiters wandering around. I mean, it has its pluses and minuses. The food here is okay. In no way is it worth the price you pay, but it's also pretty absurd that regular cheap ass candy is just as expensive here as anywhere else (as others have pointed out), and when proposed next to their ""fancy"" desserts, the price of a box of Dots is ridiculous. So I get that people make mistakes and everyone has a bad day and all that, but while sitting and trying to watch the movie, the waiter carrying a bag of popcorn to someone behind me dumps the entire thing on my lap, and in my drink and all over my pizza. I don't mind so much... I'm just trying to watch Sandra Bullock float in space. However, he apologizes profusely and asks me what I was eating and drinking... I said ""pizza and a coke zero."" He takes my food and drink away and says he'll bring me replacements. He leaves me covered in popcorn shrapnel. Half an hour later, I get a replacement pizza... still no drink. I ask him again for a Diet Coke or Zero... about 15 minutes later, someone else hands me a Coke. Nope. Then another guy comes by and sweeps around me. All of this is REALLY fucking distracting while trying to watch a film. I ask someone else for a Coke Zero or Diet Coke... eventually, I get it. Then later, the guy bugs me again to give me a bag of popcorn ""on the house"" - uhh... thanks, but if I wanted popcorn, I would've ordered some in the first place. I get it though - nice gesture. I didn't eat any of it. Then the bill comes and the movie is over. The bill has 2 pizzas on it. I'm like, ""WTF!?"" I didn't even ask for a replacement pizza! We sit around waiting for someone to come by and nothing... I get up and go to find my waiter guy and he's disappeared. A girl who may have been a manager asks me what's up and I unload on her all of the anger and rage I had apparently stored up combined with all the tension and intensity created by the film I had just watched. She took my bill and said she would remove a pizza... then came back and said to just go ahead and leave without paying because their credit card machines were down. I gave her whatever cash I had on me and split... on the ride home, I decided that was dumb because she probably just pocketed it. Then I figured she probably earned it for listening to me say fuck a bunch of times loudly. Then I went back to wishing I had just left. They should've offered me my ticket(s) back and comped my drink and removed the extra pizza and apologized... or maybe offered passes to another show. They could've handled it way better than they did. I mean, spilling popcorn on me isn't even a big deal at all - they just kept making it worse and worse. As it stands, I probably won't be back. And Gravity was fucking top! It was so amazing, though I probably need to see it again without a bunch of bullshit going on around me. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This was my first Cirque Du Soleil show I've ever been too, and I have to say, ""IT WAS AMAZING!"" The way they incorporate certain angles and transitional scenes make you believe you're actually watching a CGI movie, but it's real life! You can't understand a word the performers are saying, it sounds like SIMS talking back and forth, but you can pretty much understand the story line just by watching which makes this show appropriate for any cultural background. The performers knew what they were doing, and the show was spectacular. They had martial arts, acrobatics, and even a kind of funny circus like quality in a few scenes. The scenes were beautiful : ) I would highly recommend this show especially if you like more Asian cinema then this would be the Cirque Du Soleil for you :D ",0,0,0,1,0

 I stopped into this shop for free comic book day the other day. I'm not a fan, really...this shop is tiny, with a very small selection of comics, and doesn't seem to be as well kept as some other shops I enjoy. They didn't have the comic that I wanted (to buy, not for Free Comic Book Day...that selection was pretty bad, but it WAS late in the afternoon, I'm sure the better selection was taken in the morning...that does not factor into my rating at all.), so we ended up picking up a ""Death of Wolverine"" comic, but it wasn't what I wanted.

 ""So you paid 75.00 for a room and aren't happy? Is that what you're bitching about?"" This is not a review of The Signature hotel which was amazing but of Jet Luxury Resorts services at the signature who own a portion of the rooms there via their timeshare program. We bought a Jet Luxury resorts deal via travelzoo.com. We paid 99 bucks a night plus tax and resort fees and stayed the weekend of 5/31/13 to 6/2/13. So, I am thinking MGM Signature hotel, great deal....what can go wrong? I book two rooms and let Jet resort know we are a family. Fine, yes, we will accommodate they say. Fast forward two months we get to the Signature property and check in. I am told that our family will be in two separate towers. Floors I could have worked with but towers? I explain to the amazing Signature representative Stephanie who helped us that we needed to be in the same tower because we were a family with a baby and a senior and it would just be far more practical. She said that because our reservations were made via Jet we would have to call them to make any changes. I was given the number and called Jet resorts ""Josh"" picked up. I asked him if we could please be in the same tower he said he could not made it happen, I explained to him my dilemma and mentioned to him that my original request was have rooms on the same floor. He said that they made the reservations a long time ago and it would not be possible. He then said he could cancel the reservation at that very moment and I could look for something in Vegas that ""worked"" for me. I told him I was standing in the lobby of the hotel and that was not realistic. His response? ""So you paid 75.00 for a room and aren't happy? Is that what you're bitching about? I'll accept your apology for that"". I told him where he could go and hung up on him. Here is the thing...we paid 550.00 for two rooms for two nights, yes it was a deal but never did I buy the verbal ABUSE and the douche-bag Josh with the deal. Who talks to people that way? I guess Jet Resort Reps do. I got off the phone and the signature resort rep was so apologetic and genuinely trying to ease my shaking nerves. I will never use this company again....I wish I would have logged in and read the bad reviews here because it would have thought twice about using a vendor and not the actual hotel...I recommend you stay clear of them. However, the Signature Hotel itself is a great hotel and will book directly through them. I am planning on reporting Josh to the Jet Management as well as the MGM Management Staff. 0 stars for Josh the Jet Resort Douche-bag, 5 for the actual Signature Hotel and 10 stars for Stephanie the beyond kind and professional service rep.

 The food is consistently phenomenal here. There are plenty of vegetarian options (meat as well) and all the vegetarian food is also vegan. It is a family-owned place I think, and cozy. At least one of the servers seems totally depressed to be there. I think she resents it when you need something -- my main reason for only 4 stars. We just love eating here!

 Let me start by saying the staff was able to deal with problems, but there were problems. Some seats can be awkward. One row of tables stare at the waiter prep station, another at a blank wall. The big issues is that you may not actually be able to get Stone Crabs here at Joe's Stone Crabs. A combination of the oil spill in the gulf, a bad crab season and that the original Joe's in Miami (this isn't, its a distant partnership) hoardes the crabs means they may be out. Their ""Steak and Stone Crabs"" (which is why I went) is on the menu but not being served. The evening I was there they were out of every Stone Crab size EXCEPT the two most expensive ones so call ahead. As a big Lettuce Entertain you fan (20 years now) I was surprised. Food-wise the grilled corn, creamed spinach, and the key-lime pie were definite highlights and the good news is that NOT even BP or a poorly written service level agreement with the original Joe's Stone Crab can stop those from being available.

 Winner for biggest hot dog in town? Maybe. Sirens, bells, flashing lights and yelling servers. And it's all for me because I've ordered the ""big unit"". Can't make this a review to take seriously, mostly just a blog entry as I've only been there a few times. Last night I chose this place for its proximity to the Bentley Gallery where I saw a wonderful chamber music concert. I did order the big unit. My dining buddies were in awe at its size. Even the 2-foot bun wasn't long enough to contain the dog: it pokes out both ends and over the edge of the restaurant-chafing-dish-size stainless steel tureen. I ordered it loaded with chili and cheese and onions on the side. Dog on one side, fries on the other. Take your iPhone because you must get a panoramic shot of yourself holding up the gigantic deep-dish container, mouth open wide. Ask for my facebook if you want to see it -- it's truly vulgar. The dog is all-beef. About halfway through your server will ask if you want a box. A testament to my voracious appetite (and my companions' desire to graze) we gracefully declined. One by one, those fries disappeared, and slice by slice, we could have counted up the multiple dozens of grams of sodium ingested. Unfortunately the bun was that processed brown ""wheat"" spongy thing with a slightly rough but still squishy crust. Would have preferred a roll with more substance, perhaps toasty. Or they could have gone the extreme with the wonder-bread just-better-than-twinkies airy squish that Sonic uses for their coneys. It soaked up too much of the cheese and chili sauce. Chili beans were the downfall for me. Must have had corn syrup for sweetner or starch for thickner, 'cause I paid for it later (corn allergy). Every so often I have to be baad and hope for the best while I wait for the worst. I'll eventually learn I just can't eat this stuff any more. Perhaps this little blog will get it out of my system. All in all, I can only compare it to the standard set by Sonic. Of course, the best one is on pier39 or back east, depending upon your preferences. Limited beers on tap, but they had Kiltlifter, so I was happy. It's a diner with flair. How can I get the big-gunned black-t-shirted waiter dudes wearing make-up to call me ""sugar""?

 Being from New York City, I would think that finding better Pho in Canada is hard to fathom but I have been swayed after this trip. With dinner plans at Europea falling through, we decided to stay within walking distance of our hotel. Located on a block with 4 other Pho restaurants, we decided on this one based on its decor and the less mom and pop aesthetic. Sitting across from the exposed stone wall, we had cushy leather seats that looked deceptively stone-like themselves adding to the cohesion. Our host/waiter was very friendly and provided recommendations to suite our cravings. We started with a mango salad, which was fresh, spiced and seasoned very well. Then we followed it with an order of 4 chicken wings. Hands down one of the best wing I've eaten. It was very tender and juicy with a great crispy crunch without being hard or greasy. We each had the vermicelli bowl with grilled pork and bean sprouts. Although tasty, there wasn't anything exceptional here. Anytime you can walk into a Vietnamese place and not be gliding across its greasy floors, you'd wonder if it was authentic. This place sets a new standard where great Vietnamese food can be had with a chic ambiance. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Salon: My star rating was based on the salon My friend had a gift card for the Four Seasons so during our trip to Scottsdale, we decided to use it at the Salon to get our nails done. We got an appointment on Saturday morning, I called beforehand to make sure they have gel/shellac manicures available. I sat in a weak massage chair, but enjoyed the warm neck pillow she placed around me. I asked if she could do a french manicure and she hesitated but said yes. As she was putting my hands in the UV, I noticed that the white polish was starting to bubble at the tips, I pointed it out to her and she said that's happened before, I assume its because there was air flowing through the UV lamps, which I've never experienced before. Once the last coat was on and under the light, it was time for the salt scrub. I was excited at the thought that I would get my hands and arms scrubbed, but disappointed when she asked me to do it myself and then she spent about 30 seconds rubbing my hands. No lotion, no massage, nothing. My friend was still getting her nails done so I left to go use the sauna. ONE DAY LATER, my at least $105 manicure (It was $85 for the gel and another $20 for the french!!) started PEELING UP!!! It's now been 4 days and I've had 4 fingers start peeling and was able to just peel the entire gel polish. I pay $40 in Santa Barbara and it lasts up to 3 weeks! For paying over $100, this manicure was worthless. Pool: My friend and I mentioned to our manicurists about wanting to go to the pool there and they said that we couldn't because the pool was only open to spa guests. We were disappointed as we wanted to spend the afternoon there and thought the salon counted. We went into the well stocked locker room and changed into our suits anyways and went to check it out. Whoa! We walked right in without needing a key card. No one asked us anything as we found a couple lounge chairs and laid out. The friendly poolside staff, brought us a pitcher of water and towels. We ordered lunch a couple hours later, and when they asked our room number, we told him we were guests of the spa and were going to pay cash. We had the chicken panini and jalapeno hummus. They were both great! Throughout the afternoon the poolside staff brought treats for everyone including rice crispy treats, dibs ice cream and otter pops! Perfect things for a hot day. ",0,1,0,0,0

 OK, so I don't usually shop at this type of store just because it takes so much time to look through the racks to find what you want and/or a good deal. I think the trick is that you can't go in there with something in mind; you just have to go in there and see what you find. I was looking for capri pants in the off-season, and had been to Ross and TJ Maxx prior to going into Marshalls. I had zero luck at either of the other stores. At least I was able to find some capris, and for a good price at Marshalls. But I'm picky and the styles just weren't what I was looking for so I walked out empty-handed. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Went here for dinner on a friday night with three girlfriends. DELICIOUS! It's a little pricey, but the food was fantastic. We ordered apps, entrees, desserts and brought wine. There is a cork fee which isn't great, but I wasn't too bothered. My only complaint is that the restaurant closed at 10pm on a Friday night. They let us linger for a bit since we didn't get a table until 8:30 and we brought a lot of wine. We would've stayed longer, but they started cleaning up around us and it felt like we should go. The restaurant is cute and cozy, it would be perfect for a date night. I've heard good things about brunch, planning to try it soon! ",0,0,0,1,0

 We enjoyed the atmosphere (semi outdoor dining) and the sustainable ecosystem here. They grow their own produce and have a behive on the roof to pollinate their own plants! I loved the organic feeling of it all. We tried several items: pizza appetizer (yum), Lake Erie Grouper (yum), veggie burger (decent). The drinks were unique. I didn't enjoy the Pink Lemonade cocktail - the description led me to believe there would be pureed raspberries but the drink tasted poor and syrupy. I also tried the gin and tonic and found the gin to be too zingy for my taste (something local, I believe). Beers were consistent. This is a great location, a cool vibe, but the drinks and food were fine, just nothing above average. ",0,0,1,0,0

 By far the most unique stop for any visit to Pittsburgh. You have to get a Whaler (1/2 pound of whiting or cod fried and heaping over the bread of your choice.

 Lost points for a couple reasons. Took a group there for lunch and 3 of us ordered iced green tea, only to find out that the tea was not brewed yet and it would take a while. So we ended up ordering bottled water. Then 3 of the 6 ordered the pork dish, only to find out they are out of pork. So they get teriyaki. My ramen was tasty and the kimchee fried rice was great.

 I first went to the Taphouse Kitchen to.check out what I heard to be an amazing nosh and mingle place. It was everything I expected, warm and inviting. Really kind staff and everything is made from scratch. I had the delicious wings! A great blend of spices and a touch of sweet. It took me two weeks to return....nearly going to go to a nearby restaurant, we luckily went in for the amazing brunch. The Brioche french toast is the most amazing thing in the world.. my mouth waters...thinking about it.. the eggs benedict was also spectacular, roasted turkey on sourdough with a crazy delicious guacamole with bits of bacon mixed in... omggg wow.. Its deadly good. You get the idea! Its worth every penny! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I'm all for branching outside the ""American Food"" comfort box. But when I tried this place I honestly didn't like it. First off the place does not accept debit cards...it's 2014 people. Second the sandwich was not good. I had the chicken sandwich. The meat had a weird flavor and aftertaste and the bread was pretty hard. The pickled vegetables weren't good either. The sandwich itself wasn't cold or hot it was just kinda lukewarm. Overall I don't approve. I don't see myself ever going back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 What a great idea! Okay, I've been to other airports that combine rental car companies into one location. But for some reason, VEGAS does it better. Hop into any of the appropriate shuttle at the airport and they'll bring you here--about a 5 minute ride. I didn't have to call my individual rental company, nor wait for an individual shuttle. This place is so clean! Note that I don't love all the rental agencies here, I like the fact they're in one location. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Actual wait: 20 min., told to wait: 35 min. My boyfriend and I crashed brunch here (wouldn't take reservations) on MOTHER'S DAY, and thought we would be waiting forever, but the kitchen and wait staff were completely prepared for the extra crowd. All women were given free mimosas (as many as we wanted), and mini champagne macaroons from the bakery (with the check). They definitely did not hold back on the booze in the mimosas. Price: I expected to pay at least $100-$150. It was less than $80 before tip (for two people, ordering enough food for 3 or 4 people) Food: We ordered a cheese sampler with bread and honey comb and preserves, quiche with salad, pancakes with strawberries and vanilla butter and creme, and crab Benedict with peas,mushrooms, and crispy, cube potatoes. Let's not mention the little bread clusters with butter and peach compote, the tea carafe, and free mimosas. Pretty much the best breakfast ever, but I had some trouble choosing until our waiter told about the egg Benedict special. ",0,0,0,0,1

 You can't come to Vegas and not see the dancing water, common! The fountains are lovely. It's a spectacle. It's awe-inspiring, it's marvellous, wonderful, stunning! Is that enough adjectives now? Seriously, I'm being legit - it's the absolute dog's bollocks as Londoners say. The water shoots up to insane lengths, the fountain dances to well known tunes, there's such a long pavement in front of the fountains that you're bound to get a place to stand and enjoy.

 Save your $$$$!!! We came here this past Sunday night for their famous Frozen Hot Chocolate. If you don't know what it is, it's just a Chocolate Milkshake....without the ice cream. We waited in line for 10 minutes just to place our order. Here's why...there was one girl taking orders....and the SAME girl making the drinks! Now after placing our order, apparently, workers inside saw the huge line building up outside the ""take-out"" window, and one extra person decided to help out. Funny, because through the pick-up window, we could hear him talking $hit about the girl (the one taking orders) with another co-worker! After all this $hit talking, our drink was ready. For $15 (for a double), this is EXTREMELY overpriced!! And I do mean EXTREMELY!!! I'm not 100% sure, but I'm pretty sure there isn't supposed to be ice chunks in it. I was basically chewing my drink. WTF??!?! If you're looking for a frozen drink, I'd suggest going to Starbucks and getting a Frappacino....or better yet, go to Coffee Bean and get one of their blended drinks. Granted, it will be more expensive than your local SB or CB, but it'll still be cheaper, faster, and more importantly, TASTIER! Avoid this place! If you really want to try one, I'd suggest stopping by one of their locations in NYC. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Poke Express (here and the North location) is one of my favorite spots for some seafood. This is in a odd attachment to Island plate counter and Island Sushi. I normally want rice with my poke so this being with a plate counter is a plus. I can get a side of rice here and sit down whereas the other location I normally walk over to closeby Hawaiian place for rice and to sit or take it home. My favorite is the kimchee poke. It's not really spicy, but more like the flavor of kimchee. For something more classic, I favor the limu poke. Not sure what to get? Feel free to ask questions and ask for samples. Nom! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I came here last night (Saturday) for dinner with a group of 7. The guys in the group said the specialty was their prime rib and so we all had that except for one person in our party. That one person had steak and while it looked good, the prime rib tasted better according to another friend. Each prime rib dish includes some of their 'famous spinning salad', mashed potatoes, and bread. The spinning salad in my opinion was less than great. Salad drenched in thousand island dressing ... hmm. It's cool how they toss the salad but as far as taste goes, it's 'ok'. Next, the prime rib? I was expecting something amazing ... and it was not. For one, my sis ordered hers well done and I ordered mine medium well. Yet my sisters was redder than mine... and I guess the waiter overheard our table surveying which looked more well done because he switched it up for something way darker. The bread it comes with, yorkshire? Or something like that, it's pretty good. We added some lobster tails, they weren't bad but again we've had better. Based on other reviews, I was expecting the service to be superb, something along the lines of a Ruth's Chris. However, I felt the service was lacking. A bit slow and the waiter kept bringing me diet coke instead of regular, after I asked him specifically for a refill of regular coke, since it seemed he was overwhelmed and didn't take notice of things like refills. It actually wasn't even busy. We had stopped at the bar before being seated and the drinks were pretty good. We tried a raspberry mojito, yum! Overall, an 'okay' experience. I wouldn't return. Also, if you call ahead for reservations, be prepared to give them your name and credit card number. I thought it was weird but that's their policy. The only good thing is that they advise you of the suggested 18% gratuity and you can let them know at that time you prefer they not include that and they won't. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Pure was an ok experience for me in the beginning of the night. I went to Pure in April of 2008 because we were stopped by a guy on the strip who offered to try to get us in without waiting. It was our last night in Vegas so we thought ""What the heck.. may as well"". The host did his job and got us past the entire mob of people. And when I say mob... I mean I couldn't even tell where the line was.. It was pretty ridiculous and somewhat unorganized... So we get in and the place is still somewhat empty because it's only about 11:30 Pm and a hundreds of people are still waiting to get in. The place was beautiful. It was just like the pictures you see on the website.. (You know the pictures of the venue that you'll never know reflected the actual club because by the time it's packed, you can't see one piece of the decor). White drapes, pink, purple and blue lighting. Dropped by the bar and paid a ridiculous 20 bucks for a freakin vodka redbull (18 + 2 for a tip). I was so disgusted by the price, i decided to have a double on the next one, lol. So as the night progresses, we walk around, and take a trip up to the roof and you get a beautiful view of the strip and there's a perfect breeze.. But I swear it was like 70% male on the roof, cuz all of them got bottle service up there.. What a rip... pay top dollars just to see a bunch of fellas.. By the time I get down to the main floor, it's startin to pick up and we decide to visit the Pussycat Dolls Lounge (pussycat doll lounge is a small room in Pure which has performances by the females, singing, dancing, etc.). It cost $5.00 to get into the lounge and it was free for women. I couldn't believe how many guys in the club were cheap skates to get in this extra portion. It was less packed and it had a much better girl to guy ratio. Had fun in there and met a few girls who seemed to be very talkative. Danced with one group of gals, having a good time so far. Finally I decide to go out to the main floor with my buddy (1:30ish), and it was the worst shoulder to shoulder crammed piece of crap I've ever seen. It was hot, stanky, nasty and everybody looked frustrated or pissed off cuz they didn't have enough room to dance, didn't have enough room to walk over to the bar, didn't have enough room to move in general. This is what turned me off the most about the club. People were sweating profusely from the lack of air and the slight scent of vomit was circulating. From that point on, my buddy and I went back to the PussyCat Doll Lounge and remained there. Pure had its good moments. But overall, it was just a mediocre experience. So let's put it this way. Pure better than Jet Pure not as good as Tao XS rips them all into shreds. If you would like to know more. Check out my review on XS. Take care folks! ",0,0,1,0,0

 My husband loves Sportsmans. Its probably the best little specialty beer and wine shop in Phoenix. The staff couldn't be more friendly - it absolutely adds to the experience. The bar is perfect for an easy post-work drink with co-workers or friends. Great selection of wine and beer (obviously) at reasonable prices. They also have some quick and easy food for snacking on. I think I liked it better pre-remodel. They could dim the lights a bit and add a better musical soundtrack during happy hour but overall a great neighborhood spot. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Not too sure how to think about this place yet. But i'll tell you about the 3 things I got. Cabeza Taco - AMAZING. rich, smooth, and with the cut of the salsa from the salsa bar, really how you want one of these bad boys to taste! Chorizo Taco - sorta dry, which despite how rich i'm sure the meat was is a bit shocking. Al Pastor Torta - really quite terrible. The whole thing was dry and the pastor was bland. There wasn't any mayo or cheese in there to moisten it up and as a restaurant, that based on it's various graphics bills itself as a pastor joint you'd think they'd be able to do better. I guess maybe the should advertise with pictures of cabeza? probably not because cabeza looks sorta gnarly but lawwwd its' good ",0,1,0,0,0

 My son and I stopped by China Gate after a movie in the Galleria. We had eaten there before when it was called Mark Pi's China Gate. The food was very good. I think it's changed hands and here's why. We were seated and given menus. We placed our order with the waiter and not less than 3 minutes later, ALL of our food was brought out. I was shocked. There was no way this order was prepared and cooked that fast. My son took one bite, I didn't even bother, and we called the waiter back over. I told her I expected fresh food, not some hidden buffet that had been sitting out. I got up to leave and she called the manager who tried to force me to pay. I refused. I will never go back.

 I love Gordon Ramsey on TV and never had any of his food. Since he has like 5 places in Vegas, we decided to check out one of less expensive ones. I ordered the meatless mushroom burger, my mom had a classic cheeseburger. They don't serve their burgers with ketchup and let me tell you, the cheeseburger does not need any condiments. The burger was cooked perfectly, the lettuce was crisp, the tomato wasn't soggy, the bun was grilled and buttered nicely. You could taste the quality meat and the fat that they cook with and that flavor was fantastic. I loved my mushroom burger... I thought there was too much bread though because it doesn't have the same height as a meat burger. We didn't get any fries or sides and we didn't need any. I would love to try another burger there, something I wouldn't normally try. The wait is long... It's vegas... I don't give them a knock for that but the food takes a long time to get.

 Caffe e Cucina opened not too long ago (and conveniently just across the road from our flat) in what used to be Loopy Lorna's, and is a better place by far to my mind! Tasty food, a welcoming atmosphere, and conveniently late hours make for an enthusiastic thumbs-up. We've visited twice now- once for breakfast, once for lunch, and loved it both times. The decor makes for a warm atmosphere, helped by the friendly staff, and the food doesn't disappoint. The veggie Eggs Benedict (with spinach) is a well made and tasty alternative to the usual Scottish brekkie- though they have that too. The cherry tomato and rocket linguine made for a hearty lunch - if a little heavy on the oil for my taste. My girlfriend had the pan-fried sea-bass, and tells me it was great, and perfectly cooked. Highly recommended, and a great place for lunch if you're in Morningside- especially if you're visiting Henri's French deli across the road. ",0,0,0,1,0

 If you're staying at MGM, NyNy or anywhere around there, just go here for at least breakfast! We all know that Vegas is a tourist trap and can get expensive. Save your money for the gambling, clubs, drinks and the nice nights out and grab breakfast or lunch here. Surprisingly extremely fresh food for ""what you should expect"" prices. Fix your hangover with a short walk out of your hotel and grub out, and head RIGHT NEXT DOOR!!! to the liquor store to grab your pregame/to-go drinks for the day. So happy I saw this place out of my hotel window and decided to try it. Between Coco's and the convenient liquor store next door, had to save us $80-$100+ for a 4 night stay.

 Beauty Bar. Just hearing that name makes me wanna punch a baby. This place charges a cover for starters. Are you kidding me? This bar is located on Fremont Street downtown (the only part of Vegas with real character, personality, and culture). People go downtown because it's cheap, laid back, and it's full of misfits.

That table had been trying to flag her down to tell her there was something wrong with their food. It looked disgusting. That was enough for me.

 My wife and I wanted to try something different. A few days ago we went to Windsor for a birthday dinner up the street from Maizie's. We've heard there were a lot of good restaurants along Central avenue so we decided to try this place. It's a very small place. It's got a bar, a patio and a few tables. The decor was okay. Nothing really stood out to me. Our server was nice. She had good customer service skills. We got the brie and apple bruschetta. It was good. But $10 for four pieces of bread? Way too much. $8 would be more reasonable. I had their burger. Putting a burger on ciabatta bread? Freaking genius. That was good. Their sweet potato fries were good too.

Our waitress got drinks quickly but that was the only thing that happened timely. I had tomato bisque with grilled cheese (SO GOOD) and my husband had their Mac 'N Cheese burger. We waited about 10 minutes for drink refills and another 10 minutes for the check and had to flag her down for that. I think she had one other table...

 Paper and Home came recommended to us by our wedding planner. As an out-of-town couple getting married in Vegas, it was important to us to have a stationary store who not only did great work, but had great communication. Paper and Home came through for us and did a great job. We took a trip out several months before the wedding to do some planning, and Brooke sat down with us for an hour to discuss what we wanted. She showed several samples and listened to what we liked and didn't. That was the last time we saw Brooke in person, but we had consistent communication with her team via email after that.

Everyone is squeezed in together tightly. The host takes your coats and hangs it up and we sat in a small booth for five. Dinner menu was written on a chalkboard wall that was barely legible. Our waitress was easy on the eye. She was beautiful so when she informed us we only had two hours for drinks, appetizer, dinner and deserts we all just agreed to the rules and nodded our heads. Two hours later on the dot. We empty out our purses and wallets and walked out of the restaurant happy and full. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I am not Chinese, but my boyfriend is, and he says this place is close to what his family makes, so I believe him :). That said, I've had a lot of great food here. Chen-do chili chicken, eggplant, beef ho fun, stir fried bok choy and a fried melon dish are a few of my favorites. At first it can be confusing to order, and I've seen a lot of people look overwhelmed by the menu and people milling about the counter. I say: DON'T WALK OUT! Ask the lady at the register (daughter of chef) and she can help you. Highly recommend. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Love this place!! Of course, the location in NYC has much more character, but the LV location still has that whimsical feel. Brought my husband for his first Serendipity experience and he really liked it- the atmosphere and the food. I had the crab cake sandwich and he had a burger. Both were delicious! Love Serendipity 3!!! ",0,0,0,1,0

 It's so hard to find a good quality stylist that won't butcher your hair. I was browsing on Yelp for different stylists in my area bout a year ago, and I found Hair Artisans. I'm really glad I decided to give them a shot, because Danielle is amazing! Super sweet, and will always give you exactly what you want/need. I know she specializes in fixing up curly hair, but I've got long, wavy black hair, and she cuts and styles me just right. She even helped me out with some color correcting a few months ago! (I'll post some pictures) Best way to make an appointment is through hairartisans.net. I think when I first started going to them, I tried making a phone call, and no one answered. I mean, there's no receptionist or anything, so it's probably difficult to answer a phone while styling hair lol I read another review that said it was somewhat difficult to find? They're located at the District in Green Valley. Yeah, the Sola Salon set up is kinda maze-like, but they're the first studio on the left side when you come in from the parking lot (by The Cheesecake Factory parking lot), so you really don't have to go through the maze unless you're going to the restroom... which I did one time, and almost didn't find my way back lol. The studio itself is kinda small... cozy. She's always got the jams playing ;) There's three chairs and one washbowl. So pretty much at any given time, there will be 3 appointments going on. I haven't been to the other stylists, but I've seen a little bit of what they've done. Their clients have always turned out pretty great. With payment, I've always used my credit card. I think they use the Square App to charge, and you can have your receipt texted or emailed to you. Give them a shot! You won't be disappointed! Oh and FYI! I think they've changed their name to Radically Curly. Check their Instagram out for pictures of their work! ",0,0,0,0,1

 When I first came to U of I, the first things I learned were how to register for classes, how to live in the dorms, and to make sure that I try pokey sticks from Gumby's. Let me tell you that the first time I tried them, I didn't like them. I didn't think they were that special. They're really just cut up pizza bread ish slices with marinara sauce for dipping. However last year, I must've had a bad batch. I tried them again this year and they were pretty good. I also had their wings, which were good. Be careful though, because my friend ordered a pizza from them and there was a huge bug baked in with it. And they wouldn't give her a refund for it! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Sushi... Well done and served with class. Mizuya was the choice of our visiting friends. They liked to look of the restaurant and wanted to stay close to the hotel. We were seated immediately and the menu was explained, to avoid confusion in the ordering process. The server even offered to split checks, which made things very convenient . The portions were perfect, the chicken teriyaki bowl was very well prepared and the cocktail options were very interesting. The prices are about what you would expect at a resort and honestly a bit lower than we were planning for. The service was very good. There were a couple spills and some misunderstandings, but everything was handled professionally and we had a great time. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I totally get it. The promoters/owners lure you into Tao Restaurant, ply you with yummy food and drink, and then convince you that Tao Nightclub is just as upscale and well-done. Don't fall for it! Just eat the food, drink the booze, and leave! You'll have a better night for it. Tao Restaurant is amazing. I loved the decor, the service, the short wait, and of course the food. This behemoth of a restaurant does Asian fusion right. I had the Tao-tini (after my requisite dirty Grey Goose on the rocks). Fruity, strong as all hell, and delicious. My PIC and I started with the lobster wontons. Best. Dish. Ever. Next time I go back, that's all I'm ordering. We also had the lobster dumplings to start. Good. But definitely not the lobster wontons. We then ordered the Thai fish hot pot, which had a very strong sauce, overpowering on its own, but perfect with steamed rice. We made the mistake of ordering veggie fried brown rice. Why were we trying to be healthy? Anyway, what came was a plate of veggies + mush. Ugh. Panda Express makes a better fried rice than that! Upon leaving the Venetian, my PIC and I decided that next time, we're just ordering 6 servings of the lobster wontons. And then heading to Jet to shake it all off! P.S. One of my students told me that her group of friends was offered free dinner + drinks + Tao admission the same weekend. So if you have a group of 10+ cute Asian girls, you may get dinner for free! Otherwise, expect to spend about $50/person, not including drinks. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I really wanted to like Gallagher's after reading all the great reviews. I really did. Unfortunately, our dining experience was less than stellar: - My husband was not served alcohol because he left his ID in our hotel room even though my 60-year-old-plus parents vouched for his age (he's 29). We hadn't been carded the entire trip. I get that they don't want to get in trouble, but this was annoying. - It took about 30 minutes after we sat down to get bread, and we received our entrees ONE HOUR after ordering. We ordered after 8PM on a Sunday night, and they were not swamped with customers. - One of my fellow table guests asked the bread/water server for an update on our food, and he said he'd check with our server. Our server Linda consequently ignored us until our food arrived, about 15 minutes later. We tried to make eye contact with her to no avail while she was checking on other tables around us. - Several dishes were cold when we finally got them (i.e. French fries, which are never good cold). - My husband found several hairs in his food about 10 minutes after we were served. We told our server. She came over and asked if he had saved the hairs for her to see. Who saves hairs they find in their food? That's disgusting! Look on the floor where he tossed them! - The manager came by after our server told him about the hairs on my husband's plate. He too questioned my husband if he saved the hairs (um, no). The manager said, ""I'm surprised, this usually doesn't happen"" - I would certainly hope not! - Neither our server or the manager offered to get another meal for my husband (again, after waiting an hour to get our food, so we were all hungry!). They took his hairy food off the bill, but such an accusatory attitude toward a guest is awful. They were both defensive and arrogant when it came to trying to make the situation better. Overall, I was extremely disappointed. To wait an hour for food, topped off with rude staff, is unacceptable when you're spending $50+ per person on food and drinks. I work in customer service myself so I know how important it is to cater to your guests. The sad part is, it's Vegas and they don't care if you ever come back, so they could care less about keeping their customers happy. I emailed Gallagher's customer service (via their website, not New York New York's), so it will be interesting to see if I get a response back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The new process is awful. Instead of picking out your own ingredients, you are served Subway-style, which makes it less customized and MUCH less efficient. When I walked in, there was a line out the door. Once I sat down, there were no sticks to identify my bowl, and the server took quite a while to arrive, so I ended up behind a group of 12. Then the new process of communicating your ingredients to staff took much longer. Additionally, they appeared understaffed (for a Friday lunch hour? That seems like a predictable rush time), so everything took longer. (This visit was well over an hour, which seems like a long time for fastish food.) Don't plan on this place for a quick lunch stop. Most staff were friendly, with the exception of the brusque rice-serving woman who seemed annoyed at her job. (Did you want me to have food allergies? Why so upset??) I used to really enjoy FTG, much more than others like it (Hu Hot, etc.). However, I don't think I'll be recommending or returning anytime soon, especially with better, local options so nearby. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Clean rooms and grounds. However doors are very thin, closet type doors. You hear everyone's conversation especially if you're next to rude oblivious people who think they're the only one in the hotel. Nice view of the strip but comes with a price of hearing the volcano erupt every 30 mins. House keeping did not service our room, very disappointed with that. We came back from a long walk, I was expecting a tidied room for the price I paid for. We will stay elsewhere next time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Harris Teeter Ballantyne - the new lunch place! I stopped by yesterday (6/18/13) to pick up lunch to bring back to my office. Now this location has been under construction for some time so I was just expecting to pick up one of the deli's teriyaki rice bowls. Little did I expect that they would have a full set of hot lunch bars open! For $7.40 a pound (as of this date) you can get your pick of southern cuisine (chicken tenders, grilled chicken, peas, tater tots, mac-n-cheese, green beans), Asian (stir-fry, vegetable roll), Mexican (tacos, enchilada melt, rice, beans), and a full salad bar. With everything I got, it came to just under $6 - and it was a full plate! Where can you find good food takeout for under $6? Harris Teeter Ballantyne, that's where. The food was delicious - I told others in my office about it when I got back and our admin and operations manager tried it out as well. We're all going back today to try some new combos. Huge kudos to Harris Teeter Ballantyne for becoming the hot new place to pick up lunch! Oh, and the rest of the store is terrific as well - the renovations have been amazing. I've watched over several months as it has been transformed from a smaller store into an upscale mega-supermarket. They've done a great job. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This can be a pretty much all-inclusive hotel/casino in Las Vegas. You have the top LV restaurants all here, the largest casino floor in town, Ka runs here, and there are lots of places to get your drink and dance on. We stayed in both the West Wing and the regular rooms during our stay, and I preferred the regular rooms. Check-in and out here is pretty much a breeze, the rooms are very well kept and laid out, and again, the restaurants here are incredible. I thought the gaming selection was also good, and they have a really nice poker room to boot. I think this is one of the top tier 2 hotels in Las Vegas...you get much more for your $ than comparably priced tier 2 hotels in Las Vegas like TI, Monte Carlo, Paris, Mirage, etc... ",0,0,0,1,0

 Update to my previous review, went back after receiving a groupon deal and was looking forward to my usual favorite sampler appetizer platter... well surprise, things have changed! The mushrooms were different from last time, besides the fact they were served scorching hot on the outside and ice cold in the middle! The once big onion rings are now small and barely any trace of onion and the portion size in general is now much smaller. When we questioned the server he says they are having to make ""cut backs"" so I guess quality is the first thing to go. It was just very disappointing since it was our 4th time going and it was consistently good until now. I will probably give it one more chance to see if anything has changed back... very disappointing! ",0,0,1,0,0

 After reading all the reviews on this place and seeing the ""frozen hot chocolate"" mentioned in most, I decided to make a stop at Serendipity (since we had just eaten at Max Brenner in Ceasars) and get one to go. 10.00 for the frozen HC and 5.00 for a tiny bottle of evian so 15.00 later, I was sitting at an outside table ready and excited to try it. So the verdict? simply meh. It did kinda taste like a chocolate milkshake but with a more chocolaty rich flavor. Was it worth the 10.00? Absolutely not. I only got through about a quarter of it before I got tired of it, said F this and threw it away. So a few weeks later, I was talking to a friend who asked about my recent trip to Vegas. Told her I tried the frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity. She got all excited and told me she had tried it too but at Dunkin Doughnuts. We both agreed that it was good but really rich. Then I said ""I didn't feel it was worth the 10.00. I think she felt bad telling me that she had only paid... get this... 2.00 for hers! Trying to make me feel better, she insisted that mine was probably better to which I replied ""Nope, I am pretty sure they were the same."" Haha, so there you have it, even though I have not tried the one from Dunkin Doughnuts, I would say to try theirs if you really feel you must try ""frozen hot chocolate"" aka ""The more chocolaty milkshake."" No milkshake is ever worth 10.00!!! I just wish, I had come to this conclusion before basically giving my money away. Well ya live ya learn :) Note to self: When at Dunkin Doughnuts, try the Frozen Hot Chocolate to determine if it is not as good as, as good as, or better then Serendipities version. Then post the review on Yelp so others will not have the misfortune of spending too much if Dunkins is as good as or better. Keep an eye on my profile if you are interested in the results. I have a feeling this study will be conducted within the next few weeks as I have been jonsing for a chocolaty fix lately :O ",0,0,1,0,0

 I had a really dainty Betty Boop tattoo on my shoulder. I live in the desert and spend time in the sun so after a couple of years my Betty needed some touch up done. I went to Painless Wayne under the recommendation of a friend. I sat down very excited and after an extremely painful 30 minutes I was told my Betty was all fixed up. I then was told by Painless Wayne that he added fun stuff to my Betty. He told me that he had added fishnet stockings, little red hearts all around her hair and made her eyes super huge. First I think he should have asked me if he could do this and mentioned it to me before he finished. And as I said it was on my shoulder so I really could not see what he was doing because I don't have eyes in the back of my head. I really thought he was just fixing her up. He handed me the mirror and I was so swollen and red that I could not really tell the damage he had done to my Betty Boop. Needless to say many years of being unhappy and trying to cover her up and not show her off which is really hard to do considering she is on my shoulder, I decided that I would like to get a coverup tattoo. I had a consolation with a really well known GOOD tattoo artist here in town and he suggested I have some removal work done on her prior to tattooing again. I have been going to Clear Out Tattoo Removal for 2 months now and let me tell you it is very painful to have a mistake lightened up let alone removed. So far this adventure has cost me $350.00 with at least 2 more removal sessions at $100.00 to go to remove this mistake. Basically my suggestion is to make sure you know the work of the artist you go to. Not only is my work was bad but, also my boyfriend decided to have a tribal band added to his arm. This tattoo is also a mess. It has spread out and bleed through. It is nowhere as thin as when it started and we have been told by several people that it was the type of needle the tattoo artist used. I highly do NOT recommend this artist. Painless Wayne has a reputation of shady work in the industry. I only wished I had heard about it before I went to him. I would have steered clear of the shop. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I first discovered Thomas Pink a few years ago when I was graduating the first time around. It was expensive then, but that purchase is still in my wardrobe after being rediscovered, tags on (decided to wear a dress to graduation instead) when I was moving. I was in search of the perfect white shirt. I have few occasion's these days where I need to be suited and booted but it does happen. The prices are steep but you do get amazing quality shirts. I couldn't find the white shirt I wanted (I had something specific in mind and I couldn't justify spending \ u00a399 on the almost perfect shirt) but had I a different colour in mind then I would have been spoiled for choice. Thomas Pink still managed to part me from my cash as I found a gorgeous stripy shirt. If like me, you need the occasional formal shirt then the sale items are fab! My purchase was \ u00a379 originally and I paid \ u00a329 and will be great as a semi-formal or more casual piece. A great shop if you are looking for business wear that makes an impression and it is a great investment. I did look at the other shirt shops in George St, but to they weren't in the same class as Thomas Pink. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Lovely experience here tonight! Service was wonderful and was complimented by getting to meet the owner, Lindsey. She and her husband took it over from his family recently (not exactly sure when) to continue the family tradition. Food was tasty - I had pesto pasta and husband had garlic pizza plus a French onion soup and bruschetta. Atmosphere was quite nice on the patio and we enjoyed a delicious bottle of wine that was reasonably priced. We had the privilege of talking with Lindsay further and learning about their takeover after getting a summary from the menus which include an overview on key individuals in the history of Bread company, including Lindsay and the original owner, her mother in law.

 To put it shortly, rude employees, overpriced items, and misleading signs. My parents are new to the Scottsdale area - we're originally from California - and since my siblings and I are visiting for the holiday season we decided to decorate a cactus. My dad and I drove over to read their sign declaring, ""Open from 8am to 4pm everyday."" ""Everyday,"" it seems, except the days they don't feel like it. We showed up around 2:50, hopped out of the car, and started looking at the cactuses. First of all, they were quite expensive. Definitely not in our budget and, according to my parents who have now lived here for a couple months, more pricey than they've seen other places. We'd been out of the car, and surprised by the prices, for barely a minute when an employee comes rushing over, declaring (quite rudely, I might add) that they were closed. We pointed that the sign said they were open until four, and the employee gave us a vague answer, ""you know, with the rain, and uh, Christmas... Anyway, we're closed so... But we'll be open at 8am sharp tomorrow!"" Admittedly, it had been raining - but about an hour earlier! It was still a little cloudy but with no signs of future rain. And if Christmas was the reason they were closing, then why be open tomorrow? Quick side note, this is not the first time I've gone somewhere in this area only to see they have close well before the time they claim they would. Maybe it's the norm here? Still, how can people expect to get business if they're closed? Sir, you may be there at ""8am sharp"" tomorrow, but we certainly won't be. Or ever again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Best burger I have ever eaten in my life is the Shogun burger. I think that says a lot for anyone who has eating many burgers in their time living in the USA. This thing was mind blowing. All I have to say is if you have doubts of spending $26 on a burger you will quickly feel like you just got the best deal ever. The Shogun burger consists of Wagyu beef burger topped with foie gras, unagi, poached Asian pears and miso butter. AMAZING! The only negative is we ordered two burgers, the Shogun and the Kiki, and made the mistake and ate the Shogun first. The Kiki was just normal after eating that full flavored Shogun. So if you want to try something else while sharing make sure to try the Shogun last. The pork belly buns and the garlic edamame were also really good. Good eats! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Nuts! Some one beat me to writing the first review! Oh well.... But like Ruth C, I too, tried this spa out for the Spa Week Special. Cannot beat a $50 massage to begin with, let alone at a spa like this that is well appointed, spacious and new (opened in January 2010). Plus I was staying at the Embassy across the way so it was convenient. When you first walk in, you go into the coed Roman Bath, it's nice warm (not hot) pool with day beds along the sides. Then you go into the separate men/women facilities. The woman's facility has a very spacious and lounge sitting area with a large screen TV, comfy huge leather arm chairs and couches. It reminded me a study or library room with its heavy dark wood walls, leather chairs and wood tables. I was thinking the only thing missing would be a fire place! They offer complimentary fruits, granola, teas, coffe and water spiked with lemons. The bathrooms come fully stocked with curling irons, hair dryers, hairspray, mouse, gel, deodarant, razors, shave get and brushes/combs. There vanity area is pretty large and spread out so you don't feel like you're in somebody elses space. The woman's area also has it's own whirlpool, steam room and sauna. There's cold towels in ice and cold water all over the facility, in the co-ed and woman's area. The co-ed lounge area has a large flat screen on ESPN (gotta cater to the guys peppered in there with all the ladies!). and has the complimentary fruits, granola teas, etc, etc in there as well. I got this sugar cane/bamboo stick massage. My technician was professional, didn't talk too much but was friendly enough to make me feel comfortable. Rooms and ambiance are nice and warm, not huge, just enough for the table and your technician to move around. Over all, I liked this spa, I like it better than the Venetian's Spa and I'm come back. Pros: -Size of the spa and facility. It's enough to move around in and feel comfortable. I went on a Saturday at noon so I'm thinking this would be as busy as it would get as there was lots of groups but still didn't feel too crowded. -The amenities and products provided. -Clean and new -Friendly and professional staff -The ambiance of different spaces are relaxing and inviting, although not all of the same color scheme or theme. Cons: -It is the Hard Rock Hotel and it could get busy and crowded with large groups (think bachelorette parties, college co-ed) so you might want to consider when in the week you book your appt. -The hallway connecting the steam/sauna area to the showers/bathroom in the woman's facility is narrow! Only 1 woman can fit in it at time, 2 have to turn sideways to pass. Weird why they designed it like that. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The Zumanity! The Zumanity! This is an adult show of farcical sex, some natural goading, but not thoroughly erotic. The stunts come early: Girls diving into a pool, the duo tableuxing underwater. Girl in school outfit hula hooping in midair. These were the amazing parts, to me. It cools down into a vaudeville act, and there's some hysterical audience participation (one woman from Kansas was agreeably ""horny"").

 This place is great if you are looking to wash your dog by yourself. They layout for self-wash is good. The reason I am giving this place 1 star is because of my horrible experience with the groomer named Michelle. I called to inquire about grooming and was told that it includes a wash, nail trim, ear cleaning and haircut. I made my appointment 2 weeks in advance. When it was time for my appointment, I dropped my dog off and the groomer was not friendly at all. She just told me to lock my dog up in their cage. She didn't even take a second to ask me anything or talk to me since she was busy working with another dog. I left and waited, it took her 6 hours to call me back to pick my dog up. I had my friend pick up my dog since I couldn't. She paid the grooming fee plus tip. Once I saw my dog, it came to my surprise that his hair wasn't cut, nails weren't trimmed, and his left ear was super red. I called the groomer to voice my concern and instead of making it right with me, she made an excuse saying and I quote ""you should have clarified and said what you wanted done with your dog"". I then said I didn't have a chance since she made it so hard to talk to her and I did mention what I wanted when I made the appointment (plus I shouldn't have to, I was informed that the grooming package included nail trim and hair cut so that's what I expected) and her response was, again I quote ""I don't remember every appointment I book!"" how unprofessional!! Maybe you should write it down or at least be friendly enough to talk to your customers! To make matters worse, my dog got an ear infection in his left ear which cost me $60.00 to treat. It was difficult trying to put the ear drops on my dog. After the 10 day treatment, the experience left my dog scared to be touched on his head and by his ears. If you don't want to go through hell, DO NOT go here for grooming! You'll waste your money, be misinformed, not get the service you want, give trauma to your dog and be treated unprofessionally.

 My wife and I like a quality product, good prices, and exception service. We had that experience with K&J Windows. I took care of the economics. My wife was and is the arbiter of style and appearance. We had 3 vendors quote on replacing all of the windows in our 25 year old home. Anderson, Sears and K&J. Anderson and Sears presentations were similar and their prices were within 10%. Cody of K&J was a welcome exception to the other salespeople. He took the information, and sent the proposal by email two days later. No pressure. We had ALL of windows and a door replaced by K&J with a top of the line manufacturer for several thousand dollars less than Anderson/Sears quoted for doing HALF of the home. Summary- Big difference in price, same quality, and an EXCEPTIONAL installation team. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This vet has a practice of up selling services and pushing unnecessary vaccines in addition to giving too many vaccines at one visit. I recently lost my beloved Welsh Terrier, Mindy, due to the incompetence of this veterinarian. I started using them in 2009 and shortly thereafter Mindy, who was only 4 yrs. old started showing signs of fatigue when we walked her. I would have to pick her up and carry her home. The vets said she was sensitive to heat (completely normal for some dogs they said) and she had a bad hip. We discussed it numerous times and they just kept giving me pain meds. Even though she was on the health plan she went several years without blood work. She took a turn for the worse after her last checkup and multiple vaccinations. She started walking less and stopped eating when I took her in and they finally gave her a blood test. By then it was too late. She had Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia. I spent $3,000 trying to help her but she died anyway. I am very upset about losing my beloved pet when it could have been prevented. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Finally a Paradise Bakery near me! I don't have to drive all the way to Scottsdale for them anymore! No longer will my family be forced to make an adventure across the other side of town to pick up my cookie cake because I hate real cake! Right? Wrong. This Paradise Bakery just plain sucks. I still order my cookie cakes and cookies from here because it's convenient but I would never eat their food. I've tried eating here twice. Once an albacore sandwich that tasted like someone died inside of it (not the fish). The second time was just pasta salad. How do you mess up pasta salad? TELL ME. Another time my cousin ordered tomato soup and she found what we presumed to be part of a plastic spoon inside of it. How does that even happen? Are they intentionally messing with us or did they really just serve us used soup? This location is always packed. I've never come here and not had to wait in line for at least ten minutes. That and the employees (besides ONE old lady who works there) are total jerks. I'm serious. Dude you work at Paradise Bakery for a living. Don't talk down to me when I'm trying to order a cookie. I only come here to get my Mr Pibb fix or to buy my mom cookies. Their cookies are just as good as any other Paradise. I have no idea what happened to their food or who trained their employees.

 I'm a bit picky about Thai. Maybe that's why I'm so hard on Malee's. It's not traditional Thai. Which is not necessarily bad if you don't know the difference or just don't care. The food here is decent. The atmosphere is nicer than most Thai places. However, for the price, the quality of the food is a bit lacking and inconsistent. For example, I'll use my favorite Malee's dish--the seafood curry. I've ordered it 5 times and 3 x's it was great, 2x's the seafood was very over cooked and dry. At Malee's prices, that's not kosher. However, one thing I have to give them credit for is service--it's excellent. The manager is very professional, courteous and does an awesome job taking care of any mistake from the kitchen. if you want Thai in an atmosphere that's more upscale than traditional Thai restaurants, try Malee's. if you don't care and/or are a cheapskate like me, and/or desire more traditional Thai, try Thai Basil in Tempe.

 I went there this past Saturday night in a party of seven that included two kids (12 and 14). I did not know that they had valet parking as that would have been very useful on a busy uptown Saturday night. Anyway, seating was very prompt as we had a reservation. I was dressed up quite nicely but most of my party were casually dressed and no one felt uncomfortable. They do have a dress code but I understand that they are lenient. The service was just so impeccable! Prompt but not intrusive, attentive, courteous, friendly but not overly so, just top notch. Sorry I forgot our waitress name but she was very helpful in explaining the dishes so that even the kids could understand. Well the food was just outstanding also. We ordered a lot of appetizers to share and all of them were delightful. Special mention; the Pan Fried Calamari with hot peppers ( that sure didn't last long!), the creamy Mashed potatoes (the best I've ever had), the Lobster and Crab Cakes and the Lobster Mac'N' Cheese (just divinely delicious!). We also had various vegetable sides but I didn't sample many of those. For the main courses, all the adults had different steaks on the menu. Mine was the Steak au Poivre with a creamy French sounding sauce. It was beautifully tender at medium rare and spiced just right. Everyone raved about their steaks. The kids had their Chicken tenders (?) which was not on the regular menu but the waitress arranged it. The ambience was classy but not stuffy. We were not loud but pretty chatty and never felt rushed or uncomfortable. The vibe was bustling but relaxed for the guests. Only one person had dessert, everyone else were too full. The bill ( which I didn't see fortunately, thanks bro!) must have been quite high but it was well worth it. Everyone was happy, no complaints of any kind. Would absolutely go again on special occasions. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We went to lunch here and I have got to say, it was pretty gross. I ordered the asian chicken salad with shrimp. It was literally a handful of lettuce with 5 shrimp on top. They were rubbery and tasted old. We also ordered the kids fish and chips for our toddler. It was gross as well. The fries tasted like they were cooked several hours before and and had a weird after taste. Everything was pretty bad - like - didn't want to pay for it, it was so bad. With that begin said, it IS a bar. And we didn't exactly order 'bar food'. The Mister ate here before and got a burger and said it was great...so I don't know.

 So my best friend and I were trying to look for a coffee actually, and stumbled across this place and were very optimistic about trying something unknown. Bad idea. We walked in and the high schooler cashier actually rolled her eyes at us. Not sure why, but definitely was not about to leave after that. As my best friend and I were trying to decide which cupcake to share, I politely ordered a coffee. This employee's response, shocked me to a coffee lover's core as she replied, ""Uhhh, do you think you can order something else? I just don't feel like making a whole new pot if it's just one cup of coffee."" What the .... This type of service would not fly back home (Chicago), and I wish that with the poor service here, people would stop coming. I eventually ordered a Vanilla latter and my friend and I decided on the Duet cupcake. We got our cupcake and drink and were about to leave when both of them obnoxiously yelled out, ""Bye!"" in a very sarcastic tone. While the cupcake was pretty good, it was a tad pricey, and as I got home to drink my hot beverage, she had totally gotten my drink wrong. After about an hour or so, my best friend and I also began to feel really sick and had stomach aches the whole night through. They don't really care about the customer as other places here so, it is at your discretion to go if you please. Don't say you haven't been warned. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Lincoln Bakery makes very delicious donuts, pastries, and desserts. Their bread selection, however, was very limited and upon making our choice the quality of the bread was mediocre.

Still, this should be a go to for a local bakery if you are looking for something sweet. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is great when you are in the mood for something different. As with any family-run hole in the wall, service can be slow, so be prepared. What the staff lacked in speed, they made up for in charm and smiles. The food was good, but nothing that wowed me. I had the pierogis while my friend had swedish meatballs. Both dishes were tasty, as were the side dishes. One thing that was disappointing was that the food was a a little cold (lukewarm) when it came out. Maybe the chef or the staff was having an off day. The restaurant itself is bright and clean. I will go back again when I feel like eating outside the box. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I can remember my first experience with Fuel. Someone brought pizza to a rehearsal that was beyond incredible. Flavorful crust that wasn't too chewy, smartly seasoned sauce, and fresh toppings. I had to figure out where it was from...and I've been stopping in for a slice (and those addictive garlic knots!) when I'm around ever since. On my most recent visit to the Central Ave Fuel, the staff was incredibly kind and quick, especially considering it was the tail end of the dinner rush. Turns out I was mistakenly overcharged - I didn't notice. But the girl at the register found me at our table, asked if I'd like a refund or the extra piece I paid for, and threw in a cookie for the confusion! Honesty and great service! The only thing on the menu I haven't tried yet are their take-and-bake pizzas. If they are anything like the stuff you get in the restaurant, I may be in trouble... ",0,0,0,1,0

 Wow! Keep in mind that this is two stars AFTER the fact that we got in for free, without waiting, sat in a super nice booth enclosed in glass, elevated above the dance floor with free top shelf drinks. Also keep in mind that this review is written for who I think is the average Yelper. By that I am assuming that you do not visit Las Vegas on a normal basis, and are looking for the best spots to make the most of your trip (like me). The Good: - Go go dancers that smile, are great dancers, and in great shape. They even climb up the pole with plastic umbrellas. - Great DJ, good music -Being the newest club in town means...it's new. Everything is new and shiny. I like shiny things. The Bad: -Bathrooms lines were stupid long. -Super small club. -Even in the VIP lounge there wasn't much room to dance. Looking around there were people dancing on ledges everywhere. You could not move in the dance floor. -The VIP hostesses are beautiful. But beauty doesn't give you the right to glare at me when I politely decline a drink they shove at me. Also, unless you are a man, they won't even make eye contact with you. The Ugly: -The bouncers are super rude unless you know somebody. Even then, some still have a snooty attitude. The Disgusting: -Not the fault of the club, but a great reflection of their clientele. I'm behind my girlfriend (who is white) and walking towards the VIP lounge from the bathroom and heard this ugly, nasally, voice screech out as loud as she could ""What the F*ck is up with all these stupid Asians?!"" My friend is passing her as she screams this and I am now face to face with her. She stares at me and looks terrified. If I wasn't invited into the VIP booth as a guest, I truly would have made a scene, but I just laughed at her. The Verdict: I would not pay to come in here. In fact, if somebody else paid, I still would not come back. I thought America was past racism, but I was wrong. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My girlfriend and I decided to try this place after seeing it featured in a food magazine. I don't know why the magazine chose this establishment because it isn't that awesome. Fact: it sucked. The service was horrible because we hardly had any. It took about 20 minutes to order and another 30 minutes for the food to come out. My girlfriend's order was wrong, and mine took an additional 10 minutes after hers and my sister's came out. If only the food were good. Their brats were flavorless, and their buns fell apart too easy. The only delicious thing was the Thai ketchup. Everything else was mediocre to average at best. You could probably make it better yourself. I wanted to like it because the atmosphere/environment is interesting/hip (in an urban hipster way) and it has the same owner as La Bocca, which I love. It's just... I wasn't drunk enough to think any of it was worth it. ",1,0,0,0,0

 NoFo on Liz is a yuppie artsy restaurant located right on Elizabeth Ave. The food here is southern with a newer more elegant twist, and with more of a focus on the presentation. . I really like their brunch, especially the coastal Benedict which includes two crab cakes under two poached eggs, covered in a deliciously creamy hollandaise sauce, yeah baby, poached eggs and crab cakes, this is one of my favorite dishes here. I also really like Bill Neal's Shrimp and Grits, ummm, cheese grits filled with lightly fried shrimp, bacon and scallions, this is the shit...its not the best Shrimp and Grits I've ever had, but they are still damn good. NoFo on Liz is a cool place to take a date, the ambiance is very cool and the decor is enough to get the conversation going. not super pricey but not cheap, they serve Brunch, Lunch, and Dinner, but so far the Brunch is my pick. Oh yeah they also have a little shop connected to the restaurant with all sorts of girly artsy stuff, not really my forte, but the girls will probably like it.

 Ah, where do I start. My wife and I used to come here every week until we moved further away for lunch and dinner. The food and service used to be great. When we went back recently though, the service was horrible. It wasnt even busy, but the staff had changed and we werent even greeted by the door and had to stand and look for awhile. When we were finally seated, the plates that came out were extremly dirty with food marks still on them. Even one of the utensils had stuff on it. My wife asked a waitress which was really unfriendly about the plates and spoon. The thai waitress just laughed, grabbed all of it and left without saying a word or apology. We were like ""WHAT THE @@@@! "" Some of the appetizers had changed and the food had obviously gone downhill. We left very disappointed and since then found another Thai restaurant that is closer to our house and the service and food is much better. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I need to start by saying that the beds are just fine and if you know what you're doing (or are an experienced bed tanner), I'm sure this place is just fine (thus the 3 stars instead of 2). However... Judging from the reviews on Google and my experience, it seems that some of the staff is not as well informed as others. This was my first time in a bed and it wasn't until I got home and started reading up on bed tanning tips that I realized how poor my guidance was from the girl working at that time. I wasn't shown anything about the bed, even though I told her a few times this was my first time tanning and I was clueless (which is partly true, it's just been a REALLY long time). Plus, I'm fair skinned and she put me in for 13 minutes starting out (I read later I should have started at 6 minutes to 10 minutes MAX). So, I got a bit of a burn. :( However, this staff IS NICE (just uninformative). She was patient with me and did answer any questions I had, but I guess I just didn't ask enough questions. Maybe I should have researched beforehand, but I was under the impression that the staff was supposed to be helpful - especially if the person is new. It is convenient for me, so I will likely return now with my own knowledge gathered via google search. If it seems to improve, I will update my review accordingly. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I do not recommend this airline. It was my first time flying air canada and I was not impressed. I had a flight from San Diego to Toronto, a two hour lay over in Toronto, and then Toronto to Geneva. The staff wasn't exactly friendly, and I was pointed in the wrong direction more than once. My flight to Toronto was not direct, we all got off at Montreal without explanation where we all stood confused in the tunnel for about 5 minutes because the staff on the otherside of the door hadn't let us into the airport gate. When we got into the gate many people had the same question, where do we go if we just got off the plane and want to go to Geneva? The staff seemed irritated with us but they hadn't told us what was happening or what to do but sit and wait. After about an hour we reboarded. The choice for dinner was chicken or pasta. I took the pasta and after mixing it a bit I suspected that it had meat. I asked one of the flight attendance if the pasta sauce indeed contained meat and she said ""I don't know they don't tell us the ingredience of the meals"" The person sitting next to me was also vegetarian and had already began chowing down after I asked another flight attended who answered ""yes there's beef"". This should have been told from the beginning when asking which meal we wanted. Finally arriving in Geneva, the airline had lost my luggage and sent me twice to the special baggage area where my baggage was not found. After coming back to the office for the second time, they took another customer who had arrived after I did and attended to her before me. At this point I was pretty pissed and after an hour they had told me my luggage was left at Toronto. Not the greatest welcome for my first trip to Europe. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Andre's review was probably pretty accurate last summer - but a LOT has changed at the Orange Tree since then. The restaurant is closed. Bar is closed. Pool bar is rarely open. Front desk - nice people but kind of clueless. I was there for a conference/meeting for 80 people. They seemed entirely overwhelmed by our large group. Rooms were given extremely late, promises that were made when the meeting was planned were absolutely not kept. The main thing is that there is NOWHERE on site to get a decent meal or a glass of wine. Not my idea of a resort. Our room looked like something out of 1982, even though we were promised all remodeled rooms. The weirdest thing was that the shampoo in the room smelled like bacon. No lie. My roommate and I both were horrified, so we had to pick up shampoo (and wine) at a local CVS. Ordering Domino's for dinner isn't my idea of room service or a resort, either. I will say that the golf did look good, and if the restaurants were open and amenities/service were better, this would be a great place for a wedding. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Had a food/bev comp from MGM for totally effing up our reservation. Had to go through this bar to get to our room, so we stopped for a drink. 1 Miller Lite + 1 White Russian = $22, it's only 2 drinks, so I tipped $3. The bartendar accidentally typed it in as a $300 tip which I didn't discover until checking our bill in the tv to make sure the hotel really was comping what they said they were. So I went back down, and the bartender was aware of his mistake, and waiting for a manager to correct it. What I'd originally ordered was a mojito, but he didn't have all the ingredients at the time. When I went back about the tip mistake, he offered one, but at that point, all I wanted to do was sleep. And I wasn't going to sit at a ""fancy"" bar in my pajamas while my fiance waited upstairs. The bartender was nice, though. He's why the place gets the 2nd star. ",0,1,0,0,0

 So we came to st Christopher's for a hen weekend. We were a group of 8 on two rooms of 4. We were on the 4th floor (no lift working- be prepared) and as we were a late booking we didn't have the luxury of choice. Our room was small and basic, 2 sets if bunk beds, 1 Mirror and 2 plug sockets. We unlike our other four friends had no on-suite, we had unisex shared toilets and showers (they get busy in the mornings). Breakfast is included and is available till 10am. It is a continental type breakfast and you can stock up on the basics, tea/coffee toast and cereal but you can order from the menu at a reduced price for staying at the hostel. They have a dinner and lunch menu but be prepared for a little wait during busy times. There is a bar that opens till 1am and every-night there is different entertainment, quizzes, live music, DJs etc... It is very centrally located and you can walk nearly anywhere. There are 2 clubs, one across the road and the other down the road. While staying at st Christopher's I recommend doing a ghost tour, visit the Edinburgh dungeons and take a ride in a rickshaw. Bus tours are a quick way to see the city and on purchase you get a free sundae at the hard rock cafe. ",0,0,1,0,0

It's a bit frantic and lacking in a major order but charming in its bric-a-brac feel. There's no common theme, although it is slightly earthy and, for-want-of-a-better-word, hippyesque in its hand-made children's clothes, gemstone silver jewelery, incense and gifts-of-the-earth vibe. You could spend an hour browsing, looking in every nook and cranny for wee surprise gifts for yourself or someone else. It's pretty in a messy way, it seems that the owner has chosen all that she sells based on whether she likes it. But it works. As I mentioned, there's children's clothes and toys, lots of silver jewellery with gemstones, as well as some hand-made jewellery, but then also some retro, hipster plastic chunky jewllery, incense (including that famed blue-and-white Nagchampa box. A sign to me that a store knows what it's doing when it comes to incense), cards and other things. At the top of Leith Walk on Elm Row, in between Italian delis, print shops, cartridge stores, fruit&veg stores and not many other shops sits The Cat's Miao - an adorable gift and trinket store. It's in an odd location, I can't say I ever would have thought ""I need to get some gemstone earrings for my auntie, I should start having a look round Leith Walk"", but in a way it suits the store as it's so ecclectic and quirky and...not what you'd expect. I really like it. I adore the name. I heart the slightly odd spelling of 'miaow' and the tongue-in-cheek adaptation of that saying ""the cat's whiskers"" (meaning top dog, meaning the best of the best). It's out of the way but I would go out of my way to come here again. I ended up purchasing two small amber rings...for myself. Everyone needs a gift to themselves sometimes right? As a note, I have really small hands and a lot of the rings fit! So for any other people who are petite-of-hand out there, it's worth checking out for ring-trying-on alone. Speaking of which, I need to go back when I have more time to browse the others soon. ",0,0,0,1,0

 It was my first time here so we tried happy hour. We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh. Our entree (teppanyaki steak and scallops) came out even before our appetizers. Steak had no flavor and scallops were small and way undercooked. The fried rice was dry as well. We complained to a manager who did nothing but laugh at my complaint. He stopped laughing only long enough to say he'd take the food off the bill and just walked away without any apology. Finally our appetizer arrived. The steak chicken and shrimp satay was mediocre. Our waitress Emma was extremely sweet and understanding but the manager wearing a pastel striped shirt (MIKE) was a bigger tool than you could find at home depot. To top it off, the cook walked by, stared and made no acknowledgement of us or his terrible food. I will definitely never return to sapporo nor will I recommend it to friends. We opted for benihana just down the street which more than exceeded my expectations. So if you want good food, stay far away from Sapporo. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I went into this restaurant wanting to like it. I received a coupon and had seen it being built on Camelback in my neighborhood for awhile now. Whats not to like about a butter burger right? Its a modern fast food joint with flat screens, free wifi, and even a garage door in front that was pulled up to create an indoor/outdoor atmosphere. Our food was delivered to our table and we enjoyed our burgers. Although, I have to say, I knocked down my rating a star as I read new testament bible verses painted on all the walls. I have had better burgers and fries at other places, but not had to attend Sunday school at the same time. The ambience rating took a big hit thus bringing down the overall score! Anyone know why they chose bible verses to adorn their walls? ",0,1,0,0,0

 Luck would have it that this place is right behind the bank I go to after office meetings on Thursday nights. I never gave it a chance because looking at it from the bank all I saw was a big red sign that said SUSHI. That and it's location on the east side was a red flag to me. Finally, about a month ago I finished my meetings and I was so hungry I didn't care about previous red flags. When I got close enough I saw that this was THE Yama Sushi I've heard about from so many people. Definitely made me happier walking in to try it out. It was packed but I was solo so I didn't wait long for a seat at the bar. Compared to other AYCE spots I found the menu very intriguing from the start because of the sexually themed rolls. I base my review of AYCE sushi places based on the quality of the sushi since I don't get a lot of rolls. My favorite place (I won't name it) still has better quality sushi but the quality here is very good and the portions are massive! The sushi they laid across the rice was probably 3 times the size of my favorite place. To wrap up my night there I had to order the Manwhore roll. The presentation was amazing and the roll was great too! To top it off the service was great! Even though I was at the bar every single server asked me if I needed anything. Sometimes I can't even get a refill of water sitting at the bar at other places. Don't let the east side location deter you. Definitely check this place out if you haven't. I'll be working this place into my Thursday sushi rotation for sure! ",0,0,0,0,1

 As we parked the car, my bf said, ""I hope there's room."" I was like well it's Saturday lunch time...it should be pretty busy if this is a four stars yelp place. But I didn't see too many cars parked outside so I wasn't really sure. The restaurant kinda looked like a house..I've noticed quite a hand full of Thai restaurants that resembles either a house or a temple...and this one really looks like a house. Scottsdale is somewhat a quiet city I suppose since I am very use to the crowds on the streets of LA on a hot summer Saturday afternoon...but here I guess it's too hot to be venturing on the street. ANYWAYS...before I go off topic again...... So we opened the slightly heavy wooden door and to my ""surprise"" there was absolutely not a single soul in sight. It was so quiet I could hear the crickets chirping...Even the waiter looked kinda surprised when we walked in...he might have been thinking ""omg we have customers!."" So to be fair I can't judge the service...it wasn't like they were at all busy...for like hour that we sat there only one guy came in to eat...and I believe he might have been a regular since he was chatting with the waiter. The food is so-so. I had the Drunken Noodles with Beef...SoOo I said I wanted mild spicy...NOT NON-SPICY. But it turned out to be NON-SPICY and kinda overwhelmingly salty. It was hot out of the wok but did not have a hint of spiciness to it. I'm pretty sure mild in the level of spiciness means it's still has a little spiciness to it and not totally not spicy....but whenever I order something that's suppose to be spicy and I say mild...they bring me something that's totally not spicy. =/ I find that frustrating because I can't take medium spicy in Thai restaurants...it's like eating fire for the medium I don't want to know how it feels like to eat hot. Sooo I want mild! Well anyways my bf ordered the Chicken Basil with rice. Chunks of white meat chicken...not to my liking...don't really like white meat chicken but the flavor was also lacking. not really impressed with this place and therefore not sure if i wanna come back the next time...the prices were pretty high too...the waiter told me there's no lunch special so the regular price of my Drunken Noodle dish was like 12 bucks. -_- ",0,0,1,0,0

 Consistently good and reliably authentic when it comes to Pho. I'm beginning to think this place uses measuring cups and tools to ace their cooking (and stay ahead of competitors) instead of human discretion. I usually order the biggest pho soup here. The patriach owner remembers me by now and sounds the alarm that a discriminating eater is here. There are lots of pho places to choose from but very few I believe gets the entire spectrum of pho preparation, cooking, and traditional taste done right. This place I believe rivals some of the best I've eaten in Westminster.. Yep. The pho broth is the best in town, flavorful, licorice , and boiled at the proper durations; many hours and hours. They put in beef shank(cross section of the cow's leg) that tends to melt away in my mouth; this takes at least 3 hours to boil. The tripes, tendons, and flank are all there, soft and fresh, as well as the meatball. The garnishment (clean bean sprouts, basil, green peppers) is minimal but sufficient. I can only say I always either had their super pho and ""com tom"" here because that is all I eat. I would drive the extra miles just to come here. No place beats making pho like at home, at least outside you have this place that does a very competent and delighful job and they take care of the long prep, cooking time, and dishwashing involved. Very appreciated. Those itself makes it a super value. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Stayed here during Wuste'14 for four nights. My friend and I booked a room at the courtyard two months ago prior to the event. First impressions of the courtyard. Looks pretty ghetto and it smelled and the halls are way too long and was pretty hard to find our room. And on top of that. The courtyard has no elevator so if you have a lot of stuff and luggage Gluck taking it upstairs. The second night we noticed our room was pinned down according to the front desk since housekeeping came in during the day and discovered a bug infestation in our bathroom due the the pipes I guess. That was really gross and good thing those things didn't bite me or my friend or else I would have filed a lawsuit against them for not meeting the needs of customers. I complained to the front desk about the bug infestation and also the air condition sucks in the courtyard room! The first night my friend and I were hella hot and did not even us our blankets. The front desk kindly gave us a room in the tower at no extra charge which was good. Courtyard reminds me of motels at a ghetto place. If you want to enjoy get a room in the tower. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I don't know why, but XS continues to rub me the wrong way. I've been here twice, both on Sunday nights during the summer so maybe it's because I'm not feeling the outside-only deal where 25% of the people got the memo that they can wear their bathing suits at night. The outside is gorgeous but it doesn't make me feel like I'm at a club at all. The ""dance floor"" or whatever right in front of the stage is too small and if you go towards the back where there's A LOT of space, you can't really hear the music or feel comfortable enough to dance because people are just lounging around. I'd give this place one more chance simply because people really seem to love it and maybe I've just been going on the wrong nights or I wasn't drunk or enough or I need to wear better shoes. Maybe on a Saturday. Maybe during the winter when they actually open up the inside. 2 stars because the only good thing that came out of my last time at XS was that I discovered Max Vangeli. Even though I was in a pissed off mood and my feet were killing me, his music was awesome and made my night a little bit better. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I come here way too often for you to be fucking up my coffee the way they do. EASY ICE, it's not that complicated. I finally said something to the girl at the window, after having to scoop out ice, on more than one occasion. She looked at me, dumbfounded, and continued to stare at me without any apology, ""we'll try not to fuck it up next time"" nothing. Maybe she should work a little harder on her customer service and less on her tacky red lipstick .

 Purchased $1700 worth of rubber floor rolls for a fitness facility. According to their website, floor rolls would lay downon their own within 24-48 hours. Over 1 month after laying the rolls down, the ends still have a strong upward curl. The site advises carpet tape or glue as optional. Carpet tape would not adhere to the rubber. Floor rolls were not cut evenly. Seams would not line up. They would at the ends of each roll, but gap in the middle. Seams length wise pushed against each other at one point causing bubbles but then gapped later down the seam. Floor was laid down using chalk line and was told by a professional flooring contractor that the rolls were all cut at different widths and weren't straight. Tried to remedy with the since October 1st and the following occurred: -Alicia Vitte (employee) offered $35 refund after looking at photos I sent in. She said she can see how they are still curled and not lining up. I stated $35 refund is an insult. They sent out 2 tubes of black seam sealer stating that would fill the gaps and make it look fine. Instead the seam sealer being glossy highlighted the seams, got under the floor rolls, expanded, and caused more bubbles. Clients started tripping over the bubbled floor. In addition, the refund for only $35 never appeared in my account. -after not receiving the refund, I called asking about it, now very frusterated, and I was transferred to supervisor Kanar. They asked for more photos in which In sent. Photos still showing curled up edges, uneven seams, but even worse looking now after the seam sealer application. I also unglued the floor at this point and trimmed the area with a t-square to remove the glossy seam area and in hopes of creating a straight seam. Floor still curled up making lining up seams impossible. - Kanar advised she could see the issue and it was approved to send 3 new 50' rolls. I asked for a confirmation email. Never received. Instead a voicemail saying they wanted more pictures yet again. Now manager Sean got involved saying issue would be resolved that day. Instead, received another email asking for more pictures and accused of poor installation. Note that the website clearly States these rolls need only to be rolled out and allowed to settle. Carpet tape or glue is optional according to the site. The main issue is the rolls still curl up over month later, and the seams literally do not line up. I have read other complaints regarding rolls being off by 1/4 inch. Rolls were measured and are indeed different from roll to roll. I now have a floor that is hacked up with curled edges. The company is poor about returning phone calls or emails. Furthermore, I have statements from clients about tripping on the curls and also documentation that new rolls would be sent. However they have now backpeddled and are not sending them out. If the website reflected that installation would REQUIRE glue, that the curls may not ever lay down, and that rolls were not exact cut, I would never have bought these. I am a small business and the floor was the biggest investment I made. I feel company is poorly organized and makes false statements about their produxts. Further, the site states a swiffer wetjet will clean them. I bought one and the rubber is so tacky it will not move on it. Currently I invested another $100 on carpet floor mats to lay of the edges to prevent tripping. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I really like the concept behind Sweet Tomatoes: salad buffet! It's a fun way to get your greens when you're out and about. In addition to salad, you can supplement your veggies with soup, pastas, and desserts (think homey cobblers, brownie bites, and muffins). Sweet Tomatoes is definitely ""cafeteria casual"" and its clientele is compromised of young families, vegetarians, and seniors (my observation on several visits). While I appreciate the freshness of the produce and prepared foods -- turnover seems to be very quick -- I think that the price is a little high for what you get (about $12 for one adult dinner without drink), especially since there are hardly any protein options (beans in the salad area, cheese in some of the pastas, and chicken in the chicken noodle soup consist of all the protein offerings). However, for my pickier friends who just can't decide on anything and who want to eat healthier, I'll typically suggest Sweet Tomatoes. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've been going to North ever since it opened. Actually my whole family has been going there for a long time and the four of us are pretty damn hard to please. Dinner here is consistently good. WARNING: Parking is a bitch at dinner time but worth the hassle. Favorite dish: Pasta Bolognese - oversized shell pasta with seriously, the best meat sauce i've had in Phoenix, all toped with melted cheese. The atmosphere is chic and modern with glass windows that look out on Kierland Commons. Can be noisy at times given the space is somewhat small and the bar and kitchen is open to the restaurant. All in all...North is one of my favorite places to eat for many years. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Nice-looking building from the outside, w/ beautiful views of one of the man-made lakes nearby. I really enjoyed the walks I took in the park that this branch is located in. Using the library though, is another story. In the times I've visited, this location was either closed or full of noisy children and pre-teens who ran in and out of its doors unattended and people of all ages who talked loudly on their cellphones. The computer section was always crowded, and I could never find a seat to use or an empty table void of backpacks and other items left there by their absentee owners. I'd say that, for the most part, this library looked and sounded more like a coffee shop (there's a section where you can purchase coffee and some pastries) than a quiet library where one may hope to do some productive work. There was a good-sized selection of CDs, DVDs, and books-on-DVDs, which I used a couple of times, that allowed you to place holds on-site and online, and this service was fairly prompt at notifying me of the availability for pick-up, but I quit using the services when my hands, and anything that the items touched, started to smell of body odor from the previous users that handled them! (I think that many of the handlers carried the items under their armpits as they walked back to the library, which I'm sure we've all done before w/ books and other items, but think about it-- we do live in the middle of the desert, and bodies do get hot and sweaty...) No matter how many times I wiped the items down w/ sanitizing cloths and washed my hands w/ soap AND sanitized them, the odor wouldn't disappear! Utterly disgusting, and I'm not exaggerating! Don't believe me? Pick up a DVD or book on your next visit and take a whiff... Don't say I didn't warn you!! Come for the relaxing/energizing walks and views around the lakes. There's even a playground or two on the other end of the park for children to play in, and many picnic areas w/ grills and tables to use. You can even go fishing! [Just don't expect to eat what you catch, though-- the lakes are contaminated w/ toxins and algae (there are signs), and I've seen more than a few floaters and dead small animals bobbing in the water.] If you plan to walk all of the paths, make sure you have a friend or two accompanying you, esp. around sunset, bec. there's a specific location that only has one entry and exit, which could become dangerous-- if someone's stalking or following you w/ malicious intent, well, you're S.O.L. I hope your experiences at this library turn out better than mine! ",1,0,0,0,0

Breakfast croissants - disgusting! I asked if they were baked fresh and was told they were. Ordered 1 ham and cheese and 2 ham, egg and cheeses.

 I hate to do this because I always try to support small businesses when they are just starting up. But I simply cannot recommend this place. I came in with a friend fairly excited expecting a California burrito with fries and the like, but that wasn't even on the menu. Instead we got bland and not particularly authentic Mexican food. PROS: The beans were the only part of the items I tasted that actually tasted very good to me. The meat all seemed to be very high quality. The shredded chicken was good but a little under-seasoned.The inside was nice enough and the staff was kind. CONS: YELLOW AND WHITE SHREDDED CHEESE MIX that tasted like it was from Walgreens. I'm sorry but for me quality mexican food uses chihuahua cheese, queso fresco, or if they absolutely have to, high quality Monterey jack. The supermarket cheese blend was liberally thrown allover everything in a misguided attempt to plate the food. On the nachos the cheese wasn't even melted. For the flauta, the fillings inside were cold, which was awkward because the tortilla was fried and piping hot. The quesadilla was were the cheese really disappointed me, when I paid nearly $4 for a cheese only quesadilla I expect some good quality melty mexican cheese and lots of it. Instead we received something that would cost a dollar to make in a dorm-room or any place that has a microwave. OK: The guacamole is ok. It's without question very fresh, but I don't think its house-made. The chips were standard. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Have to write a quick update because this week I visited FEZ twice with my in-laws since they are in town. After picking them up from the airport, I took them to FEZ for brunch - this was my first time trying the brunch and I can say for certain that I will be back. Loved my breakfast panini and it was just the right amount of food. My in-laws loved the frittata and eggs benedict. After being wowed by brunch, my in-laws insisted on going back for dinner. The $5 martinis on Tuesday night were awesome - my mother in law is determined to figure out the apricot martini so she can make them at home! As always the FEZ burger, the rosemary chicken sandwich, and sweet potato fries were delish. According to my inlaws the lamb kisra was great and heated up well the next day for lunch.

 Bon aller je vais essayer d' \ u00e9crire un avis en anglais, un petit effort aller ! I arrived in LV earlier than scheduled. So after trying around ten hotels (all sold out!) i found the Days Inn. It was not so bad because it has a quite good location. Let's start with the place. When i arrived at the reception something was fun. They propose to the guest to buy the pillows ! At first you laugh, and then, once you've tried it you start thinking of buying a pillow in the US during a road trip. They are PERFECT. Maybe the best pillow i never tried so far. Anyway the room was clean. It has a desk with a chair, a dressing and a bed with a fluffy mattress. The bathroom is normal. What i liked in this hotel, it's the swimming pool and the jacuzzi ! Actually the jacuzzi was very hot (almost as hot as the outside temperature) but the swimming pool was perfect to freshen up. I went there by night so it was calm and quite, which is very nice. You have lot's of fast-food around the hotel and you can walk to strip. It's 5 minutes by feet. Just be careful because they say that the breakfast is including in the price of the room. It's true but you have to pay the drink if you order other thing than a glass of water... ",0,0,1,0,0

 The Turf is an Irish Pub in downtown Phoenix. On Thursdays they have live music, and it seems that everyone in the bar is musically inclined. The band was really good, fun, and helped the dark atmosphere by lighting it up. Now, service wise.. it was kind of tough to grab out waitress. We went up to the bar several times instead of waiting for her. Maybe we were in her blind spot? Or she has a lot of other work going on we are unaware of.. making it hard to keep track of tables.

 We came here on Labor Day at 12am and waited for 2 hours. The waitress said it would take 3 hours but we still didn't mind. There were about 10 parties ahead of us. Also, I didn't know this place was actually a BAR. It's surrounded by the slot machines and there are no tables. So everyone is sitting at the bar facing the cook and waitress. Oyster (half dozen) - $12. So fresh! They shuck the oysters to order and I saw them throw away oysters that aren't Oyster Bar approved. So it's nice to see that they care about the quality of their food. We were debating on getting the dozen since it was only $6 more. I regret not getting the dozen. Combo Pan Roast - $23. My husband and I shared and it was a perfect portion for us. The cook gave us 2 bowls of rice and didn't charge a split plate fee, which we thought they would. I think they just gave us less rice each. The shrimp was so great. It was not overcooked and just the way I liked it...a bit undercooked. The crab was shredded in the sauce which I don't prefer but it was still good and the lobster were in chunks. Service - Our waitress was so kind and fast! I forgot her name but she kept moving and serving everyone. I also saw the cook go around the bar to clean the table. I thought that was cool since you don't ever see that! Definitely a team oriented restaurant. The cook also joked around with us that they ran out of oysters. I'm from southern california and this reminded me of The Boiler in Chino Hills. Oyster Bar is a great find but it didn't amaze me as much as I had hoped. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Not impressed. It's sad to see that a business owner sank a bunch of cash into a place, building a fabulous patio and large screen TVs all over the place... but the food was terrible. Hummus gross, veggies dry, burger bun ruined the burger... our waitress even failed to ask how the food was, but she was very nice. The other comments on Cougar Den are hilarious.... now that I think about it, my friend and I were totally the only people there under 30 besides the staff. All in all - the food was the #1 reason I'll never be back. Shame, nice place and good location, too. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Beautiful scenery and landscape. Staff was very friendly. Hotel room was ok. Double sink was nice. Carpet was surprisingly dirty. It left your feet black. Bathroom door was rotting away at the bottom. The food at R Bar was ok. The restaurant prices were high (standard for a resort). However the quality of the food was below average. Therefore the quality to price ratio was very low. I was not alone in thinking this because I saw another hotel guest send back his $18 salad because as he put it, ""this is not an $18 salad."" Lastly, I can understand resort fees, however, when no mention of the fee is made at check-in and it just appears on your bill with no explanation, the fee is annoying. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Very disappointed. My girlfriend and I went in to the bar area on a sunday they where not very busy and we sat down to place a to go order.

 I love outdoor markets- I think this one rivals the one in San Francisco's Ferry Building farmers market. As with all farmers markets, it's dominated by locally grown goods, though you have to read the signs/labels carefully, as there *are* some imported goods as well. Fresh veggies, fruits, herbs, flowers...etc.- all are wonderful amongst the bustling and colorful farmers stands. I tried the creperie stand in the middle of the market- pretty good- and picked up some baked goods from one of the boulangeries/patisseries, as well as smoked salmon from the fish shop. YUM.

 If you've become bored with In-N-Out like I have, Five Guys might just be your saving grace in the upscale pseudo-fast food burger world. The line was sizable, but moved quickly. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially since I was unfamiliar with the menu. Even with the crowd, I barely had time to fill up my drink before my order was ready and on the counter, and everything was cooked perfectly and as ordered. The thing that really stood out about this burger was the bacon. Holy hell, that might be some of the best, most crispy bacon I've even had the pleasure of eating . Trust me, I eat A LOT of bacon, you might even call me a bacon connoisseur, so you can take my word for it when I say this place has incredible bacon. Frankly, Five Guys is better than In-N-Out. There, I said it. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This Taco Bell takes so long, it's not the best place to go for munchies because you'll be sober by the time you get your food. 1:00 AM, only car in the drive through on a Wednesday night/ Thursday morning. 5 minutes to get our food. We didn't check it there (our bad) but we got home to find out we were given the wrong item despite having the order repeated back correctly. I'm not sure how this happened as there literally no one else in the drive thru and dining room closed. They do have a happy hour from 2pm-5pm with $1 loaded grillers and drinks, so I would be willing to deal with the wait for that deal, as long as my food was correct. The drive thru is a really tight turn in if you're coming from the right, it's almost easier to circle through the parking lot so you're turning left into the drive thru. ",0,0,1,0,0

 What a quaint little bistro this is! We made reservations to dine with some friends for dinner. There was a nice ambiance in the dining area with a guitarist and singer that played light music during our visit. The restaurant was very welcoming and cozy. We started off with the Dungeness Crab Cake. They were good! Not over the top but still good. This was served with mixed greens, At the same time a bread basket was brought out for the table. It was just ok. It was kind of mushed and dry. For my entree I chose the Pan seared white fish in which the waiter was raving about. I can see why... Delicious and tasty! The garlic white wine sauce smothered the fish. The pesto mashed potatoes that accompanied were ok. I wish there was more of a pesto flavor. The service here is impeccable. Our waiter was very attentive. The other staff which helped with refills were very polite and accommodating. Our entire group enjoyed the food and service. I would recommend trying them out!

 We kind of got jacked around from the start - there were four of us, and we reserved a room with two queen beds. When we got to our room, our suitcases were waiting for us in a room that had one king-sized bed and one couch. Calling down to the front desk immediately, the conversation went kind of like this - Us: we were not given the room we reserved. We would like you to remedy the situation. Them: we gave you a complimentary upgrade. [Translation: Either there are not any rooms with two queen beds available or we are too lazy to find any]. You're welcome for upgrading your room. Us: I'm sorry, this is not going to work. Let me talk to someone who understands words. After being passed to three people, we found someone who understood the situation and we finally were given the correct room. But without a fridge - I couldn't believe it! And one remote for two TVs. Hmm. I never actually slept in the bed all weekend, but it looked comfortable. The two showers were nice, and there was a massive sink area, another plus. The hotel itself was larger than some small towns. It was immense. By the end of the weekend though, I could easily maneuver it. Bonus - the casino didn't smell over-perfumey or smell like smoke, which was nice since I walked through it frequently (but didn't gamble). There were lots of bathrooms everywhere, another plus since you're drinking lots (of water) since it's so dry in Vegas. ",0,0,1,0,0

 If you don't want to read my crazy long review, then just take one thing away: Go with friends, lots of them! There are soooo many delicious-looking yummy dishes and desserts to try, and unless you are a black hole, there is no way you can sample them all yourself! By splitting everything, we were barely able to sample every dish at the buffet before calling it quits~ :) The buffet atmosphere is awesome! The food area is clean and well kept, the floors and vacant tables are spotless, and the design is brightly lit. Bacchanal definitely stole my group of girls' hearts with the dessert area. Be sure to take a walk around the entire buffet before jumping in line, because the buffet winds around all the way to the back starting with seafood, homestyle American and BBQ, fruits and juices (they have horchata, albeit it being overly sweet), Mexican, (an extremely small area of) Indian and Italian, pizza, charcuterie (think meat plate), cheeses, salads, Thai, sushi, dimsum, and Chinese food. The dessert area is it's own entity in the middle of the establishment with petite cakes, cookies, pies, crumbles, macarons, whoopie pies, fruit, and gelato! My sweet dreams come true :') seems like they continuously make their desserts fresh, so visit this area often because new ones occasionally pop up. I actually really dislike buffets because I have no self control =.=' buuuut Bacchanal's lunch buffet was $48, and it was totally worth it for the experience with my friends! Just looking at the food was fun by itself, and there were a lot of choices that were new to me, like ceviche. It was great, since I could just sample a little ceviche instead of ordering it at a restaurant and risk not liking it. The buffet comes with bottomless mimosas, and afterwards be sure to enjoy some organic peppermint tea (which helped us soothe our overworked tummies!). There was some filming going on for what I'm guessing was a Food Network show, so Bacchanal *must* be da bomb, right? I highly recommend the miso sea bass from the seafood area! It's super tender, wonderfully flavored, and is served with bok choy and something that I think was wasabi mashed potatoes. Really interesting flavor mix and oh-so-dang-delicious ^^! And if you think you see a tea dispenser near the seafood and pizza stations, that's not a tea dispenser. It's melted butter. One of my friends learned the hard way, haha! Apparently patrons can stay up to 2 hours, but I'm pretty sure as long as you are still eating and not just camping out to wait for dinner, your group doesn't have to worry about stopping mid-bite. Just FYI, lunch and dinner have the same menu. Our waitress was *the* nicest lady ever and super smiley, yayyy ^^ Don't forget to tip generously-- the wait staff works hard clearing dishes from your feast and making you feel like a king!

 This is a child's paradise and a parent's affordable way to kill time on the weekend or during the weekday! The park is owned by the city of Scottsdale ad therefore they keep it very clean and well-kept. There are several acres of grass which offer the perfect spot to put down a blanket for a picnic and game of catch. If you'd rather sit at table, the park offers plenty of picnic tables that make the perfect location for a birthday party BBQ. But that's typical of every park. What sets this park apart from the rest are the additional perks! First up, the train. My nephews love this park because they have a train ride that goes around the park. It's pretty cheesy for an adult but it's heaven for a four year old! After the train ride, check out the train depot with model trains on display! Once you're done, take a carousal ride for a couple dollars and end your afternoon with an ice cream cone from the ice cream shop and browse the toy section while you wait! This park is an affordable option for an activity with your little one that won't break your bank. However, I only advice those traveling with children in town to actually visit the train park. It might be a little juvenile if you're sans kid. Event note: check out the Christimas tree lighting ceremony, holiday activities and music in the park during spring time! ",0,0,0,1,0

 So beware. Super crazy getting in here for lunch or dinner during the holidays. Maybe other times too but we tried for lunch and wait was 5 hours. But if you come early (say before 10 am) you can get in at a reasonable time. Brunch buffet was a nice spread that included sparkling wine. Omelettes, lots of shellfish, chicken dishes, potato, mini pancakes and waffles, sushi, and much much more. Of course there are deserts and sweet rolls. Main thing lacking was decent bread. Found croissants and some other ones but no rolls anywhere. Good overall was pretty good and fresh. Waitresses did a great job keeping the glasses and cups full and tables clear. Worth a try but not worth a long wait in my opinion. ",0,0,0,1,0

 When I fist moved to Vegas, I'd always here from people to try Blueberry Hill because it's suppose to be delicious. There's one near my house and it is always packed so I sort of believed the hype...but it was more like ""eh""...The service was very lacking. Besides being very friendly with my 7 month old baby, we rarely saw her and she didn't even refill my mom's coffee yet the table next to us had 5 refills. The portions are overly proportioned and very worth the price you pay. I had the strawberry pancakes which was more like a tower of pancakes and strawberries. I didn't even eat half of it. It didn't really taste good, it was bland. I'd return to IHOP for my pancake fix in the future. The kids menu has great options to satisfy any needy or picky kid. Beware of the menu for adults. I though Cheesecake was bad, this place is right behind them with all the options they have. The hot cocoa came with whip cream and a chocolate chip cookie in it. That's a nice touch.

I have had to go three times in the last two weeks and have a few more appointments coming up. I can honestly say I am not dreading the sessions as much as normal. They also have been great to work with for payment, since I am paying out of pocket. The other amazing thing is that they are open a few Saturdays a month. since I work an ungodly amount of hours this has been clutch.

There wasn't a line up getting in and normally I would be thrilled. If only I knew it was a result of this place being pretty crummy. The service stunk. There was never anyone around.

 The BF and I decided to bring his younger brother here to celebrate his 26th birthday. I had eaten here a few years ago and I was hopeful that Picasso would be as good as I remembered. I was thrilled that it was every bit as good as I remembered. Since we were in a festive mood, we ordered the Menu D \ u00e9gustation. They also offered a wine pairing and I must admit that every wine paired perfectly with each dish. This should really not come as a surprise given that Picasso boasts an impressive wine menu. Our meal consisted of: * An amuse bouche of seasonal soup * Maine Lobster Salad with Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette -- the flavors complemented, but did not overpower, the delicate lobster * Pan Seared Sea Scallops with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau -- the scallops were perfectly cooked * Saut \ u00e9ed ""A"" Steak of Foie Gras with Roasted Peaches, Vanilla, Muscat and Crushed Almonds -- the crushed almonds make this dish because they provide a contrasting texture; I actually preferred the taste of this foie gras dish to the one at Restaurant Guy Savoy at Caesars, but that one wins for unique foie gras presentation (see my Yelp of Restaurant Guy Savoy Las Vegas for more detail on that fab meal) * Roast Lamb -- the meat was perfectly prepared. They decided to serve a fairly tall piece of lamb on its end for dramatic effect. The server tilted my BF's plate before he set it down and the lamb nearly slid off the plate. I made a joke about it trying to run away and the staff went with the humor. * We added the cheese plate and they brought a nice selection * The desserts were wonderful and this place employs a talented pastry chef. The server caught my reference during dinner that we had a birthday at the table and they had written Happy Birthday in insanely beautiful script in chocolate on the birthday boy's plate with his opera cake. The BF had the apple beggar's purse with calvados and it was lovely. I opted for the molten chocolate cake on our server's recommendation (even though I am SO over molten chocolate cake) and I must admit it was delightful. The center was like a molten truffle. It came with boysenberry ice cream and some poor soul in the kitchen was so kind as to separate out individual segments of fresh boysenberries to adorn my plate. * The post dinner truffles and other tiny bites were very good, but no match for the treat cart at Restaurant Guy Savoy. The atmosphere of this place is utterly beautiful. Be sure to walk around the room and take in all the original Picasso masterpieces. The fresh flowers are gorgeous, especially the display on the large table in the main dining room. It's also a hoot to watch the Bellagio fountains spewing outside the restaurant's windows every 15 minutes. Before you leave, step outside on the lakeside patio and catch the fountain show from this vantage point. You really get a sense of how high that water flies into the air. Picasso remains a Las Vegas fine dining delight. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Maybe I am spoiled with the Mexican cuisine in Salt Lake City, but I just don't think this place lived up to the hype. Over 700 ratings averaging 4.5 stars, I thought it had to be mind blowing.. but not exactly. We had the spicy pork tacos and carne asada tacos. The guac was very bland. The service was really bad, too. We ordered and stood there forever, finally getting our carne asada tacos. They must have completely forgotten about the pork tacos, but after reminding them we eventually got them. It wasn't even crowded, either. It was a bummer to discover the horchata was out of service, too. I wouldn't go back here--but that's because I can get better authentic Mexican in my hometown. I guess I can see how those who don't have access to these type of places would love it. It's definitely authentic.. just not that great. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It was OK, but my family gave me a lot of hard time picking this one for dinner. I went to this restaurant because I read Yelp reviews that said it was overall good. Many of the businesses pay to get rid of bad reviews. This may be one of them. The service is good. The food is OK also, but it is no way near the good quality food I had years ago at a similar restaurants. BBQ pork is great. The spicy fried eggplant was not. We ordered a crab and shark fin soup, a combination cold dish of 3 items, a fried lotus root cake, a crispy spicy beef, and a fried spicy eggplant dish. The three of us could finish neither the crispy spicy beef, nor the fried spicy eggplant because they tasted very similar. The beef was just fried some thin material, not very good.

We had the Caesar salad, spaghetti & meatballs, their garlic rolls and our friends had the warm spinach salad, every single thing was amazing. The server/owner Domenico was adorable and so nice.

 We're currently one third of the way through our lease and I cannot wait to move out of this place. The property looks nice enough and the grounds are well kept, but our experience here has been lackluster at best. The staff is rude, for starters. They don't handle complaints in a gracious or timely fashion. We had an issue with a drawer in the kitchen that kept tipping in. They came out five times before I gave up on that. Yes, it sucks, but that's par for the course here. Last Monday, something caused a flood in the bathroom/hallway/kitchen area after hours. It took the on-call maintenance guy over an hour to arrive, and he couldn't find the source of the flood, which had thankfully stopped at this point. The carpet person arrived another ninety minutes later, ripped up the carpet, sucked up the water and set up a large fan. By Thursday, I was asking the office when they would be replacing said damaged carpet. They told me that they would just be cleaning it and not replacing it. They also said that I told them the source of the flood was the second bathroom's toilet (I did, really? It's good to know I live in Imagination Land.) On Friday, I went into the office again, and they told me they'd be out to clean it that day. Right around closing time, the carpet person's assistant showed up, removed the fan, and did no cleaning or tacking down of the carpet. He said he didn't know he was supposed to do those things and didn't have the materials to do so. Finally, eight days later, they have tacked down and cleaned the carpet, after much nagging by me. I have never had to work so hard to get basic service from an apartment complex. In addition, they do not keep track of packages in the office consistently, and I have had mail go missing on more than one occasion. They also roll water and sewer into your rent price. They recently raised this, so our rent went up, mid-lease. I am disturbed by the fact that they can change what we pay pretty much whenever they like. Pros: - Close to shopping and grocery stores. - Easy to get in and out of. - Relatively quiet. Cons: - Rude, non-responsive - Things don't get fixed properly. - Price may change. EDIT: The complex changed ownership at the end of my lease, so this review may be completely outdated at this point. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Maybe it's nostalgia, but I remember Arby's being better as a kid. Soggy buns, deli meet, and the cheese sauce is runny and lacking in flavor. I think the gas station nacho cheese from a pump is a higher quality. We gave them a chance thanks to some mailer coupons and I wish we paid full price at the sub shop across the street. The only thing saving this review from 1 star is the service.

 What beautiful restaurant! The decor is to die for! But the service and food are ok. Actually the service was extremely long and as far as the food goes, 3 of my friends and I found that it eatable yet some dimensions missing in the mix of ingredients. I personally had a Pad Thai and described it as boring...the sauce that generally enhances the combination of shrimps, noodles and all involved was just flat. It as if they had left two colors in the spectrum of the rainbow. But absolutely worth seeing! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have ordered the strawberry shortcake here many times. So when I needed a custom cake, I knew I had to go to Leopold's. I almost got the strawberry shortcake because it is so light and good, but given that the guest of honor for the baby shower I was throwing was a huge chocoholic, I went with Devil's Food cake with strawberries and vanilla ganache (I think!). The guy at the bakery was very friendly and helpful. He had a lot of great suggestions. I showed him a pic I found of a cake I liked and he suggested buttercream hand design instead of fondant. Woo-hoo! Cause fondant tastes like paste. Given the reviews on here about people's cakes not being ready, I made sure to call and confirm a couple days before my event. Had absolutely no problems! It was definitely pricey but the cake tasted good (although a little dry) and I was very happy with how it looked. My friend was also very happy and I would return to Leopold's for a custom cake again. Although I still think the strawberry shortcake is the way to go! ",0,0,0,1,0

 The hotel overall is great with all the stores they have the lazy river pool, but the rooms definitely need an upgrade. It felt very modern and out of place. I didn't like the room settings at all.

It looks like theres a mirror at the end of the aisle but it just actually keeps going and going until you finally reach your room like 3 miles later. Other than that I like the overall hotel.

 I've been to Prime several times, with different friends, for different occasions. We don't stay at Bellagio, but always made the trip to Prime. Had I been yelping when we first started going there, this would be a 5 star review. 2 times ago, 3 of us went, for my birthday, and noticed the decline in the food. Still,the service, and having desert and coffee on the Terrace afterwards, with a front row view of the fabulous fountain show more than made up for it. The last time (2011) when I called to make reservations, I stated that we would like coffee on the Terrace, after dinner. I was told that you could now have your entire meal on the Terrace! That was great news, except that you could not reserve a table there, but could take your chances. Why?? I was calling 2 weeks ahead. Ultimately, we were seated outdoors, as requested. Our waiter, Luis, I think, was RUDE and he and the mini waiters helping him, were slow and inefficient. Our meals finally came, and my daughter's steak was wrong. She ordered a medium rare, Kobe filet mignon, and was brought a dried out, well done, New York. The waiter was upset, and insisted that was what she had ordered. The New York had never even been considered, and we told this idiot, when we placed our order, that we were anxious to compare the regular filet that I ordered, to the Kobe filet. He said the kitchen would be ""mad"" if we sent it back. We sent it back anyway. Pretty brave on our parts! It took 1/2 hour to bring what she had actually ordered. In the meantime, my meal, and our sides, were getting cold, so we ate from my plate. Our bill was over $400, for 2 people. I didn't want to raise hell, and spoil what was left of my daughter's birthday dinner, but did email the manger when I got home. I gave her a detailed description of our experience. As the manager, she should have appreciated the polite, constructive and honest feedback. Her email back said that she was sorry, and was looking into the matter. She said she did not want to lose us as future guests to Prime, and would I please send my phone number so she could call and discuss the matter further. I sent my phone number, and never heard from her, again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Went to pre-drink here before we headed to the Wynn. It was a Saturday night and were were able to grab a few seats at center table. The place is dark, the DJ was pretty good, and our cocktail server was really nice and super fast. One of the guys we were sitting by gave us a B1G1 card/coupon so that was a nice little deal. I ordered one of their specialty cocktails: Raspberry Lemon Sherbet WITH a Vanilla Foam. It was super sweet but super YUM! There's some tables if you want to play too.

 DO NOT come to this business! The owner is very smug snarky bastard and a thief! If you need work done on a scooter that is not one of the kinds they sell, don't bother here. My husband and I went here to get our 50cc scooter fixed. It had been a problem to start, putting and dying a lot. We took it in to get a full inspection and tune up to fix anything that was wrong. We wanted it in full working condition. When we came to pick it up we found the owner had arranged for things to be done that we did not want. He charged us for his time but did no engine work like we needed. When we asked about purchasing a particular part he said it was $5. Then later he said it was $45. When we told him he quoted us $5 he refused to admit that there was even a possibility that he said that and was incredibly rude to us. He swore that our scooter was ready to go but that day it broke because he changed out our performance parts for stock when there was nothing wrong with them so he could steal them. When we took the scooter back a couple days later the owner refused to fix it . He passed us over to his other mechanic. They then broke our seat, broke the floor battery cover, and gave us our scooter in pieces! BEWARE! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Artie may be great at what he does as over reviewers dictate but lacks a certain professionalism unfortunately. I found Artie on Yelp with great reviews, spoke with him over the phone and described the extend of damage and the approved leak as per water company in units per hour. (The water company has taken almost a year to determine the specific leak. It's two quarts an hour from my copper water main.) After inviting him to the property he only quoted over the phone with no visuals. I specifically noted this detailed quote needed to be submitted to the insurance company. I received a loosely hand written quote that was labeled ""pipe and cost"". As to size of pipe and length, or allowing for multiple leaks, we will never know. After contacting Artie again detailing the insurance company would never pay on this over simplified proposal and I needed more detail I never heard from him again. I requested a second quote to replace the shutoff value to the house from the water main line and that just never happened. So we never got to the ""service"" part of the process. Good luck getting there! ",1,0,0,0,0

 We had breakfast here recently and the Governor of North Carolina was eating there, which makes perfect sense: this place is just a good 'ol fashioned Charlotte-style breakfast joint. Nothing fancy, but great nonetheless. Since it's not much to look at, I was kinda surprised when I walked in on a Sunday to find Eddie's TOTALLY packed. Make note of that if you're coming here on a weekend. As for the food itself, it was pretty good. Mostly offering standard breakfast options, Eddie's also has some more southern style foods like grits and biscuits n' gravy, both of which were ordered by my group and were deemed awesome.

 Muslims have Mecca. Surfers have the North Shore. Hillbillys have NASCAR tracks. Everyone has their own personal Holy Land. Mine is Hash House A Go Go. I started writing yelp reviews because I love breakfast. Now that I have been to Hash House A Go Go I might weep like Alexander the Great because there are no more worthy breakfast places to conquer. We arrived to a packed house on a thursday mid morning to a packed house. It is always busy. We sat at the bar and introduced ourselves to Randy the bartender, who was cool as hell. While he was super busy, he didn't give a hurry up vibe. My buddy Bear, (who has eaten Sayler's 72oz steak and fixings, making him my personal hero) stated he was hungry and order the fried chix eggs benedict and an additional waffle. Randy asked him if he was sure because that was going to be a lot of food. Bear said 'I'm hungry"". Randy said ""If you finish it all I will buy the waffle"" Line in the sand drawn, challenge accepted. The fried chick benny is awesome. Fried cheese. Biscuits. Mashed taters. Eggs. Something green. Heaven. I couldn't finish mine. One of the guys, Steve, had the most delecious smelling and looking plates of french toast I have ever witnessed complete with fried bananas on top. Indeed it was the Best French Toast Ever because we went back the next morning and I had it. Back to the Challenge. Bear gave it it a mighty attempt, eventually mixing all the waffle and benedict together and shoveling it in. In the end the waffle got the better of him. Randy said it is the farthest he has seen someone get. He asked Bear who should take the ticket for the Waffle. Like a trooper Bear said ""Right here. I couldn't do it"" I think Randy appreciated Bear's stand and bought the waffle anyway. It was awesome. If you go to Las Vegas, get off the strip and try this place. I am looking for a vacation condo near it, so I can live near the Holy Land. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This an update since Buffalo has moved downtown. Overall I am a fan of this place. I love the eclectic mix of clothing I find here. I always see something interesting and out of the norm, which is a plus. If I wanted to shop for boring run of the mill stuff, Id go to Ross or Macy's. I do see a lot of ""young"" brands, which is fine, but I do see obscure designers too. Its a hit and miss like any vintage/thrift store. There are two views of this place. Shopping vs selling. If you are selling be prepared. Have eclectic stuff, designer or high quality trendy stuff. At the very least make it presentable. Clean and pressed clothes will do wonders. I find most of the buyers here are pretty cool. They have a tough job, no doubt. When it comes to buying, its a grab bag. I see some great stuff at way below retail, and I see stuff at full retail. The pricing is a little all over the place. If you know brands and retail pricing, you will know a good deal when you see it. Overall a fun place to shop and well worth a trip. The new location is nice, but dark. Standing in front of the mirrors, I was totally in the shadow as the over head light were behind me. Other than that, thumbs up. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The food is okay but the waitress sucked! Someone fire her! I bought two groupons, one for my friend and I. When we got there I realized you can only use one per table so my friend and I were forced to sit at separate tables. ( which is understandable) There was a table right next to the one I was sitting at but the waitress refused to seat her there. Instead, she walked my friend to a table on the opposite side. For some reason she had a problem with us sitting near each other. Oh and did I mention she had an attitude the whole time? Anyway, due the the lack of hospitality, I will never go there again!

The broth is so rich and the ingredients taste fresh 3) They have homemade cookies! 4) The Korean Chicken and the pork are both great choices for dinner.

 I took my car for an interior clean, which includes cleaning seats and carpets. Mermaid gets 2 stars because my car was a whole lot cleaner when I left than when I brought it in, because the cashier was competent, because it took less than the two hours they estimated, and because the parrots entertained me while I waited. Other than that, not much was good. Where to start.... - I had to make an appointment for a detail, which I didn't know because it isn't mentioned anywhere online or on their signs. I was told when I pulled up, so I turned around and left, and called for an appointment. - Approximately zero communication. The check-in guy just told me to ""take this to the cashier."" The vacuum guys opened my doors and stood there staring at me, completely silent. Good thing the building it set up to show you where to go because I sure didn't get any instructions. - When I got my car back, the first thing I noticed was that there were mud splatters low on the door. They had driven my car through puddles on the way from the detail bay and hadn't cleaned it up. - The second thing I noticed was that my seats were wet. Not dripping, but way too wet to sit on. They gave me plastic bags to sit on, but as an afterthought, and not before blaming my seats for holding the wetness. 24 hours later, my seats are still wet. - And then there were all the items in different places. They'd removed things from all of the pockets and compartments for cleaning, but instead of putting them back or even leaving them all in one central place, they left them all in different places. My favorite was the phone book left on the wet seat. - As I drove around that afternoon I started to notice all the other issues: streaks on the back window, puddles in my cup holders, a spill in one of the plastic compartments that I was able to easily clean with a wet cloth (so why couldn't they?), grittiness on the dashboard, a LOT of the outer coating removed from the bag around the stick shift. - And after a couple of hours....the smell. It's a combination of Little Green cleaning solution and mold, which makes me think, 1) they use detergent & water rather than steam, and 2) they didn't even use clean water. I was hoping the cleaning would get rid of the faint trashy smell that had developed over time, but the car actually smells much worse now. Bottom line: Mermaid does a decent job on the big stuff, but half-asses the details, and skips the customer service altogether. Octopus does a much nicer job for similar prices. ",0,1,0,0,0

 4 nights/ 5 days in Vegas, I must say that I am glad that we stayed at the Venetian. We opted for the standard size King suite. In the living area sits a large L shape sofa, a 4 seat dining table & a work area equipped with a fax/copier and plenty of power outlets for your laptop, cell phones & charging needs. The bed was super comfy filled with some comfy pillows. I must agree with another yelper, it's not a standard king or cal king, this king was kinda on the short side. My SO mentioned that his feet was touching the end of the bed. As for my 5'2"" frame, it didn't make a difference to me. The bathroom was perfect for the size of the suite. The throne was enclosed with it's own door, separate glass shower/ tub, his and her sink & a vanity area for the Mrs. I loved the fact that the tub had a nice slant to it, it was super relaxing during my bubble bath. The his/hers sink was major plus considering that there was not a mini fridge in the room, we utilize sink #2 as an ice cooler and stocked it with alcohol. :) Minus 1 star for not having a mini fridge to keep our cold drinks & issues with our key scanner/reader & the long hallway to our room.. It took us several tries to unlock our room. One night we actually were locked out, but the facilities tech response time was very reasonable. Overall, our stayed at the Venetian was great. From the first day at the front desk, to the bellhop, to housekeeping to the facilities tech. The room can easily accomodate 4-6 ppl if you are travelling a group. We would definitely stay here again, It was sweet to retreat to a suite rather than a box. :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've only heard good things about Holyrood 9A and I've been desperate to go, but Mr LG and I just never had the time, or money. So one Saturday evening we arrived at Holyrood 9A famished and thirsty. We waited around twenty minutes on a table, which for dinner time on a Saturday evening was not bad. The service was grand. Not too overbearing, not too shoddy. Just right. I had an original burger, because I'm a plain kind of girl. The food took a wee while to come but when it did it was worth it because IT WAS THE BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD. Well, so far anyway.

 I was a huge fan of The Guilty Lily that came before The Bonnington, although will admit to not having been very often since its kitchen closed in August (I loved the burgers, and its sister pub The Espy is a bit far away in Portobello to go for one when I'm feeling too lazy to cook...). Therefore the Bonnington was always going to have a lot to live up to. The decor's very different to GL, with a much more classic, traditional but trendy feel complete with fake bookshelf wallpaper. Prices are average, and at the moment it certainly seems to be doing well with plenty of custom at weekends. We went for a quick drink on Saturday, which coincided with both our downstairs neighbour starting his stag do off at the pub (this meant the bar area was fairly monopolised) and the weekly open mic night - last weekend featuring a rather pleasant country/bluesgrass singer. Have yet to eat, but the menu is fairly standard pub grub - steak pie, Hunters chicken etc. I do wish they did chips are a side though and not only with meals. Hard to give it more than 3 stars when I've not eaten, but it's perfectly pleasant and a decent local. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Came for dinner. I really wanted to get crab legs on my trip to Vegas. The legs were really tiny, but I still enjoyed them. Dessert was disappointing. I liked the coconut gelato, but it seemed really frozen and not creamy. Nothing was labeled in the dessert section, so I accidentally grabbed carrot cake. It was dry. So was the cream cheese frosting. The strawberry tart tasted really artificial, like it was made of strawberry instant pudding. I liked the fried scallops and shrimp. I couldn't find soy sauce for my sushi. It's been a few days since I ate here, but I remember liking it. Everything is all kind of a blur because we did the Buffet of Buffets--ugh, never again.

 Went in for a quick after-lunch coffee. I thought I'd been to Cartel (a different location) before but I couldn't find my review... anyway, it was decent, but I'm not seeing the hype. I got a macchiato - espresso with steamed milk - and it came in a TINY little tea cup. When I ordered, the cashier said they only make it ""traditional"" and I had no idea why he said that to me like I didn't know what I was ordering... I'm sure they get a lot of people in that expect the cr \ u00e8me-laden chocolate monstrosity that Starbucks will give you if you ordered a mocha macchiato there. However, I hated that he presumed I had no clue what I wanted. With it, I got a chocolate chip cookie - which was larger than your average cookie and undercooked to perfection - but not really worth the price tag. The cookie was $3 (yikes) and the espresso $3. Mom's mocha was another $3. Now, I appreciate that they roast their own coffees here so you get a wholly unique flavour but my espresso was really bitter. Like, medicine bitter. I like a super strong roast flavour but I want it to also be smooth and flavourful. This was neither. Mom agreed about her mocha. 3 stars for effort, environment (the window paintings were awesome and plenty of comfortable seating) and a great cookie but I wouldn't come back. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Let me preface this by saying that I am a huge fan of Denny's. I eat at Denny's about once a week (can't beat that greasy diner food)! This location is the closest to my house and it used to be my favorite it town. You could say I was one of the regulars. Well, that has all changed! Apparently the place is ""under new management"" and the new manager just plain sucks! I am a low-carb eater and one of the reasons I love Denny's is that they will accommodate me (by letting me sub broccoli for hashbrowns / toast / french fries). I have done this for years at Denny's locations all over the country (including this one) with no hassle whatsoever. Well, guess what? The ""new manager"" no longer allows this -- NOT EVEN WHEN I OFFERED TO PAY AN UPCHARGE TO HAVE A FRESH VEGETABLE INSTEAD OF POTATOES! What? Second, my regular waitress informed me that the ""new manager"" will not allow them to bring out water in a big glass and will only allow them to bring out a teeny, tiny, miniscule glass of water -- ONE AT A TIME -- to customers who only order ice water to drink. See my photo of how tiny this glass is, it is absolutely ridiculous! Add that to the already understaffed and overworked servers and you are really making their lives miserable. I drink like a fish, especially when I want water. I felt so bad that our waitress had to keep running back to refill my midget-sized water glass every 3 minutes. Since this happened, I've been back to Denny's at least 10 times but not this one. I'm not going to set food in this location ever again. I just don't get why some managers are SO shortsighted. You have alienated a long-time customer and believe me, I have told ALL of my friends about this. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This continues to be our favorite place for late night food that provides the island flavor satisfaction we seek that other downtown area places don't have or when we don't feel like waiting in long lines for oxtail soup.

I'm really not a beer person but I guess people here come for the best of that too' Love the atmosphere and service is fast considering the variety of dishes the kitchen needs to prepare. Food for the mood...you can be sure that if you're feeling light there's great salads and appetizers, fresh oysters, edamame, artichoke dips, sliders, and every traditional favs. Or if you're feeling hearty try king size prime rib, meatloaf, Alfredo with garlic bread, many more!!!

 Recently I received word that my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant Alladin's Kitchen closed its doors. This was, at least for me, the best place to get your Mediterranean fix including some of the tastiest stuffed grape leaves around. I can go on and on about how much I loved Alladin's but alas, I have to pick myself up and rise above this terrible loss. When a door closes a window opens and that window lead me right into the kitchen of Haji Baba. Situated along Apache Blvd in Tempe this spot is half restaurant and half Middle Eastern market and bakery, talk about a one stop shop. Upon entering, please feel free to seat yourself. On my visit there were menus already at each empty table. Scanning the menu the first thing I noticed was the Abali Yogurt Soda ($1.69). Having never tried this I was quick to get a glass full though the waiter seemed hesitant to bring it. Let's just say after the first sip yogurt soda is an acquired taste. While I liked the yogurt sourness the saltiness of the soda was way too much. Fortunately the waiter was observant and brought over a glass of iced water by his own accord. I have to tell you that the service here is attentive and friendly. The occasional juvenile in me snickered when I read the first item on the menu, Homos Tahini ($2.29), how appropriate. Joking aside, this was a beautiful puree of chickpeas, tahini or sesame seed paste, lemon juice and garlic. Usually this is served super garlicky elsewhere I was delighted to find this version to be well balanced and flavorful. Getting the same treatment as the homos, the Babaghanooj ($2.99) contains roasted eggplant instead of chickpeas. Both were dressed with olive oil and adorned with pickles and olives, were wishing for a glass of wine to compliment the appetizers, but they serve no liquor here. Made from a mixture of fava beans and chickpeas, then pressed into patties and deep fried, the filling of the Falafil Sandwich ($2.69) was crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside. The warm pita bread and the fresh lettuce and tomato made for really good eats, a must. Kabob Koubideh ($7.49) sounds like quite a mouthful and let me tell you this, it was. Pounded ground meat marinated in onion juice, and then grilled to a juicy smoky excellence. The meat reminded me of a Middle Eastern take on chopped steak, sublimely tender. Along side was a huge pile of super light basmati rice, fresh hot pita and creamy yogurt salad. A sprinkling of sumac over the entire plate adds a slight sourness, which melds incredibly well with this type of food. Desserts are pretty much limited to Baklava ($1.29), but after such an amazing meal it was a real surprise that the sweet ending was a real disappointment. The nuts in each all tasted old with a slightly bitter rancidity to them. Selections ranged from pistachio, cashew and walnut with the later being the best, using the word ""best"" loosely. With meager prices, generous portions and outstanding service, Haji Baba will definitely begin to fill the void in my heart and my tummy. ",0,0,0,1,0

 When I came in to eat here I was under the notion that it was 50 cent wing tuesday, seeing signs outside even telling me that as well as inside. But when I sat down they told me they had raised the price on it, so it was now more. It was annoying but it didn't stop me from eating. I had the hot wings (As you should at a place known for wings). I am too use to hit things so these little babies had little to no effect. The wings were very small so there wasn't a lot of meat to each wing. It was extremely hard to flag down my waiter to get a refill, plus he was very rude to me. All in all though the wings tasted good and thats all that really matters in the end. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Wow! This is a fantastic restaurant with REAL ingredients made fresh! I never thought I'd find something this good in a growing neighborhood. The service is fantastic to top it off. I couldn't believe they actually make their own cheese for their pizzas and calzones...fantastico! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I know Bachi is short for Hibachi and all, but does no one know that bachi means idiot in Cantonese? Seriously? My girl busted out laughing as we past this place after eating at the Japanese restaurant next door, figure we'd give it a try next time. We ordered the ronin burger, the steamed buns with pork belly, sweet potato fries, truffle parmesan fries, matcha green tea, and the toffee cake for dessert. The ronin burger was delicious with the egg yolk over the med-rare kalbi, but the steamed buns were a bit pricey for two small pieces even though it was good. Both fries were pretty good eats. I'll stick with my matcha green tea smoothie from Jamba next time, the tea was too grassy for my taste. And unfortunately the toffee cake tasted like something pre-packaged, just ok. We'll definitely come back to try some of the other burgers. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Too expensive. $5 dollar beers, $15 access to VIP section, then $20 for a 2 minute lap dance. With her only sitting on me 3 times. Over 4 years ago i went to a strip club near the airport (can't remember the name of the club) and i got a close contact lap dance for 40 minutes for a total of $80 with tip.

 we found the staff friendly and general hotel amenities, like breakfast, ok. However, We did find: the bed was too soft the AC was annoying as there was no way to keep the fan on with the ac as well, resulting in uncomfortable temperature fluctuations in the room all night Garbage trucks collected garbage at 2:20 am Sunday morning - waking us both. We were put into a room with a shared door resulting in loss of sleep as our neighbors were inconsiderate and had no sense of how loud they were. If would have been nice if we were warned of this at checkin and given the option to choose another, more consistently quiet room. Maid did not refresh washcloths on the last day For these reasons we will select a different hotel upon our return to Phoenix. ",0,1,0,0,0

 First time here and LAST time. There are too many other nice places In town to go to, do not waste your time and money here. Went there on a Wednesday morning and it was not busy and waited to be seated. I also noticed that that was the norm for all customers. Ordered and shared a few things that were recommended by the waiter - breakfast burrito and Hawaiian Breakfast which were both average to poor. If that is what is recommended then the other dishes must be pig slop. The over the top was when my daughter ordered orange juice and then had a refill and that came to $5 and $2.50 so I asked the waiter why there was a price difference an was explained that each juice hasa $2 surcharge and that the first glass of oj was $5 and he thought he would give me a break and charge a refill for $2.50. Wow sounds like somebody feels guilty of the price. The waiter said he would include a comment card which would go straight to the owner, so I thought Yelp would be a better way to wake up this cafe. Lastly, I thought all the items were way over priced from entree to beverages. I love trying new places but the key is to have your customers come back which I will not be back here until things change with prices and service. If I could give this place a zero star, that is more reflective ",1,0,0,0,0

 Raising Canes is usually what I call fail safe food. It's really hard to mess up chicken fingers with a big cup of lemonade or sweet tea. And their ""Box"" combo with Texas toast, cole slaw, fries and 4 strips is priced right too. But all that being said this Cane's location found a way to serve some of the soggiest, saddest fries you can find in Vegas. While the chicken fingers were hot and the Cane's sauce was cold as it should be, the soggy fries left everyone disappointed today. 3 Stars.Sorry but the fries just didn't get it done. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Horrible! My family and I went here months ago and we were in the drive thru for about 20 minutes. They couldn't get my order right! They kept asking what my order was. Do I really have to tell you what my order was 6 times?! The staff was slow, unprofessional, and rude. Then we finally got our order and drove off.... turns out they still managed to screw it up. We got different flavors than we asked for. We were never given a receipt. I contacted Bahama Bucks online and she said the owner would be in contact with me shortly... months go by and I didn't hear from anyone so I messaged her again asking what the hold up was. This went on for about another month... Then I finally got an e-mail from the ""owner"" and I couldn't even make out half the email. His English is severely broken and he makes no sense. Then he said he would send me coupons and I was okay with that... Another month goes by and I didn't receive anything. Then I e-mailed him and he argued with me!! He said I need to come in to get them. I am 9 months pregnant and do not have the time or energy to drive 20 miles to get a coupon. Then he was asking if he could come over to my house! What?!?!?! SO UNPROFESSIONAL. I said no of course and then he said he would mail the coupon and I suggested he use a tracking number. I never heard back from him and here we are 2 weeks later still with no coupon or solution. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had! I will never return to any Bahama Bucks nor will my friends or family. This place is horrible and the owner is a jerk. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This was my first Cirque show ever so maybe that's why I was so confused. Honestly, the entire time during the show I kept thinking, WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON??? My friends and I got some amazing seats. We sat in section 106, about 6 rows from the stage (the performers were right next to us when they entered). Found a great deal online and only paid $99 for those. I was surprised that they didn't play as many mainstream Beatles songs as I thought they would, many of them I have never even heard of. Most of the show was a lot of interpretive dance, people running all over the place, stuff thrown everywhere. It took me a few songs in to figure out there is no storyline, just a live music video. I think I would've enjoyed it more if I knew what was happening the entire time, it was too many things happening all at once. There's a weird part where they pull a sheet over the entire audience so you'll get knocked by this giant white sheet. It's sort of cool when they suck the whole sheet under the stage afterward. I want one of those helmets they wore while on the rollarblades! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I just stop at Einstein's for the coffee, so I can't comment on the bagels. I don't mind waiting in line to pay, as long as a motivated cashier is working through it. What grinds my gears about this Einsteins is that when there's not a line the cashier disappears into the back room, leaving four or five other people standing around and watching me wait several minutes to pay for an effing cup of coffee. No one says a damn thing. No one says, ""hey the cashier will be back in a minute"", or ""hey cashier! There's a jerk here who just wants coffee, can you come take his money?"" Perhaps adding insult to injury, they have a sign that says ""coffee express line"", what the hell does that mean if no one's there to take your money. But the good news for me is that there's an Einstein's in North Scottsdale by my office, so I go there now. They get it, the cashier never leaves the area, so it's always a quick turnaround.

 A few of my girlfriends and I went to an afternoon tea at the Mandarin after a fun weekend in Vegas. The Tea Lounge is located on the 23rd floor and we were seated next to the floor length windows with a view of the City Center. The decor in the lounge was a lacking and felt outdated. There are only a small amount of tables for tea service...probably about 8 or so. The area is open and is shared with the reception desks. Our seating area was two couches and a table which was a bit higher than a coffee table. The seating was not the most comfortable arrangement and the table was small for the amount of pots, plates and cups. For $36 a person (not including tax and gratuity), we had three tiers of delightful scones, tea sandwiches and desserts. The scones were my favorite because they were light, buttery and served with homemade jams and the best Devonshire cream. The desserts were small bite sized chocolates, cakes/tarts, macarons which were beautiful. The finger sandwiches were ok but the presentation was very pretty. I ordered the Monkey Picked Oolong tea because it sounded interesting. Supposedly monkeys were trained to pick the choicest leaves from wild tea trees, which were enjoyed exclusively by the Imperial Court. The service was great. All the staff are very informative on the different types of teas and can suggest one to your liking. All in all, an afternoon tea with the girls is always a fun way to end your trip in Vegas!

 I've been to Verde about 4 times before, and most recently I dined here for lunch with a group of coworkers around the holidays. The restaurant kindly accommodated our party of 12 at a large table in the back corner of the restaurant. Service was prompt and the food was wonderful but the restaurant wasn't all that busy while we were there. A few of us ordered starters like guacamole (it's fresh and delicious) and the salsa trio (also fresh and wonderful tasting), and I ordered a large guac to share with my end of the table but when the server brought it out she had split it into 3 bowls and spread it over the table and it really wasn't my intention to pay for guac for the whole table particularly after they ordered more on the other end and didn't get it split up for the whole table - just bad execution on our servers part. Otherwise the food and service were great. Most of us got either the Burrito Mojado or the Burrito Especial and a couple of folks got a few of the different tacos. We also got the red sangria and it was absolutely one of the best sangrias most of us have had in a long time. Overall it was a great meal and on par with the other meals that I've eaten at Verde. I will definitely be going there again. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We came to Firefly to celebrate my fiance's birthday while on a one-night trip to Vegas. It was my first time at this type of restaurant. We started off with the sparking sangria, and proceeded to order half of the menu to share among 4 people. The food was great, but service was a bit slow. The server didn't offer any recommendations, which seemed odd since the menu is long, and it's a popular place. Unfortunately, 50% of our party came down with salmonella poisoning a day later. My fiance was very ill for 10 days and lost over 14 pounds. I was lucky, and didn't get sick. We aren't sure why, but I didn't have any of the seafood dishes, so perhaps it was something there. The food was great, so it's disappointing that their standard of cleanliness with their food preparation is so low. ",0,0,1,0,0

Began with the fried veggies which were both cold & unchewable. Then so happy to see Chicken Korma until I realize it's thigh not breast. Chili Chicken very good as was the Garlic Naan but the rest was totally ""off"" for me today. Will now search for another #1.

 The college of frozen desserts Some people cannot tell the difference between gelato and ice cream. Their loss. Although ice cream has more butterfat and more sugar than gelato, gelato has more flavor. The fruit or chocolate flavors are not muted by the butterfat. This lesson was well learned on our trip to Sweet Chill. As a former college student that spent years trying to pay off college debt, I know that any education can come with quite a large price tag. I expected a dessert-lunch (yes, I was having gelato for lunch) at Aria to cost as much as my college education. Afterall I was about to learn something. To start, I learned that pistachio ice cream (er... gelato) isn't my cup of tea. Neither is Nutella. Total cost for these lessons, zero. If you are questionable about a flavor, just ask - they'll happily give you a small spoonfull. I also learned that a small is like $4.75 while a large is $7 and change for 3 times more of the Italian confection. Since I was there with my wife, we went with the large 3 scoops (Strawberry, Chocolate, and Blueberry Cheesecake) and saved a few bucks. I also learned that gelato is denser than ice cream. Ice cream is about 50% air, making it easy to scoop (if you've ever melted then re-froze ice cream, you know the stuff is rock hard without the air). Gelato on the other hand is only about 25% air. It's freezing point is kept in check with less fat and a scientifically-balanced amount of sugar to maintain it's softness. This results in 50% more edible dessert. If you eat with your eyes, you may feel that $7.57 (after tax) for 12-16 ounces is pricey, but you stomach will be filled as if you just ate 18-24 ounces of ice cream. A fine lesson indeed. Finally, I learned that Aria (in the City Center) must truly be an expensive place, because even though I was sitting in a kid-friendly location (essecentially an ice cream parlor) I didn't see signs of a single kid. Tables wern't sticky, floors were clean, chairs were spotless. But the decor was all hard plastic, so maybe after a group of kids come through, they just close the doors and hose the whole place down with a high pressure firehose. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Hidden gems of creamy snowy ice!! The ribbons on delicious snow are so much better than regular shave ice from Japan or Hawaii.

 My hubby heard a few people talking about this movie theater for awhile so for his BDAY I took him there to see ""Man of Steel"" this past weekend. The theater is cool but it was getting to and from there through the garage that made the experience a little frustrating. Those signs are not helpful. Well, at least, don't do what we did. We took the elevator through the garage. I hit the starred button for the first floor and the thing shot up to the sixth floor and just sat there. After about a minute, we panicked. We hit a bunch of buttons and still no movement. Finally we had to call security. This went on for a good 10 minutes. Finally, I hit another button and it took us to the basement. Not sure if security came or not cause when we got out, we ran for it. Coming back we were able to see our car from where we parked on the Gila Monster level but getting to it was like going through a maze. It felt like a Twilight Zone episode where the stairs never take you anywhere. It was like an endless climb. Like I said, the theater is way cool but the directions need to be more direct.

 Maybe I'm spoiled by the quality of Japan's fish when I studied aboard there, but Kabuki's sushi quality is ok when compared to Japan or even any other sushi restaurant in America. I ordered Taro and it did NOT taste fresh and it tasted as if it were defrosted by a microwave. YUCK. I was disappointed in the rolls I purchased; they were rolled too loosely and fell apart! :( Too expensive for the quality you get. Happy hour is cool. The cocktails aren't anything special....(tastes as if they're made with the cheapest sake/soju, bottom shelf liquor...) Oh yeah, and their soups...well the broth tastes as if it's been premade by some mix rather than by fresh meats. It's nothing better than top-ramen. Lastly, I must say, their wait staff mainly consists of the typical non-japanese asians for an Americanize Japanese restaurant....I believe there is 1 or 2 people that were of Japanese decent.

 Recently stayed at the Westin Casuarina and was pleasantly surprised. More of a business traveler hotel than a resort. Not glitzy by any means. Room was clean and modern (Except for the TV). My one complaint would be the heating and cooling system. Had to call maintenance after being in my room for a couple hours because it was 61 degrees in my room, heat wasn't working (It was 52 outside). They came in and fixed it but, from that point on all it would do was heat. The next day it was too hot but, wouldn't cool. Frustrating. I left it that way instead of calling maintenance again. All of the meeting rooms seemed to have allot of the same issues. On the upside, The staff there was very pleasant and helpful.

 Milo's was a bit of a letdown. I'd read the reviews on Yelp and was excited to check it out, but the food just did not deliver. I went there on a Saturday night with Arnab M: the place was pretty crowded but emptying as it was getting late, so we got a table right away. The food is American with various influences. I ordered one of the specials that day: duck breast with sauteed vegetables, mashed sweet potatoes and roasted pears (which by the way was almost identical to a dish I had at Escobar's in Champaign, see my review). I thought the duck was a little tough and overcooked, and the sides lacked flavor. Arnab had the Moroccan salmon: again the salmon was okay but the sides were disappointing. For the price (close to $20 per entree), I'm sure I can better dining options in town. Btw, the place is kind of hard to find. It's on NE corner of the Lincoln Square Mall, and it took us a little while to find it. ",0,0,1,0,0

 WELCOME BACK BONEFISH! We missed you but you don't get 5 stars until you bring Grouper back. Tito's Texas Martini may be the best in town and such a deal as well. We really enjoyed the Paco & Lola Albarino but it's $10 less a bottle at King's Fishhouse. We loved the Bang Bang shrimp and Seared Ahi appetizers. However, the dinners were the real stars: Dorado with mango salsa on the side was incredibly fresh with a nice taste of the grill. Ditto for the Redfish special with Romesco sauce, on the side of course. Overall the food quality may be better than my memories of the old store in Henderson. A couple of suggestions: I don't think open bus/service areas will ever be as popular as open kitchens were, so build a wall and add a door. It's ugly and distracting to have that area open to the lovely dining room. About those window shades, they're going the wrongway! Something is needed to block the lower part of the windows, to obscure the view of the parking lot and keep headlights from shining into the dining room. A few minor issues that should be addressed but great food and drinks at reasonable prices. Hope they stick around for a long time. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place is a joke, advertises up to 70% off retail but their self stated retail prices are way above and beyond actual retail prices ex.

How about personalized floor mats with someone else's name on them only $29.99. An empty small tool box stated as a 115pc tool set retailed at $199.99 for $52.99. Most of the retail prices on the electronics are at least 6 months old(electronics depreciate a significant amount in the first few months) I walked around for about 5 minutes and left. Everything is overpriced. Some items are over retail. Better luck going to your regular big box store. If the pricing structure doesn't change it's going to be CLOSED BOX BYE BYE. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Interesting blend of sushi, peruvian and brazilian cuisine. I had heard raving reviews of the place so had high expectations. We ordered a number of small plates, being a pescetarian, our meal was restricted to fish and vegetarian items. The shishito peppers were delicious. The Peruvian corn was authentic. We ordered a couple of pieces of nigiri sushi - they were well cut and the rice was warn to the right degree. We had also ordered a salmon roll, it was so so, you could hardly taste the fish, there was too much tempura wrapped around. I had ordered the caipirinha was it was excellent.

 For once I have basically nothing to say. I came here after work with friends for some beers, laughs, and food. My seafood platter of fried fish and shrimp was over fried and under seasoned but the fries were the best part. Luckily they had great $2 beer specials and a long happy hour. For an after work happy hour I guess I can keep coming back considering it is only a few blocks from my house. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We took our daughters for a birthday party. The kids all had a good time but the adults were treated poorly. The owners were rude and kept complaining how clean they want to keep the place. The owner actually brought a guy back inside because he was outside in his socks and didn't want him to dirty up the place. Did u mention he was rude about it? One more thing I didn't like to see: the lady was vacuuming in the middle of the party. It's a kids party with food. Of course it's going to get messy and dirty. ",0,1,0,0,0

 As a local I've been here a number of times. I love coming here for the convenient location and the laid back nature. Expect to be in a loud noisy dining room with LOTS OF TVS. Food is white washed Mexican but it's decent and I've obviously like it if I've been here a number of times.

 Oh...heck, no...never again! Went there on a Sunday afternoon around 1PM with my daughter. The family in front of us was seated quickly, and then they turned to us and said, ""Would you like to sit in the bar? It's faster in there?"" We quietly sat down, opened the menus and then said ""What the H?????"" We didn't go to Garcia's on a Sunday afternoon to SIT IN THE BAR and have FOOTBALL as our entertainment! We got up, told the hostess she made a very poor decision in asking us to sit there and we left. Did I mention that there were only about 4 tables with patrons at this time? I don't know what that was about but I can tell you it's the last time I'm going to Garcias! ",1,0,0,0,0

 CVS is pretty standard, right? Pharmacy, overpriced beauty section (but you sure avoid going to Ulta if you can find what you're looking for there), great sales--on booze, on food, stationery, games--whatever. When I lived across the street, I used to come here at night when I was bored and it wasn't busy. Now, though, there are new employees and unfair practices. On more than one occasion, the employees have held sale items for themselves behind the counter. Today, there were no Connect Four on the shelf, but there was one in the cart behind the counter. When the manager was asked about it, she shrugged and pointed at another employee. I've worked in retail before, and this goes against most store policies. So, the next time you get a CVS flyer, remember that if it's okay for the employees to shop the sales for themselves here--then it might be happening all over the place. And if they can put one item behind the counter for themselves, then they can put a lot more for their friends. Prepare to be disappointed. Make the extra trip and hit up Wal-Mart. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Hey, it wasn't bad. I'm frugal, so when I saw ""average"" estimated fares for a taxi to and from the strip, I balked. On to the shuttles, then. This company had the lowest fare round-trip that I found (just by pennies, though). Needless to say, I booked it. Our flight was delayed (thunderstorms between So. Cal and Vegas) so we got there an hour and a half after I had made the reservation for pick-up. We went to the kiosk just outside baggage claim and were directed to a shuttle line very quickly. No hassle there. Unfortunately, our shuttle had gotten a flat tire and was in the process of being loaded onto a tow truck as we got to the line. Ok, no problem. We were in no hurry. Whether this was the fault of the company/driver or road conditions out of their control, I don't know, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. We waited about 20 minutes, max, for a replacement bus to come. It wasn't a bad wait at all, and we were able to stay in the shade. Our driver was pretty nice and got us there safely after three other drop offs. On Thursday morning, we called (as advised) to confirm our reservation. Well, for a few different reasons, I looked at the wrong flight time for our outbound flight, mini-panicked while my boyfriend was on the phone confirming our pick-up time, and implored him to change it to an hour earlier. They did this without hesitation. Spoiler alert: the pick-up time I originally reserved WAS the right one (silly me). So fast-forward to the next morning at roughly 10:10 AM (5 minutes before the newly scheduled pick-up time). Our shuttle arrives and the driver quickly counts heads and determines there are too many people and someone will have to go later. He asks our flight times and ours was the latest. He then informs us we will have another shuttle come around to pick us up in about 10 minutes. This was fine by us, after all, we were in no rush and this was due to my mistake. 10 minutes later, a passenger van pulls up just for us. The driver loaded our bags and off we went to the airport, just me, my boyfriend, and the driver (how nice). Our driver this time was not talkative but nice anyways. We ended up getting to the airport three hours before our flight was scheduled to take off, so it all worked out in the end. I would use this company again IF we were traveling in a group (but if it was just us two again, I might use a taxi.) All in all, not bad and we saved money! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Halcyon is a beautiful restaurant, there is a patio that screams, ""cocktails."" Went in today to meet a friend for lunch, I was a little early and hadn't had any coffee yet, very happy to relax (text and email furiously on my phone), you know relax and enjoy a cup of coffee. Service was very nice, no rushing or acting weird because I was taking up a table, he served me a beautiful cup of coffee. Freshly made, strong, served in a large, simple, ceramic cup. It was the best cup of coffee I've had in Charlotte in a restaurant setting that didn't specialize in coffee. Shockingly delicious. Then I wondered how much it was going to be... two bucks. I can afford that! My friend arrived we ordered a few items to nosh on, French onion soup and a grilled scallop and brussel sprout dish. They brought me the wrong item, the server was really nice about, the food runner was prompt in taking care of it and my scallop dish came out really fast. Handled very professionally.

 Overrated! My boyfriend and I went to Vegas for my birthday over Memorial day weekend. Saturday we decided to go to Tao nightclub. We arrived at the Venetian and were ushered into one of two huge lines, (a guest list line and a regular line) like cattle, well, decked out scantily clad anorexic cattle. After slowly moving to the front of the line which wrapped around the building, we were not found to be on the guest list and had to pay the 40$ for guys and 20$ for girls cover! You can get on the guest list ahead of time by visiting the web site well before arriving. Then we are ushered into a maze of dark hallways (still packed in herd formation) but now we are inside and you could start to tell there was little ventilation and experience 'second hand breath'. We stopped at one of the first dance floors and wanted to try to find a place to sit . I asked one of the security/ushers and I got a - HA! Good luck, I guess you can try to sit in the tables until the VIP's who reserved them arrive. I didn't realize this was a privilege to sit. I have only come to Vegas on non weekends before so being a Saturday night on Memorial Day weekend was a completely different experience. So we decide to get a drink. The 'line' to get a drink was like a bee hive pack of people several layers deep which you had to just keep pushing your way to the front as each club goer emerged with their drink. I decided to get something simple since it seemed there was no muddling going on for my picky taste in martinis. I got the feeling if I had asked for a lemon drop I would have had a 'soup Nazi' response of NO MARTINI FOR YOU. The bartenders seemed to want to get you out of there as fast as possible. I ordered a vodka cranberry and my boyfriend his Jack and Coke. I figured my 20$ would cover two single well drinks. Not! It was 32$ for a small bucket type glass. Paid my tab and tried to protect my precious cargo as I made my way out of the bar line/swarm. We walked over to the dance floor and it was just packed and I was getting overwhelmed with the recycled breath and asked where is it less crowded. Thankfully someone told us to make our way up to Tao Beach. As we ascended the stairs, which were like office building type stairwells surrounded by red painted walls with an occasional photo or directional sign on them, we could start to sense the fresh air ahead. After several flights of stairs we finally made it to the rooftop open air Beach. It was a totally different atmosphere! Very open and airy, lots colorful lights and VIP cabanas lined the perimeter. There were very few people up there at that point. It was around 10:00 or so, so we enjoyed having a huge increase in personal space and to move and breathe freely. We found a table / wicker couch/bench type thing with a few pillows that was unoccupied in the middle area of the club. This was a major score as my boyfriend, with great fashion sense and taste, had just got me a super cute pair of 5"" gladiator heels - which I decided to wear / break in that evening. I would have made a different decision on wearing NEW shoes if I knew we needed to get a loan to sit down virtually anywhere we went. Still nursing the overpriced well drink, we looked at the menu on the table for the fee for bottle service, thinking with one shot being 16$ we may be better off with bottle service. The cheapest fifth of Vodka was 600$ for Skyy I think it was. We decided to just have one or two drinks here, soak up the atmosphere and drink for real back in our room or somewhere else. We did enjoy people watching from our comfy albeit temporary spot. There were no cocktail servers that would come by, there seemed to only be there for the VIP cabanas. Several cocktail servers, guys dressed in all black and more girls in fishnets and burlesque type outfits, were parked on the perimeter . The music was good and we actually got to relax and have fun there. After about 45 minutes or so we were asked to move as the group of 6 or 7 young guys arrived who had reserved the table. By now it had become more crowded and twice I was bumped into by a waiter swishing by carelessly trying to rush through the crowd (to the VIP cabana's). I was pretty irritated to lose 5$ worth of my drink in each elbow bump! That is when I decided - I am going to Yelp this! - and that it was time to go. So based on the amount of people they packed in, lack of fresh air, the overpriced drinks, lack of seating and lack of cocktail servers for regular people, that earns -1 stars. The Tao Beach atmosphere was the only positive for me. The fresh air, lots of lights, decent music, and laid back mellow atmosphere earns a couple of stars back. I still would not want to go back nor recommend going unless you are a VIP - so, as a regular person, I ended up with the 1 star rating. ",1,0,0,0,0

 First and foremost, the one huge downside to this place is that almost everything is really reallllly overpriced. That's the only reason I can't give 5 stars. That being said, I always like to stop in here and look around. They've got some really neat stuff, and I find that they sometimes get some new products in before the big box stores. I always bring a lunch to work or school with me so I'm always looking for good, durable, and leak-proof containers and this place has tons of them. They have the absolute best lunchbox soup containers. But mostly I wanted to review this place because there's a young girl who works here who is always super helpful and friendly. And even if I don't buy much here I'm always willing to come back because they have really good customer service. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Beer is big in Charlotte. Heist Brewery might just be the biggest beer thing going (for now). Heist has taken the craft-brewery tasting room concept and blown it out into a full-scale restaurant and bar. The beer is decent (nothing special), but the food is the star here. Lots of unique dishes and healthy options--it's hard to decide what to eat. We came for an early dinner over Labor Day weekend and sat out on the deck (dog-friendly!) where a live band was playing. We were in a slightly hungover state so lots of fried stuff for us and it was all very tasty and in satisfying portions. Overall a great experience at Heist and looking forward to returning.

 Please keep in mind while reading this review that I am a complete wimp when it comes to spicy food. I enjoy felafels and have gone around trying them at various restaurants in Arizona. The felafel meat they serve here, is not that bad compared to several other places. However, I can still tell it came from a box as the waitress confirmed. And it was too spicy for me. One of my favorite foods in the world is Tzatziki sauce because it's so cool and soothing with that delicate taste of cucumber. Today I found out it's the American style Tzatziki sauce I like and not the salty authentic Greek kind because it was, yes you guessed it... too spicy. Maybe it's the same for the hummus because it had such a zing to it, it burnt my tongue. It tasted like spicy chunky ketchup with lots of ascorbic acid added to it. But, hey... this is America. I don't like the Mexican food down in Mexico either. The decor was nice. I liked the dark blue ceiling with white fans and all the Greek looking details they added in throughout the restaurant. The staff was friendly and helpful. The prices are reasonable. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Went in for a shellac manicure. First time in but figured I try it since I got a coupon in the mail and it's right around the corner. I was pleasantly surprised with the fluent English spoken by both women there. The service was pleasant and we all 3 chatted the whole time. Outside of a few inappropriate personal comments made to me by what I'd consider an otherwise well meaning girl in her early 20s, I planned on going back. Unfortunately, once I presented the coupon upon checking out, all of a sudden the 2 perfectly fluent women began commenting to each other in their native language, causing me to wonder what the need for that was. Their open friendly attitudes also changed. I paid, customarily tipped the tech and left. Makes me wonder why they issue a coupon if they're just gonna make you feel bad about using it? I've had Shellac done before and it has lasted a full 2 weeks. This time however, little chips had formed on 2 nails 2 days later, another nail cracked and broke off after 1 week, as well as experiencing lifting at the base after a week. For me, the abrupt change in language indicated they probably weren't saying anything nice about me. Paired with sub par quality of nails, I won't be going back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I tried their Chicken Club with sweet potato fries and it wasn't bad at all, just can't say it was really good. The chicken was grilled, which I prefer rather than fried and the bacon was crispy. I got it on rye bread. Being able to have it made the way you like it is nice, but the sandwich had 3 pieces of bread which I think is unnecessary. Why not just top the chicken with bacon and lettuce rather than squeezing a piece of bread in between? Sweet potato fries was super soggy by the time I got to work so I was a little disappointed, I'm pretty sure it would be amazing if I had it right away. Service was good, my food was made pretty fast and the lovely lady was very friendly and polite. The counter was very clean but it way of been because I was there around 11am on a weekday. It may be more packed and crazy over the weekend or in the afternoons, being that it's a mall. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I'm always craving shabu shabu and having eating at some of the best places in LA and SF, I figured I would give this place a try and see how they stack up. For being in Vegas it's actually pretty good, but compared to other places that I have been it's ok, especially for the price. We came for dinner on a Saturday night and it wasn't crowded at all. Be sure to check in on Yelp so that you can get the check in offer of free hot sake or 2 piece nigiri sushi. I chose the nigiri sushi and got the super white tuna (pretty good) and my friend also checked in and got the hamachi (also pretty good). Not the best sushi, but for a place that doesn't specialize in sushi, it was worth the free offer. I went for the shabu shabu dinner - they have a variety of meats that you can choose from and different grades of beef - for shabu it is on the pricier side - 8 oz for $18.95 of the regular beef (especially when you can get all you can eat in SF for $29.95 - maybe I should recommend this to them). They also have a few selections of broths - I chose my usual favorite of spicy miso. The flavor of the broth was good and the quality of the meat was good too. I think they could give you more of a selection of vegetables (and maybe just plain more vegetables). It comes on a small plate and definitely not a lot of it - cabbage, 2 pieces of broccoli, a few carrots, and 1 mushroom cut up (just regular mushroom, not enoki or any other kind). Overall, a decent place that I would come back to if I was craving shabu, but my search for SF/LA quality shabu continues in Vegas. ",0,0,1,0,0

 During Thanksgiving break, this was one of the places that we took the kids to see. My sisters kids didn't mind the entertainment with the mermaid floating around in the aquarium and seeing the different kinds of fish. My son and my sisters of course had to point out the flaws with the mermaid though. For example, the little ones thought the mermaid was real. My son told them that she was not since she had goggles and a nose plug. Then my sisters just had to point out that the mermaid had stretch marks that were visible. Talk about being a little embarrassed with a full crowd around. LOL. Anyways, we had a great time being together and laughing. The only reason why I gave a 4 star review was because the show was short and not much of an entertainment. The mermaid floated around and waved to everyone. The aquarium was beautiful, though.

 CONGRATS! Nice food HORRIBLE service with attitude by far the worst this year! Food: appetizer : good: tarte tatin fois gras and \ u00e9chalottes main: cold salad, too smoked salmond ( very salted), frozen butter, sent it back salmond, still came cold, Salad was great and the smoked salmon nice but a bit salty for my taste, Ate everything, so this is a good sign. The quality of the bathroom in a restaurant is very important. So I went down to visit. The beige tiles looked very old and did not look too clean either. By the time I came back, the waitresses moved my table. I was sitting on the banquette along the wall. The problem is that it is not a real banquette, there are just cushions put side by side. By moving my table I ended up right in the crack between 2 cushions you can imagine that was very uncomfortable. Service: so I moved my table back to it's original place then started getting the attitude problem from waitress: sort of like: why did I moved the table back to its original place? Service: ordered dessert, then got really pissed off with waitress attitude, Apparently moving table was considered a major offense for her. So I was ready to run from there looking forward to get home and finish my nice expensive wine when I realized that they did not kept the cork of my bottle on the table. I asked her what she did with my cork, and her answer was that is was trowed away in the garbage. She came back and tried to fit an old cork found in the garbage on my nice bottle of wine. Service: it is a BYOW, so why do they throw away the cork or twist offs in the first place? She spoiled my bottle by tring to fit an old dirty cork on my bottle and I had to left it there That was enough for me and I ask for the check 59.95$ and I paid 60$ (exactly .05$ over the price) with no intentions to pay any more. The junior waitresses came back and told me that service was not included. I tried to explain that service was not acceptable then I was ordered to leave immediately otherwise I would be expelled, to my astonishment and the people sitting next to me. I offered them my wine and left. In North America, gratuities is according to the quality of service. Those 2 waitresses there thought I was the problem. 60$ for good meal, 20$ for wine with real bad attitude is not worth the money or time. 80$ with this kind of attitude is not admissible.

 When I think of Italian, I have to admit that I really don't think ""Olive Garden"". But our son wanted to go to a movie to meet some friends, and around the Northlake mall, there isn't a huge selection (there is a large selection, but most are chains) so we decided to try the new location and see how it was. The building is awesome. It's like a Tuscan villa. The food is pretty standard fare. You probably won't be disappointed, and the bill won't be too bad, but it's not going to knock your socks off either. It left us just feeling so-so. The baked cheese appetizer was the bet thing we had, and that left quite a bit of time for realizing just how average the rest of the meal was. Even the desserts weren't that great. Better to have something good than nothing, but they should finish well instead of starting well, so you're not sitting there thinking about how good the first thing was. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Are you waiting for your flight out of the Las Vegas airport looking for some decent food quick? You are in the WRONG place my friend... Yesterday my husband and I were exiled to the far distant D gates at McCarron International Airport where we had FORTY minutes until our Delta flight departed. As often happens while air traveling, our meal timing was way off and we were very hungry. We are accustomed to slog through the modern day date rape that is the TSA screening, then relax, have a drink and some food prior to boarding. I mean come on...everyone knows that airports nowadays have great dining at super fast speeds to accommodate their customer base - you know...people in a HURRY about to get on PLANES?!? Well the joke was ON US when we arrived at our gate. Only fast food outlets awaited us and we HATE fast food so we took a deep breath and made our way to the only actual restaurant in that area which was Chili's Too. We could see 3 empty tables, all of them covered with dirty dishes. One very unhurried hostess asked if we wanted a table. Uh...yeah why else are we here? I have never in my life seen a table cleaned off more slowly. We were then seated and provided with a limited menu but some decent looking selections, everything from salads to burgers. Then it happened... A woman, I assume a waitress, hurriedly passes us by and with a nice smile says the following ""Forty minutes for food."" Then she took off like a shot, leaving NO time to ask her what on earth that meant. My husband and I looked at each other awkwardly and he said ""It can't possibly be 40 minutes for food. This place is in an airport and its not even that busy"" A couple of minutes later our waitress comes by (we flag her down) Here's how it went down: Husband: ""Is there a wait on food orders"" Waitress: ""Yes 40 minutes"" Husband: ""40 minutes from the time of seating or ordering?"" Waitress: ""It will take at least 40 minutes after you order sir"" Husband: shocked speechless look ""uh....ok..."" We then quickly left and went on to have a disastrous experience at Quiznos, but that's another review (sigh) Rant: Ok so what part of AIRPORT restaurant does Chili's NOT UNDERSTAND?? Who are your customers? PEOPLE waiting for FLIGHTS who DON'T have that much TIME!! 40 minute waits are not uncommon it appears from reading other scathing yelper reviews here - seriously what the $&%*??? Avoid this place at all costs! If you are unfortunate enough to have to fly out of the D gates of terminal 1 - BRING A SNACK or plan to GO HUNGRY if you want any decent food! ",1,0,0,0,0

 They have 2 sides one side is the restaurant and the other is a grill style where they cook the food in front of you. Me and my wife have been to both sides and the restaurant side is not so good but the grill side is great. I recommend the grill side because it's fun and the food is delicious. Make sure to tip the cook. We didn't have cash and I felt bad I didn't tip him. ",0,0,1,0,0

 What happened? This is/was one of our FAVORITES in Las Vegas and always bring friends here. We stopped in last night around 8:00 and it was empty and we litterally had to hunt down someone to get us cocktails. Then find someone for a menu. Then find someone to take our order...food was very bland. Soup cold. Pizza so-so. By the end of our meal around 10:00 we were literally the only people there on a Satuirday night. What's the deal? I want to love this place again but wondering if everyone knows something I don't since it was a ghostown. Please please respond and give us a reason to come back!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I had a pretty terrible experience today! First me and my friend walked in and requested to sit outside on the patio since it was a beautiful day, the hostess told us to go ahead and seat ourselves, no problem. We went to go sit at a table and the party in front of us received menus and the hostess completely forgot to give us some and had no intentions on returning with any menus. We sat and waited for a few minutes then a busy server saw us getting impatient and grabbed us menus. We wanted cocktails and an appetizer but it took a while for the server to return. After about 10 minutes waiting to even see the server after receiving the menus we place our entire order. Things were going fine after that, food came out in a timely manner and was pretty tasty. Then I was pretty disgusted with what happened next, the hostess was walking around the patio, grabbed a full glass of water from a dirty table and gave it to my friend thinking she was doing her a favor by refilling her water!!! GROSSS! We decided not to make a big deal but when telling the server about it, he seemed to not even care and made it seem like we were crazy. We then finished our food and left. Probably never going back there again. Terrible service and all the staff seemed like they hated life. Not good! ",0,1,0,0,0

 We visited Mandalay Bay on our honeymoon. My husband wanted to go to this attraction. I was reluctant because I am against exhibits with animals kept in tiny unnatural spaces. I agreed to go because he was doing stuff I was interested in as well. Admission was about $18 a person. The whole thing is a walk through that takes no time to complete. I really did not think it was worth the money at all. He did take some pictures but I think there are better hotel attractions to spend money on. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Heading to Vegas with more than four people for MORE than one night? Get a suite. You don't think it's worth it? You're wrong. But you never stay in the room? You'll want a place to congregate with a big group for pre-partying and assuaging your hangover. It's Vegas, get a suite, get a cabana, get a table at the club and be true to Sin City by sticking to the seven deadlies. Well, maybe you should avoid wrath and suicide, those ones aren't much fun. So glad I convinced you. You're getting a suite, sweet! The Signature is a pretty great choice for this for a few reasons: You'll take Pride in having the best of both worlds. The non-smoking hotel is quieter, more upscale and newer (read cleaner) than the MGM Grand, but you still get to enjoy the staples of Vegas at the MGM by visiting it (casino, Studio 54, restaurants) from time to time through the series of moving sidewalks connecting the two hotels. Same goes for the pool. You have your own pool areas at the Sig, but you can also slum it with the commoners at the MGM Pool (like we did, both are really great experiences). The suites are fantastic. The Trump beats them by a small margin overall, I mean there's a TV in the mirror for Vanity's sake. At The Signature, balconies (you thought there weren't any) can be found in the two bedroom suite option. The views are fabulous, and the rooms spacious, with seating areas and small but full kitchens, perfect for prepping road-sodas for a trip to the casino or club or eating that room service that is perfect for late night Gluttony. Bathrooms are also large and inviting. My only gripe here is that the two bedroom suite isn't truly connected. You enter into your foyer, and then you can enter into the regular room, or the king suite. If you are there with friends (and we had like ten people in these rooms), the doors are constantly slamming. It's on-strip and off-strip at the same time because of it's connectivity to the MGM. Perfect for clubbing at The Hard Rock one night and XS the next, though I don't recommend you walk that far in heels - take a cab! You don't want to look like the rest of those plebes walking around outside of XS, stilettos in hand, feet on the grimy floor, because you walked too far. We spent a completely debaucherous, extravagant, VIP weekend here - and we still remember it as one of the best Vegas trips, ever. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We waited over 15 minutes to get our food! The place was almost empty. When I went to ask why it was taking so long they said it would be right out. The food then came out cold and not very good. The potato wasn't hot, chopped salad had huge pieces of lettuce. I wouldn't go back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The place was very nice. I love the green on the walls along with the decor, very unique. The sushi was delicious. I wish the sushi was colder. What's the point of having room temperature sea food? Inside the restaurant it was also not that cool. When you live in AZ it matters! I was a little disappointed that there was no happy hour so the sushi made up for it. Now for the worst part of my experience. There was only one waitress & her face right from the start you could tell she was angry. She did not greet nor smile at us. She was very quick to give us the menu did not suggest anything or try and make us feel welcomed. I would expect to be treated better when we were the only ones at the restaurant!

 Eat there for the view or if you are on Saguaro Lake boating and are really hungry. Service was not stellar; the waiter seems flustered (Sunday of Memorial Day weekend on a lake during May in Arizona, gonna be packed buddy) and at one point tossed extra menus in a pile and let them fall to the floor and sit there. Decor is very cheap. Orange ceilings and yellow walls with painted cacti and dusty mini silk flowers in pots on the windowsills. Cobwebs in the corners. Definitely would be better to eat outside, not in. Since service and decor sucked, my party did not expect much in terms of food, but the food was good. WAAAAY to overpriced though, but portion sizes are good. The type of view provided and the cheesy decor was almost embarrassing. I understand that people are coming in off their boats, wet, but let's bump it up a bit and offer some more healthy choices on the appetizers instead of just greasy bar food. Train the wait staff to be more polite and attentive; lose the teenager attitudes (they are all teenagers). I will never eat there again unless they lower their prices and/or I am on a boat all day and starving. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Rock Bottom Brewery is a chain of microbrew restaurants, and the Ahwahtukee location is one of the worst ones I've been two (been to three). The best thing about this establishment is the $3 draft/$3 appetizer happy hours, but that is sadly eclipsed by the poor service, ambiance and quality of food. The beer - overall - is fair. There were no clear cut winners. The stout was not so good: I ended up returning it for the nut brown ale, which fared slightly better. The pale ale was better. The service was negligent and awful. She was inattentive, and ended up serving me a beef burger after a conversation with her about getting a veggie burger. Funny thing is, the place wasn't packed last night either. I'm not looking for four-star service, but complete lack of attention stands out for me. Also, the family-style setting (tons of suburban families) really didn't do it for me, so I'll probably only come back if asked to by a friend, not on my own will. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I purchased a whole living room set and in the store the interactions and sales team was all fantastic. The day of delivery the delivery people had called to confirm a time frame and I said ""ok"" and then they never showed up and I had to leave so I called the store and they weren't able to get ahold of the driver. They told me I would have to reschedule and didn't even offer to refund the delivery fee, I had to. I don't even want money back, I want my furniture! But it's the principle. Then, I reschedule it for a day that would not work for me (today) as they wouldn't make an exception to get it to me when worked for me because THEY screwed up. Then today I call to reschedule it and they state it's already on the truck so I have to call back tomorrow. I informed them that after waiting on hold for 10 minutes I would not be calling back and I demanded the store manager to call me. I'm a manager at a hotel where guests complain all the time and I would never inconvenience our guests like this. I asked her to have it delivered on Thursday or Friday and the CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER (or she claims she was) stated she couldn't do that. BS. If you're in a management role in customer service and can't provide service to your customer you should find a new job. I'm beyond angry that I have been inconvenienced by this and would never buy from RC Willey or recommend anyone I know ever again. Not to mention I STILL have no furniture ",1,0,0,0,0

 Everyone speaks so highly of this place and I was so eager to go. But I must say that I left somewhat disappointed. I just went with my husband and they put us on the wall in between other couples. I felt like I could brush legs with the people on either side of me and definitely knew everything that the other couples were talking about. We did go on a Sunday and I understand that he restaurant is located near theaters but I definitely felt rushed. I think that we were in and out of there in about an hour with 2 appetizers, two entrees, drinks and dessert. Personally, if I am going to spend money like we did that night, I would prefer to have a nice leisurely dinner. We ordered the fried Brussels which were good but you also need to expect a somewhat burnt flabor. We had the ahi taquitos which were quite small but not bad. For dinner I had the pork belly tacos. Some were much more fatty than others but still decent and my husband had some sort of steak option. He was extremely happy with his meal while I still think that I have had better. I would recommend this to someone who is going to a play but even then, we had reservations and sat outside in the waiting area for over half an hour to not be comped anything. Even if we didn't get anything comped, you would think that they would have at least acknowledged how long the wait was. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Definitely a cool little hole in the wall place to go. I had the lobster grilled cheese and my fiance had the burger special of the day which was a hamburger patty topped with chorizo and a fried egg. Both sandwiched were delicious. The poutine fries were the usual greasy, not drained enough, typical Montreal fries. But the gravy was different than most I've had. It had mustard seeds in it. Different and better than most poutine gravy I'm used to. Healthy? Heck no. This place is all about comfort food. I suspect this is the place to go after a night of drinking.

 This place was exactly what the majority of the reviews said it to be: the food was great, the dinning experience was not. I really don't expect this restaurant to be around very much longer. Firstly, the main draw to Kalu was head chef Bryan Emperor, however Emperor is no longer affiliated with the restaurant. They are still operating from his menu however, according to our server they are completely revamping the menu which means Emperor's creations are likely out and the new chef, who seemed to spend much of his time behind the sushi bar on his iPhone, will be adding his touches. I do not want to overshadow the fact that the sushi my wife and I had was some of the best that we have EVER had. And that is a bold statement as we are transplants from Los Angeles where bad sushi there, is typically better than the best stuff here, at the risk of sounding pretentious, (pretentious or not, I think being adjacent to the ocean does give you access to fresher fish, its as simple as that). The Kalu Roll was spectacular. The Dragon roll was phenomenal. What I loved was, there was no ""traditional"" sushi, or at least it wasn't on the menu. No unagi nigiri or California Rolls, here. They are all original creations and they were all divine. But who knows how much of that will remain on the menu. I should also note, and this is not an exaggeration, our reservations were for 8pm on a Friday night. When we arrived we were the only ones in the dining room. The. Only. Ones. That does not bode well for the future of the restaurant. The servers were young and inexperienced. They were out of the lamb, they were out of all dumpling dishes, they were out of Kendall Jackson chardonnay. How do you run out of a wine that you can pick up inexpensively at the local Harris Teeter?! And when my favorite Bombay Sapphire martini came with a twist rather than my favorite -- two olives -- I sent it back to learn they were also out of olives. Did I mention that we were the only ones in the dinning room? That means they didn't have a run on these items, it means they opened on a Friday night ill-stocked. So while the food was very, very good, I still cannot recommend this restaurant. I am eternally looking for that go-to Sushi joint in Charlotte but I don't think Kalu will be around much longer even if I felt this could be that for me. If you are looking at Kalu, I am afraid you should keep looking because this isn't going to be what you are looking for. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Disappointed. That sums up my two experiences with this Dunkin' Donuts. This location is right around the corner from my house. We are not donut connoisseurs or food snobs so our expectations are pretty fair and reasonable. We usually buy donuts from Walmart or Albertsons but will make a trip out to Krispy Kreme on occasion. We are big junk food eaters though so when my wife and I first heard a Dunkin' Donuts was going into the shopping plaza we were very excited. The day it opened there was some buzz in our neighborhood and within a few days we stopped in with the family. My first thought was disappointment in the variety and selection. Years ago when I use to visit a different Dunkin' Donuts on a semi-regular basis I really enjoyed all the different types of donuts from jelly and kreme filled to glazed and chocolate cake. They didnt have chocolate or bavarian kreme filled. None of the chocolate covered cake donuts. Frankly the selection is much better at the Super Walmart down the road. We quickly picked a dozen donuts and headed home eager to dig in. Again, we were only disappointed. The vanilla kreme filled donuts were incredibly skimpy on filling. The glazed donuts were dense and not light and fluffy. Two days later we ended up throwing away 4 left over donuts and that has NEVER happened in this house. The second trip was nearly identical. We were disappointed by the selection and the taste/quality was an even bigger disappointment. I can only assume they must be trying to cut costs by being so skimpy with the donut filling. In passing conversations with others in our neighborhood they've expressed similar experiences. We will not be returning for a third trip. Its back to Walmart and Albertson's donuts until Krispy Kreme builds a store a little closer to our house. Shame on Dunkin' Donuts for being so cheap at the expense of its quality. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I remember being really nervous the first time I ate here, as I was meeting my boyfriend's parents. In fact, I was talking so much that I'm surprised I managed to get any food down me at all. Which would have been a shame, as the food here is phenomenal. I had a mozzarella, roast peppers and sun-dried tomato salad for my starter, which was drizzled in their home-made pesto and was absolutely amazing. The main course was just as tasty, and unlike a lot of risotto dishes in restaurants it didn't leave me feeling really stodgy and too full by the end, whilst still being a decent-sized portion. In fact, everyone's main courses looked gorgeous, but as it was my first time meeting the family I didn't think we were really at the ""nicking food off eachothers' plates"" stage yet, so I couldn't tell you how they tasted. The prices are perfect too. It costs just enough that you know the service and quality of it all is going to be great, but not so pricey that you need a special occasion to justify going. Which is handy, when you liked it as much as I did. Next time I'm out in this area of the city centre in the evening and want somewhre to go eat, I'll definitely be going here. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was EXTREMELY disappointed by this place. I went out to dinner here with a friend before a night out in the club upstairs and received awful service from the start. The hostess suggested we sit at the sushi bar to avoid a wait for a table and then failed to walk us to the back to seat us. We awkwardly wandered through the restaurant until we reached the sushi bar in the back and there we not even any open seat there. Once we were finally seated our waiter brought us water and took our order. We said we wanted to hold off on ordering drinks until we got our food. A different waiter than or original one brought out our food and we were never checked on. Didn't have the chance to order drinks, no one asked how our food was or if we needed anything...we were totally ignored. I ended up asking a third staff member in passing to bring me a drink. A man who appeared to have a managerial position based on the way he was dressed was wandering around our area for awhile and never even picked up on the fact that we were not being helped. About an hour later we had to ask him where our server was just to get our bill and neither apologized to us. I had high expectations for this place based on the prices and reputation but was extremely disappointed and will not be back next time I'm in town. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Our son turns 1 in a few days and was starting to look like the fifth Beatle, so we decided it was past time for a haircut. I've cut his hair a couple times with my clippers, but he won't keep his head still, so I figured it might be better to let a professional try before his birthday pictures. My wife heard about this place from a friend, so we decided to check it out. It was AWESOME. The waiting area has Legos and train sets for younger kids, and several stations of video games for the older ones. For the younger kids, the chair is designed to look like a tiny taxi, which I thought was cute. We made a 2:00 appointment, and when we arrived, we were taken straight back with no waiting. He was WAY past his nap time, and had been fussy for most of the morning, so we were a bit worried about what would happen when he got in the chair, and sure enough, it was time for a tantrum, As soon as she touched his head, he cried and screamed and thrashed about. Our stylist was Bev, who took it in stride, and managed to give him a very stylish cut despite his tantrum. She was very patient and gentle with him, and the friendly smile never left her face. She also managed to do it without cutting him, which I thought was pretty amazing considering his thrashing. It was about $20 for the cut, and though that's a bit pricey for a kid cut, I think it was well worth it for the service and the unique setup. My only advice is to make sure you have an appointment, because they take the appointments before walk-ins. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I love Guy Fieri but if he likes this place, he may need to get his taste buds cleaned, stripped or completely replaced because I ordered New York steak and Shrimp with cole slaw and Baked Beans for sides. My daughter ordered mild chicken fingers and fries and my hubby ordered the New York steak and shrimp with the same sides as me. We also ordered the Antipasto salad and the 1/2 lb shrimp basket with fries. We took everything to go, because we didn't want to sit there with everyone staring at us like we were the next meal. I expected to hear dueling bajos playing any second after walking in there. Let's start with the steaks, they were completely over done. My hubby ordered his med. well and it was murdered beyond belief, dry and not seasoned. Where's the salt and pepper? At least the 5 shrimp that came with it were good but whatever breading was on them was soggy. The cole slaw was good but we never got our baked beans and didn't want to venture back in that dive to tell the chef he made a mistake, it was too scary. The antipasto salad was not what I expected. There was lettuce and lots of it with what I'm assuming to be ablout 1/2 of a diced tomato, less than 7 pieces of ham, about 9 slices of salami, 3 tablespoons of sliced black olives and a handfull of cheese. Not my idea of antipasto salad. The chicken fingers were probably the worst of the bunch. I asked for mild chicken fingers, so what did they do? They took their sauce and sprinkled a tiny amount on the fingers. Who does that? So I'm guessing, if I had ordered hot chicken fingers there would have been a lot more sauce on them? They were a joke. The 1/2lb of shrimp and fries were hard, stale and it should say 'popcorn shrimp' because that's what it is. There's more batter than shrimp on those things and they are hard and dry. The fries tasted old and stale and unsalted. Next time I'll just go to the grocery store and cook at home. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I have been looking for a New York style deli like Katz's where the pastrami is made in house, etc.. Still have not found it but Archies will do in a pinch. I tried the JP Pastrami on rye with mustard and it was big and tasty. I also tried the cheese steak hoagie. The hoagie was big and well made with lettuce, onions, tomato and all but the beef was a bit chewy. Not the highest quality meat but over all a tasty sandwich that was so big I could only eat half. The cole slaw is pretty good too. I will return to try something else. Archies will be my go to deli when I'm not feeling Jason's.

 This company relies on door-to-door sales to generate business. Even though I live in a private, gated community, the salesperson trespassed in the community to ring my doorbell. Since I didn't answer the door, he left a card in my door. I saw him cross the street and continue his door-to-door soliciting. To enter the gated community, the salesperson would have passed a ""no trespassing"" sign. In addition, he disobeyed the sign on my door which reads, ""NO SOLICITING."" The salesperson's name is Zack, and his number is (435) 215-6012. I will never do business with companies that send door-to-door salespersons to gated communities at dinner time. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Eat is definitely a solid addition to downtown and everything ""new and hip"" that's happening in what use to be a crackhead filled area. I love what the chef/owner decided to do with this spot. You never would expect the beautiful attire and fresh herbs through out the restaurant considering it's below some hood apartments. The bright orange chairs, open (small) kitchen, and calligraphy on the walls make you feel like you stepped into a Cali spot. I was bummed that during the week it's breakfast or lunch depending on when you arrive. I had my heart set on the spicy egg dish and the beignets. I will return for this indeed. Our lunch was decent. Average. Nothing bad but nothing spectacular. My favorite part was the fresh avocado on my BLTA, and the in house chips they make. My bf's tomato soup and grilled cheese was good, but didn't stand out. Also I understand the whole ""local, fresh"" thing, but nix the organic lemonade. It was gross. Needed sugar. Blah. Overall I wasn't impressed nor disappointed. The prices were hi. For a whole in the wall on Carson, $12 a sandwich and $4 a lemonade is rough. Ill return in hopes that the breakfast is above average, and because I got love for the mom & pop joints. Not to mention I loved seeing the chef so involved. This was the type of place I want to like, so I am looking forward to round 2. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The renowned Lotus of Siam was a definite stop for the fianc \ u00e9e and me on our trip to Las Vegas. We went for lunch on a Friday afternoon arriving a little before 1 PM. As mentioned by many other reviewers, Lotus of Siam is located in a sketchy-looking strip mall off of Sahara. Unlike some others, though, we thankfully avoided being accosted by panhandlers likely because it was midday in July and we cabbed over from the Hard Rock (approx. $20 ride with tip), which let us off right at the front door. Once inside, Lotus of Siam looked like pretty much every other family run Thai restaurant, although it was, perhaps, a bit larger and definitely more decked out with photos of celebs who've eaten there. For lunch, Lotus of Siam offers an AYCE buffet as well its full menu. Skip the buffet. We looked it over, but it was the standard fare you see on every Thai buffet line. Instead, we elected to go with ordering off of the menu, which was more difficult than you'd think with over 150 various dishes to be found on its encyclopedic menu. We started off with the Nam Kao Tod. The complex m \ u00e9lange of crispy rice, minced pork, green onions, fresh chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice was as tasty as it's been described by countless Yelpers. Next, we had the Kang Ka Noon, a northern style curry made with young jack fruit chunks, with pork. Not being familiar with northern Thai cuisine and jack fruit, we took a leap of faith on this dish. Our faith was rewarded with deliciousness, although it was definitely less spicy or ""curry-like"" than our preconceived notions of a Thai curry dish. Finally, we had the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle. The sea bass was delicately deep fried, then topped with a fresh chili and Thai basil sauce and served over pan fried, flat rice noodles. The fish was moist. The sauce was spicy and flavorful. The noodles were perfectly pan fried, still tender, without dryness or rubberiness. Lotus of Siam may be overhyped, but damn if it wasn't the best Thai food I can ever recall having! The ingredients were fresh and the flavors and colors were bold and bright. Given that there are well over a hundred items we still haven't tried, it's a sure thing that we'll be back. ",0,0,0,0,1

 If you're looking for great service and polite waiters, this isn't the place for you. The point of this restaurant is to be rude in a sarcastic way. I personally loved this place because it was a great experience and I've been waiting to go here for a while. Our waiter wasn't as rude as I thought, but he looked intimidating. He was actually a very nice guy when it came to our food and me asking questions. I guess some people just can't keep themselves in character, but that's okay. After all the rudeness, it's nice to see a nice side. Our waiter made my boyfriend up a hat with something written on it that I've forgotten and for me? He blew up a balloon and shaped it into a dick, LOL!! The food here isn't bad. It was decent and I'd definitely come back. The price for my group of four cost $100 bucks. Roughly about $25 per person, but I can't argue, It's Vegas. Minus one star because he mentioned that my tip wasn't even 10%. For your information, tip isn't part of the meal. It's me being generous enough to even leave extra money for YOU. Even though I'm sure the waiter gets paid a decent amount, there was only four of us. Tip is added with a group of six or more people. Maybe he was being rude since he gets paid to do so, or he was being serious. Whatever it was, it made me a little irritated. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We have lived in Quest Apartments ever since we moved to Henderson over two years ago. The complex is clean, well maintained, has some of the best on-site superintendents you could ask for and the management staff is pretty great. We have enjoyed living here these last couple years and plan on staying until we decide whether or not we will buy a home in the area. The gym is acceptable, clean and does not smell too heavily of body odor, plus it is open 24 hours a day. Some of the machines has TV's which is great, and there are two flat screens in the weight area. If you want, they have the radio too and you can even put in your own workout CD. They have a special room with a TV for those who want to do DVD workouts, and there are plenty of mats in all areas for stretching, yoga, etc. There are tanning beds next to the bathrooms in the clubhouse, sometimes they throw cute little parties during the holidays and there is a Starbucks coffee machine in the complex that we can all use for free. They have the standard computer room and pool tables, very nice and simple. I don't like that the pool is not open for 24 hours like many complexes in the area - maybe this is because of irresponsible tenants or outside teenagers having a rave at the pool all last summer and shutting it down several times due to glass on the floor of the pool and vandalism. I don't like that they send out letters without really thinking about what they're telling us in them - sometimes the letters are illogical and overly abrasive and it gets a bit exhausting. However, I do love that they give you a heads-up when they come in to inspect the fire detectors and sprinklers or when they need to inspect the fire extinguishers in the units themselves. Even though it took them over 5 months, they finally took care of a situation where a tenant allowed their dog to urinate all over the building and not clean up after their pet, but at least it was taken care of and they did power clean the area twice. Their billing system is a bit off - originally we didn't have to pay for garbage removal, now we do, now we have to pay a service fee with each bill and have no way to avoid it, just little changes that never existed before Greystar became the management company for the complex. I do like online billing and payments, but too bad it locks me out all the time and is a hassle to refresh. However, the place is clean and even if the tenants have poor behavior at times, that does not mean the complex is terrible. It will definitely do for now, especially since we pay under $1000 for a two bed/two bath and two walk-in closet apartment! ",0,0,1,0,0

 How awesome is it you get a free margarita with just your check-in! This is not a watered-down drink...it's a delicious and refreshing blended margarita! Anyways... onto the review. As usual, I will split the review is three basic areas: Facilities: Very clean and inviting, with an authentic flair. Sitting in this restaurant makes you forget you are in Vegas! Centrally located, its a great restaurant to visit if you are in the mood for some great food. Service: There is an opportunity in this area. Although our drinks were always full and bussing was prompt, the staff could have been a bit friendlier. Do not expect smiles from your waiter. Food: Probably some of the best Mexican food in Vegas. Any item on the menu is fresh and delicious! Do yourself a favor and try and try either the chicken or the steak with cognac sauce... it is out of this world!!! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I can't believe this place doesn't have 5 stars! Seriously don't listen to people who say this place is bad. I don't believe they're even talking about this restaurant. I am super super picky with food and this place is SO GOOD. It's also super cheap. I've been here at least 30 times. My family is in love with it! For dinner you can get crab legs..yum!! I eat like 2 plates of that. I love the muscles yum yum. The wonton soup is super good. I love many things but I'm not sure what everything is called. The chicken in the stick is deliciousssss. But my absolute favorite thing about this place (which I didn't try till recently) is where you can make your own plate. I put all the meat and lo Meir and tell them to cook it spicy and omgggg it's so good. Incan get full with one plate. You can put a lot of a little bit. Try it! The only things I don't like is..it is always crowded and the sushi is nasty. But everything else is pretty great. Especially finishing with ice cream! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Since it has opened, Monsoon Siam has quickly become one of my favorites in the area, and it's now on my regular visit rotation. Although their service is good, the staff is nice, and the prices are reasonable, I keep coming back here for two main reasons: The dishes, and how fast they come to the table. Concerning the food: There's a lot more variety on the menu than one would expect. Some of the specials are interesting and unique concoctions, like the lemongrass tofu and tofu angel. Otherwise, there's a lot of classics to choose from as well, like the Pad Thai, and the selection of curries. One aspect I really like is that in the dishes where you can choose your protein, you can pick a tofu BALL, which is different from your regular old tofu in that it's deep-fried and packed with herbs. I very much recommend trying those at least once. And all of this food comes to you FAST. Like I put in an order with 1 other person, and the dishes came to us in 4 minutes. It's almost too fast, because it makes me wonder if they're even made to order. But they're delicious regardless, so who cares? The speed of the service always makes me consider Monsoon Siam when i'm in a pinch for time and am feeling too lazy to cook. With all that said, I can say that even if you think that there's too many Thai places in Madison, Monsoon Siam is still well worth your time to check out. ",0,0,0,0,1

 It is hard to go wrong with Mortons! I've been a Mortons customer off and on for years and have never had a bad experience. I like the fact this particular restaurant is just off the strip. We have never had trouble getting in, even without reservations. As a Vegas local, I have probably been there 4-5x in the past year mostly special occasions like birthdays, family celebrations, valentines day, etc. A few times we went to other restaurants but had issues that caused us to change our minds upon arrival such as table issues, customer service, etc. When in doubt or in a jam we always go back to Mortons. The staff is very friendly and shows real quality customer service. It is a very classy romantic feel in the restaurant. Everytime I have been there I have felt important and welcome. I love the fact they even take a picture at your table for you, and give it to you to preserve the memory. Its a nice personalized touch. It is hard to find something bad on the menu. The oysters are great, the seafood ocean sampler platter is off the hook a mix of scallops wrapped in bacon, oysters rockefeller, stuffed shrimp and crab cakes. The Bone in Rib Eye cooked medium is still one of the best steaks I have ever had. Any dish with the shrimp/pasta is great also. No doubt I will be back in the future. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This was our second visit, but the first time I can review the food. On our first visit we stood in line for about 20 min to order then another 20 after we paid when we overhead the grill cook tell one of the line prep guys that they were out of ribs, rib tips, brisket, and chicken. Since we ordered three of the four, we asked for a refund and they were very nice about it and also gave us free meal cards for our wait and the inconvenience. That helped us decide to make the 60 mile round trip journey a second time. I was amped to try this great BBQ after all the positive reviews I read and am sad to say I was disappointed. The sauce comes from big Smart & Final jugs which is surprising. Neither the spicy or regular sauce were very good. The cole slaw had a very off putting sour taste. The cornbread was just okay, as was the pulled pork, but nothing I would come back for. However, I very much enjoyed the hot link. For me that was the shining star of my Styrofoam box. The BF had the ribs and found those lacking as well as the mac salad, which was not very good. I do not think we will be coming back to this establishment. ",0,0,1,0,0

 For me, Paradise Bakery is a poor man's Panera. I don't think it's nearly as organized, friendly or tasty as Panera, although the price is much better at Paradise. Paradise Bakery is disappointing in a few ways. First, I really really hate when places just have pictures of sandwiches on the display board and provide absolutely zero written description. Oh, I see I'm just supposed to guess what is on that sandwich that has a picture in the most inconvenient spot in the whole freaking place. Wonderful. Second, the caesar salad is horrible. I took my first bite yesterday and instantly remembered why I swore I would never order another one from Paradise again. I managed to choke most of it down, but seriously what is wrong with their caesar dressing??? It has a very funny, and not in a good way, taste to it. Also the croutons are not very tasty either. Third, they completely use too much dressing on their salads. Excuse me, but can I have some lettuce to go with that dressing?? And finally, for a bakery, I don't particularly find the cookies and pastries I have tried to be all that amazing. The chocolate/white chocolate chip cookie I tried yesterday was a bit on the dry side and not very chewy/soft at all. Boo. The two bright spots are 1) the price...my salad and medium drink was $6.23 which isn't a bad deal at all and 2)the number of tables outside this location where you can escape the office to enjoy a nice, leisurely lunch on a beautiful Arizona day. But if you are craving a salad or sandwich, there are better options in the downtown area. ",0,1,0,0,0

 When I booked our room at Mandalay Bay, it came with a deal for two complimentary tickets to a list of shows. We decided to see Zumanity since neither my cousin or I had seen a Cirque du Soleil show and we were so so so excited! Zumanity is located inside New York New York towards the back of the casino. The theater itself was comfortable, intimate, and all the plush, red colors gave off a very sexy vibe. We sat in the balcony (row EE) and we could see everything! Pretty good for free tickets ;) The show itself is more on the burlesque side and not only features acrobats and dancers, but also some fun crude humor. The show is very sensual, sexy, and fun. The live band was awesome! It's definitely not for anyone who is prude or easily offended and not appropriate for kids. In fact, they advertise their show as 21+. Some of my favorite acts were the acrobats and tissue dancers! So beautiful! However, the highlight of the show was the middle-aged lady who pretty much mounted one of the dancers and made out with his body...hilarious! I honestly wasn't sure what to expect out of Zumanity but I must say I was pleasantly surprised! It was so much fun and definitely a highlight of our Vegas trip. Keep an open mind and don't hesitate to see this show ;) ",0,0,0,0,1

 I came here for a UYE months ago and yes I'm double dipping for reviews but this is a review for just Novecento since everything that was served was on the normal menu. Their pizzas are amazing and so are their salads. Put them all together talk about one of the better things I've eaten. 5 star easily for their pizzas and salads maybe even a 6th star if they had them. Order anything and everything you wont leave unsatisfied. They also have a good selection of gelato and other items, they were ok. The kitchen is open and so is the view of their wood burning pizza oven. The one or two things I didn't care for was 1 the interior decor and feel of the restaurant. Pre-Yelp days I probably have walked in then out but that's me being picky. And 2 the way it seemed like the chef was talking down other pizza restaurants just because ""they didn't go to Italy for training to cook pizza"" personally I don't care about that, all I care for is excellent tasting pizza which they already have. Also for you Yelpers that are closer to Henderson there is a Novecento Pizzeria opening up. The sign is already up. Located on South Eastern next to Republic Kitchen & Bar or in the same plaza as BJ's. LOL I'm slacking once again, they're already open. Both of their locations are no where near me so it won't be on my usual pizza spot rotations wish they were though. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is probably my favorite buffet I've been to on The Strip. The buffet is one of the simpler looking buffets compared to the other buffets of it's caliber in the area. It's also the cheaper option for the quality of food you get (imo), w/ lunch priced at $22 and dinner at around $37 (both + tax) on the weekdays. And heads up this is a review of their weekday menu, not their weekend (which I understand comes with more items and a higher price). The service is good. The variety is standard. That is, they have salad, sushi, cold bar, prime rib, chicken, turkey, a semblance of chinese food, pizza, pasta, seafood, dessert, etc. If you're looking for something totally out there and exotic your'e not going to find it at this buffet (and I don't why you'd look at buffets for that type of stuff anyways). If you want more variety buffets such as the Bacchanal at Caesars will be for you. However, the reason why they're my favorite buffet is because of the food. The Good: 1.) The prime rib here is the best between Bacchanal, Wynn, and Bellagio. They're smaller, but from what I've seen and eaten the prime rib is better seasoned and cooked better than the other buffets. 2.) Lamb lollipops. The first 2 batches were really good with the proper medium rare available, but alas as time went on they overcooked it consistently. 3.) The sea bass, which was tender and had decent flavor. 4.) Smoked salmon is offered both lunch and dinner 5.) There were split King Crab legs on a weekday dinner. Score! The Whatever/Bad: Sushi was whatever to bad (per-the-usual) Turkey was going on dry, but okay, the rotisserie chicken was decent, and dessert was also decent, but mostly whatever. I mostly avoid the Chinese line (at all the buffets there) and you need to check to make sure the piece of fish you are grabbing is overcooked or not. My method, poke it with the tongs. If it flakes easily than take it, if it is solid, its overcooked. In short, the Bellagio may not have the most varied, exotic selection, or the prettiest decor, but they make food that I want to eat and do enough of it well that I'd want to come back. That and the price is pretty affordable to cheap if you're looking for a good upscale buffet to eat at. ",0,0,0,1,0

Everything was impeccable, down to the wallpaper, amenities, service, decor, rooms, staff. No detail was left unworked. Even the crystals in all the lights in the hallways made me smile as they twinkled. The bars and shops inside this hotel were beautiful, except everything was honking expensive so I didn't really buy anything except drinks. The pools are beautiful, the spa offers deliciously decadent services and massages. I have no idea if they have a gym because I didn't go looking for one because I'm on vacay! The room was like a mini apartment, careful for the mini bar though because if you move the bottles they'll try and charge you! Make sure to check! The bed was super comfy, the tv that controlled everything in the room was really cool, the balcony view overlooking the strip was stunning.

 Wow! I read the positive reviews and Yelp featured email write-up and had to go grab some great bbq! Sigh... Not what I expected. OK, their customer service is top-notch. Very nice people and a very clean place to eat bbq. Also, their ribs are tender. Nice and smokey. Here's the problem: the bbq sauce. I'm saucey! I need mollasses-based bbq sauce. Hogs Heaven uses tomato-based bbq sauce. Worse, there is no choice in sauces. Even more awful: you can't get extra bbq sauce. You're stuck with the one sauce that they provide on the ribs.

 I was introduced to Fukuburger through a magazine article. After reading the article which specifically mentioned the Tamago burger, I knew I had to head down to Streats to find this unique burger. I'd have to say, I haven't eaten anything like it in my life. It was truly a distinctly asian tasting burger. I was shocked, surprised, and mesmerized, all at the same time. It was also messy- but what do you expect from a burger with a drippy egg stacked inside of it? The service was super fun. I love how they had you come up with a nickname for your order- that was a nice touch. And the girl taking the orders was super cute- that certainly helps business, I bet! While it's not something I'll be craving, it definitely was a unique and incredible burger. If you're looking for something that's totally crazy and out there, Fukuburger is it. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I really wanted to like this place, because I have fond memories of its sister restaurant in Mt. Lebo. No such luck, I went there last night for the first time. It's located on E. Carson St., which is good because the s. side needs more sushi options than nakama. The first thing that struck me was when we walked in there was a ""boom box"" blasting mid 80's love songs. You know, Journey, Pat Benatar and the like. We walked in and were greeted by a friendly host who sat us at a nice table in the corner. It was crowded which is normally a good sign. The service was prompt for the drinks. We got a bottle of reasonablypriced chardonnay. It took forever for our sushi, which was disappointing. The warm towels are also a nice touch. I really didn't care for my sashimi overall. The way it was sliced was very unattractive to me. It was big hunks of fish that didn't look all that appetizing the way it was presented. The salmon was good once I cut the pieces into smaller bits. It was fresh for sure. The albacore tuna had a weird color to it and while it tasted okay again the way it was cut was unappetizing. I also tried the conch, which was okay but probably not the best thing to order sashimi style, better in a ceviche I'd guess. My friend she ordered the rolls. I'm not a big roll guy, but I tried a few. The Philly roll was pretty good and reasonably priced, but I'll pass on the cream cheese with my sushi if it's up to me. The lobster roll wasn't that good. The lobster had too much mayo and we barely touched it. The softshell crab rolls were okay, but I only tried a little. Again, I'm not the best to judge rolls because overall I don't care for them. My friend said she didn't think much of them and she has tried many ""sushi"" rolls in her time. The prices were okay, but maybe a bit high. The atmosphere kind of sucked again with the blaring 80's music. I probably won't go back again, too many other options. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I Love Sushi is OK. Not bad, but really just ok. I've had so many people tell me its so good and...eh. I was totally underwhelmed when I went. It's definitely a cute place, and their menu is huge. But the menu items aren't that different from each other. I found myself flipping the menu over a bunch to see what the difference between a couple rolls were. I think it would be good if you are going with a large group and you're more concerned with having fun than eating awesome sushi. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I had terrible customer service at this location yesterday. My daughter wanted to by a bra that had a sign with a picture of the same bra and it said $29.99. When we went to pay the bra rang up twice the price and when we showed the sign to the clerk she took it down and said it should have been taken down a while ago and that we couldn't have that price. She then tried to say it wasn't for that bra even though it is the exact one in the picture. She said the description is for a different one that isn't the picture. That didn't even make sense. We left with nothing after being told we had to pay a different price then was clearly advertised. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This review is based on a single order of Fried Pickles at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest. The pickles were served as sliced discs lightly battered in likely cornmeal, and at the time I found them to be excellent-tasting when dipped in the mild, smooth pink remoulade provided. But I was disappointed that no tomato ketchup was available as a second dip, so had to apply barbecue sauce instead. A goodly amount of pickle slices was supplied, and it took me awhile to finish them all--which was a good thing, because I could savor each disc while I waited for my sandwich to be prepared at the Devilicious food truck nearby. I thought the price for this appetizer was also fair for a lip-smackin' starter (based on food truck fare never seeming to be low in cost). ",0,0,0,1,0

 Went to Re Public Wednesday evening, it was a hot mess! $5.00 to park normal, no entrance fee cool. expensive drinks, the norm for downtown Charlotte. Diverse crowd, cool. Music was cool. But you mean to tell me your rope off ALL tables for VIP and have a 3 bottle minimum, on a Wednesday? Insane.com So the only seating in 37 degree weather was outside with a heater? Ummm aint nobody got time to pay to sit down on the inside of a club. Literally understand, NO interior seating without paying, not at the bar, not anywhere! Must I remind establishments that Charlotte has a tremendous turnover in Clubs, especially downtown. Quick think of 1 spot downtown that hasn't flipped 5 times in a short amount of time! This is why. You make it too difficult to have a good time. Overzealous security, no seating, maybe not New York prices, but may I remind you that this is Charlotte....Re-Public will be closed soon enough and on to the next. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I went here with the family for some ""amazing"" nachos as advertised. The ambiance is that of a bar, with additional tables for families. TVs everywhere and the place is LOUD. We ordered the cheeseburger nachos and the BBQ pulled pork nachos. Our waitress was nice and attentive, and we did not have to wait for drinks or refills. When the food came out I was a little surprised. A large pile of nachos covered in about everything you can think of. The cheeseburger nachos were really quite good, even my picky 7 year old liked them. The plating is something to be desired, on an oval skillet-type platter that is too small for the amount of food, and many a nacho ended up in the laps of my kids. The BBQ pulled pork nachos were not that great, but only because it was WAY too much. You need a gallon of water to swallow five bites, and the BBQ sauce and cheese are overwhelming to the palate. Overall, not bad, but not spectacular. I would go again if I absolutely had to. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The food was just very typical Pittsburgh Italian food. Same sauces with regular pastas. Huge portions of overly garlic-y food. Nothing truly to write home about. I just wasn't impressed. The restaurant was an old pharmacy. So, it is tiny. I think there were 15 tables. I felt crammed in and there were only two other tables with customers. The waitstaff kept going into a curtained off area just beside our table to get supplies. The coffee was in a huge carafe. The atmosphere just wasn't pretty and cozy as it should have been with such a tiny place. The food wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. I'm not sure if go specifically to Crafton for this place.

 Dear Jesse T, Thank you for your quick reply. In response to your comment about the hotel room mix-up. I was aware that this was the reason the keys weren't working, as I said previously my issue was the lack of concern and initiative on the part of the staff. If you read closely, I believe I said that having new room keys wasn't a problem, but the fact that no one made any effort to give us our room keys and instead we had to go to the front desk late at night after finding out ours no longer worked, was an issue to me. I will no longer be staying at your hotel, this is simply advice so you might retain long-term customers in the future. You have a nice hotel, but with that comes clientele that have certain customer service expectations. In order to help you to check the wifi situation I will tell you we were staying in a room on the first floor to the right of the lobby. However, I will not tell you what room to ""ensure the proper housekeeper is spoken to"". This is an overall problem and not the responsibility of one person trying to do their job. In fact, if you assign rooms to certain housekeepers this could in fact be part of the reason it is not a team effort to first clean rooms with a sign on the door... No, it was an overall issue with cleanliness. My mother pointed out one afternoon that the cigarette butt she had seen the previous evening in the walkway to our room was still there. We were all a bit disgusted when we came back hours later and it was STILL there, even though there was a cleaning lady nearby. Perhaps instead of chastising individual employees for a single dirty room there should be an overall standard of cleanliness for the entire hotel by which all employees are judged. Lastly, I understood the ""deal"" you were offering, but it was a Monday night and the room was free. We were agitated and obviously not returning to your hotel. Even making a slight allowance such as: ""how about if we still have plenty of rooms by tomorrow afternoon I'll give you the extra night"" would have perhaps made us reconsider our negative view on the service at your hotel. Instead the woman behind the desk very coldly and rudely informed us of the ""rules"" you just stated and then turned away. My sister lives in Scottsdale and used to recommend your hotel, but after seeing the way her family was treated and knowing how many better options there are, she told us she would never recommend the hotel again. Yes, you may have lost one room for one night, but you may have gained 20 new visitors to your hotel. I think a shrewd cost-benefit analysis may have put up with a small loss for a big future gain. Again, this is all just advice, take it or don't, we most certainly won't be returning to check up on your progress. ",1,0,0,0,0

The tempura consists of a piece of Shrimp and a few vegetables in this case sweet potato (amazing) and cucumber (good but sweet potato is my favorite after pumpkin which is extra amazing - side note).

 Out of the nice steakhouse's that I've been to in Montreal, this is the best in my opinion. Moishe's is expensive, but it has no atmosphere and the steak is unacceptably inconsistent for the price. Gibby's has a great atmosphere, with a full restaurant that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside with the low ceilings . The food is consistent and worth the bigger price tag. Servers are friendly and attentive, fulfilling the expectations that you usually bring to a place like this. They also have great seafood options if you're not in the mood for beef (or lamb, etc.).

 When me and my friend first started at OTF- WE LOVED IT! The energy from the class and from some of the trainers was not what we had experienced at other gyms. Then it slowly started going downhill as we attended more and more. When we first started, we were able to put our bags behind the desk because the lockers couldn't hold more than a pair of shoes. Then one day we came in and they had installed a board where you could no longer go behind to the desk to store your stuff. When we asked one of the ladies behind the counter if new lockers were going to be installed to fit our gym bags, she shrugged her shoulders and said no and that we would just have to store our stuff in our cars. We came from work everyday so they wanted us to change, go out to our cars and put our stuff away and then come back. Do they not understand security in that? People watch cars to see what owners do and they could be watching us go outside everyday to put our bags away. Brave, the manager at Dana Park, should not be the manager; period the end. She is incredibly rude. My friend couldn't make it one day because she was stuck at work so she called and Brave picked up the phone. She was asking if she would be charged since it wasn't her fault that she was caught at work and Brave made up some story about how she would have to contact Corporate to see if they could waive the $10 late cancellation charge. Uh okay, Brave. Which by the way isn't even her real name. Most of the trainers there have fake names because they think it is clever and funny. There were a couple trainers that I did enjoy taking classes from like Jason, Chael, and Jesse.The room is also very small and everyone was always sweaty and running into each other. Also, some days it feels like a daycare due to children waiting for their parents in the small front entrance. They do not have childcare services and don't expect the gals behind the desk to be any type of help at all. To say the least, I will stay with OTF but will be trying a new location. ",0,1,0,0,0

 NO SERVICE, NO SALSA, NO SMILE We had walked by several times and finally decided to stop one night when the music wasn't so loud and the bar wasn't packed. We didn't want to fight for a table so it was a good time, late at night. All we wanted was chips and salsa. We sat at the bar but quickly grew impatient as we weren't noticed. Once we finally received our menus the bartender had left to do something. I forget what they were asking for the chips and salsa but we'd been told it was just one salsa, (no ""hot"" option; no ""verde"" option) so for whatever the price was we didn't think it was worth it and ended up walking out.

 Once again, I have a problem with a distinct lack of customer service. I went to this location and picked out several items of clothing to purchase. The reason I usually love this store is because I get weekly mailers with discount options to bring in. Additionally, I had Kohl's Cash on me and a gift card due to a previous return. I got up to the cash register to pay for my items and the woman was so unpleasant, she couldn't even take the time to smile at me. The way I figure it is if you hate your job that much...quit. Especially when you work in a customer service fueled industry like retail. The woman finished inputting all of my purchases and I handed her the Kohl's cash I had, which she immediately pointed out was expired. One rule I've recently found out was that any Kohl's store will honor their Kohl's Cash for up to seven days after the expiration date, which I told her. She rolled her eyes and called a manager to come over and help her out. The manager showed up and fiddled with the keys for a bit before he exasperatedly looked up and me and said...""look, we can't really honor these things if you don't give them to us until after everything's already been totaled."" You are kidding, right? It's a simple as pasting on a fake smile and asking the customer, ""and, before I ring you up, do you have any savings today?"" Especially in a store that deals so stringently in savings material. He was even more agitated when I asked him to re-ring every item to include our savings. We ended up with a total saved close to $150.00. Why would I just eschew that? Thanks for making my decision to go to another Kohl's so much easier. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I like Papa's usually but this one really fell short of late! Seriously, I've never had so much trouble getting someone to make a half vegetarian half meat pizza! It's not rocket science. I understand that people make mistakes but I had ordered from them they had to remake it three times and still got it all wrong. When I called the same person who took my order (I swear she must have been high), she began to argue with me saying that it was correct and had to go ""talk to the manager"" three times. She was going to charge me anyways!!! I could not believe the poor customer service! I explained to her that I had a vegetarian in the house and have always ordered at least half if not all of the pizzas veggie. FINALLY the manager got on the phone and he ended up MAILING me a free pizza cert, in the meantime I had to run out and buy a frozen pizza because we had waited an hour for it to arrive and I wasn't going to wait for them to re-make it again! In short, I like Papa's normally, but I worked for a pizza place in my younger years and the last thing you do when a customer says a pizza is wrong (and they haven't touched it), is defend your order-taking abilities (or lack thereof)! Who cares pizza girl?! It costs the company like a dollar to waste a pizza, so just make another!!!!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I've been to Flemings probably a dozen times in San Diego and Rancho Cucamonga. This is my first time to the Las Vegas location. The set up, size, vibe, and service is as consistent as it gets, but that's not necessarily a good thing. I'm fine with the service and ambiance for the most part. My only issue is the noise. Tough to enjoy your steak and company when all you hear is everyone's conversation. Regardless, I still had a decent dinner with the gf here the other night. As for my meal, I have never deviated from their 8 oz petite filet mignon. Before dinner, I scoped out the menu and contemplated on something different. But guess what? I chose the petite filet again. The steak was decently sized, but was a little disappointed on the overall taste. I got my steak medium-well and thought it was too pink. As for taste, I thought it was just ""A-Ok"". For a pinkish steak, I thought it tasted burnt. I don't know if it was Fleming's or if my taste in steaks have changed. Price is about what you expect at a steakhouse. However, I've had better steaks with the same price points. Overall, will I be back? I'm sure I will one day. Maybe next time I'll try their lobster or seafood. PS: Their Mushrooms Ravioli is phenomenal. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I'm not as thrilled with Satori the second time around. We ordered Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon rolls with our order. When our food came to our table we noticed something odd about the rolls. They had crab in them. My girlfriend doesn't eat shell fish, and that's part of the reason we ordered these specific rolls (which we had ordered last week and they came out normal). The waiter and manager were very friendly and good about changing up the order, but they seemed to believe that crab was a regular ingredient in these rolls. That's something that I have never heard of. My girlfriend used to be a regular at Satori for years, and she cannot remember another time crab was ever mixed into the salmon or tuna. We ended up settling on ordering regular tuna and salmon rolls, and having sriracha sauce mixed into them. Not as good, but a workable substitute for me. The inconsistency is a bit of turn off. While I don't mind when restaurants try to make a standard item their own, it's a little scary that they add something that can be a common dietary or allergy restriction for many people without warning. I also find it weird that I ordered something I had just a week ago, and comes out differently. Satori is still cheap. Still decent. But you may want to ask what's in the roll before ordering it.

 Horrible experiences with the staff keeps me from rating this store any better. They carry what you would expect any auto store to have. The staff, however, needs a reality check. Anyone with basic vehicle knowledge can be hired at Auto Zone. Two of their employees, a clerk and a manager, seems to think that they know better than an actual trained mechanic who owns his own shop with an awesome reputation. My mechanic even called to explain to the manager that they sold a faulty merchandise but the manager blatantly refused to speak with him. She went on to explain to my boyfriend and I how their $100 dollar system is very accurate and that our mechanic is wrong. She even tried to have us seek a second opinion. In the end, she ended up honoring their warranty with an extremely arrogant attitude. As anyone can guess, our mechanic was correct and the problem was fixed.

 J Crew is the proverbial mixed bag. Maybe I'm spoilt. When I lived in the Philadelphia area, the King of Prussia team was exceptional. They knew the true art of selling, which is establishing a connection and offering a variety of choices. Perhaps the Scottsdale store is simply understaffed or the people aren't invested in their jobs. I am not certain what it is. Every time I have visited--and I like to give a store several times to wow me--the employees are rushing around or chatting amongst themselves, just at two extremes. No one seems very happy to be there. At the end of both extreme is faulty customer service. There is no sense of urgency or even of building. Grab a shirt and you might wander around with it for a long time before someone wants to put it on the fitting room door. The only time you do draw attention is when you scoop up a bunch of items, and then, the associates seem to be wanting to fight for the sale. I love me some J. Crew, no doubt. They are classic and yet current. I would love shopping here more if the Scottsdale store could shore up their level of service with what the KOP location is doing. ",0,1,0,0,0

 When this place was first opened, I wrote it off... It seemed a little bland at first, despite a nice blue paintjob....and the crowd just was generally older... Not really my scene. Then, some fellow Yelpers had a meetup here prior to a movie at Fountain Park and I was pleasantly surprised to see that this set-up was pretty decent. I have since returned numerous times and it's unexpected favourite. Drinks can be a little above average price but affordable, I think the Fountain's best feature is the ambiance. If you have had a long day and you'd like to unwind with a nice cold drink, this is the place to be. A very nice place where there isn't insanely loud music and you can actually talk. It also doubles as a great place to hang out prior to movies. On to the food, I LOVE their fries... So big and crispy and it comes in a pot... My friends are a fan of its fruit ciders.

 *****WATCH OUT FOR THE MENU ITEMS INCLUDING SEAFOOD!!!!!!!!***** When a friend came to visit from out of town for my birthday, I was excited to take him to the BBQ place at Red Rocks Casino that all my friends had been raving about. Starving, we arrived a the BBQ restaurant only to find out that the wait was over an hour. Because we were so hungry, we made the decision to try Hachi. When we asked the hostess about a wait for a table she stated that there was no wait and we would be sat right away. We told her that we would like a table, to which she replied, ""sure, that will not be a problem. If you could just wait, you will be sat right after the couple that is before you"", motioning to the couple looking at the menu by the hostess station. Confused and hungry, we stood and waited at the restaurant's entrance in the casino. Approximately five minutes later we were sat and told our waiter would arrive shortly to take our drink orders. We were handed menus that include three pages of pricey food items, but were without any list of available beverages. The design and decor of the restaurant was impressive and unique. The place was far from full and from the looks of it, slow, because we were sat right next to the waiter station. Apologetic, our waiter arrived 8-10 minutes later and handed us one drink menu. He asked us for our drink order and what type of water we would like to drink. Not having much time to look over the menu, I ordered the restaurant's pineapple version of a Dark and Stormy while my friend ordered a Red Bull and Vodka. To the bartender's credit, both drinks were very good. I decided to try the $22 chicken teriyaki and my friend chose to eat an assortment of their equally overpriced signature sushi rolls which included both shrimp and fish items. During the meal the service was excellent and our waters were never empty and our plates were cleared promptly by a polite busser. All was well until about two hours later when my friend became very ill. He was up all night with FOOD POISONING and sick the following day, my birthday, trying to recover. A little quick to blame the food at Hachi for being the actual food that was the source of his food poisoning you ask? Well, to that I would say it would have been impossible for it to not be their food, because my friend had not eaten at all that day or the day before as he was getting over a cold. He had slept in and on the plane and had not even eaten a snack (this explains how hungry he was arriving at the casino). And if it was a stomach flu I would have gotten the flu because he had used my fork to eat some of my chicken dish. This restaurant ruined his vacation to Las Vegas as he spent the next three days wishing he was dead in my house. It also ruined my birthday as I spent the next three days taking care of him.

 I've been here a few times and every time my experience was very different. The first time we went late on a Friday night as a friend knew that local musicians get together in the bottom bar to have a jamming session after they have finished playing at other pubs and venues. This was a great night and I'd give it 5 stars. SO much fun and we even got to have a wee shot on the guitars!!! The second time I went in for a quick drink in the top bar which is not the most classy of venues. Rammed in there at 7pm on a Friday night beside older locals was not a nice experience. If I could give zero stars then that would even be too much!!! I still couldn't get the memory of that first night out of my head so on the third occassion I had visitors over from foreign lands. I wanted to give them a taste of Scotland so decided to take them along in the hope that the musicians would be back. There were musicians but in the bar upstairs. They played their own local songs with lots of slang words so of course my friends didn't have a clue what they were on about. When I requested that they play 'Caledonia' I got laughed at and if looks could kill then I'd have been lying in a pool of blood in the middle of the floor!!! I've now come to the conclusion that every night is different and you have to just appreciate the memories. I doubt I'll be giving this place another chance. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Beauty is only skin deep. Conn's service/repair facility is horrible to deal with and the salesman that sold us an extended warranty for a laptop lied about having to send a defective item in for service. We were told we could exchange the laptop for a new one if it failed and that's isn't what happened. They have had the laptop for 9 days and counting and haven't even looked at it yet. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I love this place. When you think of a Hawaiian BBQ kind of place, I'm sure L&L might come into mind at first, but once you try Ross J's, your Hawaiian food referral is switched. Starting off with their service, the staff is friendly and gives off their local Hawaiian feel. (I'm from HI myself) I love the locals service. They're all very welcoming and patient, especially when their lines are longer. However, I feel they're somewhat under-staffed during certain shifts. I've eaten here about 4 times and I cannot get enough of the garlic chicken with gravy... What I love is that the gravy isn't too salty, so the flavor of the chicken is what you're tasting with the compliment of gravy. I did try their loco moco, just because my boyfriend ordered the garlic chicken already. Their pork patty to eggs to rice ratio is right on the dot. The seating is limited depending on the hour of your visit. If you're dining in, they serve your entree on large plates. Overall, all visits were worth the drive and money. Youre leaving with a happy stomach :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place missed the mark on so many levels for us. I'll start with the service, since this was the only great part of the experience. Our waiter was very friendly and spent time with us going over the menu. He was attentive, brought us everything we asked for and offered to replace my soup when I didn't like it. He gets the 1 star I gave here. Here's my list of the bad: - What the hell is that wall of dead birds? - The wood fired beets - tasted more like rubber lumps, no wood fired taste. - The pan fried corn - yes, it's pan fried corn, my bad for expecting some spices in there. - The onion soup - overly salty and has a strong, unidentifiable flavor. - The scallops - nothing special at all. - The prices - for what we paid, I would expect to be spoon fed while being fanned with palm leaves. Really a said combo of inflated prices and mediocre food you could prepare at home for nothing. And be forewarned: Everything is a la carte. Ordering scallops? That's $20, and then you may add a side for $7. What a joke. Bring a fat wallet of money you were thinking of setting on fire and low expectations and you should leave happy. ",1,0,0,0,0

 They shrank my daughter's pants so that the polyester lining was hanging out the bottoms and then told me that they would refund me $4. The outfit cost $65 and they refused to give me my money back. The lady working there asked me for a receipt for the purchase of my outfit and when I showed it to her, she replied ""Me speak no English"" after she was speaking it just fine. Finally the owner came down and told me he would give me $35 back and that he was sorry. Horrible service. They also ruined another dress where the lining hangs out. I am not even sure they take the clothes out to clean them. She uses a steamer and an ironing board. NEVER AGAIN. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The coffee is decent and so is the atmosphere. I like the decor of the place and there is definitely some character. Also, you can tell this place supports local events because anyone is pretty much free to post a flyer on the wall. It's hard to find outlets (if any?) so for those equipped w/ electronics and need to work, this may not be the most optimal place. However, if you just need a temporary escape from your campus buildings, kiva han is a great meet up place. There is definitely more seating than the Starbucks across the street (two floors) but the wait at Kiva may just persuade you to take the less decent option at S-bux. The sandwiches and wraps are blah but I will vouch for the chili. I'm sure it's not difficult to fuck up chili, but it tastes realllllly good here. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I finally gave in and moved from my Verizon Crackberry ""worldphone"" to an AT&T iPhone. My purchasing experience was very pleasant, considering that I stopped in to the store at a very quiet time - I was the only one there on Sunday afternoon. This gave the salesperson (Courtney) plenty of opportunity to focus on me and my transaction. It took only about 25 minutes, which was pretty good considering that I knew exactly what I wanted. Porting over my number was easy! Parking here can be a small amount of trouble, but if Panera is busy, you can use the lower lot and just climb the steps. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Service was for the most part prompt but I think that's about all the positive I can say. Actually the coffee was good too. We went here for breakfast the other day as I saw the 4 star review.

The kicker was within an hour of leaving, we both became sick. Not crazy vomiting sick, but nauseous like you feel like your going to vomit sick - gurgling belly with heart burn.

 We stopped in on July 4th for lunch. We were told we could sit wherever we wanted. The server walked over and asked for a drink order. He later brought chips and let us know they had a salsa bar. We walked over and they have a big selection. We tried several and they were very tasty. We ordered the fried quesadilla with chicken and beans and rice and an order of guacamole. The quesadilla was amazing. The chicken was cooked perfectly and it was spicy. The refried beans were the best I have ever had, I just wished the side was bigger than the small cup it was served in. Everything was excellent, except the service was a little slow. We had to ask for water, silverware and an extra plate a couple of times before it was brought over.

 YAY Paris Buffet!!! This is the one thing I was so excited about when I agreed to go to Vegas with the family--breakfast at the Paris Buffet. The price is very reasonable--$15.99. And, once again, because of my parents and their rewards card, we didn't have to stand in an hour-long line... Now, I am a huge fan of the breakfast meats. Any variety, and shape, and size. Almost every station had at least one type of breakfast meat. Better yet, one entire station was all breakfast meats. I was overwhelmed!! I took a huge breath, then made the smart choice to sample some foods before I committed and took a giant portion. One of my faves was a beef and turkey sausage with sweet potato and maple syrup. It's got it all in one casing!! So yummy. I also greatly enjoyed the poached eggs Basquaise. It was a poached egg with a really delicious, somewhat spicy tomato sauce. My breakfast dessert was a crepe with Nutella and blueberries--YUMMO!! And it's always nice when the coffee's good. That way, when you bundle up to face the freezing cold of winter-time Vegas, you've got some good caffeine in your veins. Cheers to the Paris Buffet!! ",0,0,0,1,0

 A cute restaurant at the Paris Resort & Casino for people who are looking for decent French food, without heading to France. The ambiance is very French, as it is set up like an authentic French Bistro with beautiful high ceilings and mirrors around the leather booths. I loved the feel of the place and was excited to try the food. We decided on this place because Kelly and I decided to treat ourselves to some steak frites after a night of partying... and let me tell you, it was the best idea ever. Luckily for us, we were able to get a table seated outside so that we could enjoy watching the Bellagio fountains. It was nice to sit outside like we were at a cafe! The wait here can get pretty long, but I guess it also depends on where you want to sit, and how many people are you in your party. The service here was excellent and the food was delicious. The portion was so big that I was able to take some back to my room and finish it later. We both enjoyed our experience here and I can't wait until I can make it back again!

 I have been going to this big o tires for the past 4 years and have probably spent about $2,000 + on tires and services. They were great about getting me tires and all but the second I come back to get a tire replaced on warranty because the tread was separating from the tire, they pull out the fine print of my warranty (it was the tiniest print you've ever seen) and asked for my service records for every 5,000 miles since I bought the tire. It had been about 20,000 miles so I would have needed to produce at least 4 records of service. I'm sure this is company policy and they are following protocol but seriously, 20,000 miles and the tread is separating and you won't honor the warranty on an obviously defective tire? We'll here I am telling my story and will never go back to that store or any other big o tire ever again. I'll make sure all my friends know about this as well. A little customer service would have gone a long way here but they blew it. Walmart came to the rescue and I got a new tire for 1/2 the price the ""offered"" to replace the bad tire for. Yup, never again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We're in the area and it's time for dinner. Heading into the closed off section for diners, we sat in a booth. We chose to order from the dinner entree section of the menu, which is only available from 4 pm to 11 pm. All entrees are served with soup or salad, vegetables, garlic bread; and a choice of a baked potato, mashed potatoes or fries. * BBQ Pork Ribs ""Slow cooked with our own sweet savory sauce."" ($18) - The Husband ate up all his pork ribs, along with the sides. * New York Steak ""14 oz. steak, lightly seasoned, broiled to your liking, topped with mushrooms sauteed in fresh garlic and herbs."" ($19) - I finished up my steak and mushrooms, along with my string beans and baked potato. There was nothing special about our meal, it was standard food although a bit expensive. Service was fine, they had a steady stream of customers coming in to dine as well. Apparently, they do have a happy hour so it's better to call ahead to check what times they happen. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Normally, this restaurant has a great reputation. In Florida, it was one of my favorite places. Here in the Southpark location in Charlotte, it is actually really bad. The last few times I went, the service was terrible, the hostesses rude, the food was bland and skimpy on portions, and the atmosphere awful. The very last time I went, it was so bad, that I emailed the corporate office to let them know they are being represented poorly here in charlotte, and they sent me a couple of free meal coupons. So, this past weekend, I went there to give them one last try. Upon arrival, I noticed quite a few tables out on their patio, and the day was glorious...74 and totally sunny. Once inside at the hostess stand, I requested a table on the patio. She told me they had ""stopped seating outside"", and it was 1:00pm?? I then said, well I guess we have to sit inside, which she then told me there was a 15-20 minute wait. When I questioned all of this (since there were no people waiting, and the dining room was practically empty, she said they were short-staffed. Wow! Talk about your horrible management! This is so sad. I hate to see a good company go down because of horrible management. Needless to say, I did not stay to eat, and will never return to this location again. I do wish there was another Charlotte location in the Ballantyne area that had a different manager so they could be as wonderful as they are in other states. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This was our third stay at the Golden Nugget and by far the most disappointing. We got married at the GN in 2009, spent our 1st anniversary there and thought it was time for another visit. We booked a package deal for 4 nights. On the 2nd morning my husband ran into housekeeping in the hall and they said they had us on their list as checking out that day. Since our reservation was for another 2 nights we went right down to the front desk with our vacation reservation confirmation e-mail. There, they were very unhelpful and accused our vacation company of sending them the reservation incorrectly. The Golden Nugget said they could extend our stay at the regular nightly rate for our last 2 nights. Obviously since we prepaid for a vacation package we weren't going to pay for the rooms again. They said we needed to call our vacation company to figure it out with them. So, we called the vacation company and they said they needed to get in touch with the Golden Nugget - I stayed on hold while they did this. The woman kept coming back on the line to say that no one was answering at the Golden Nugget. FINALLY 1/2 hour later, someone answered and they got it straightened out. The Golden Nugget admitted it was a clerical error on their end. So, we went back up to the front desk. The clerk at the counter offered no apology and said our reservation had been fixed. I asked to speak with a manager as I was unhappy we wasted an hour of our morning on their mistake (not to mention, had housekeeping not told my husband they had us down as checking out that day we would have never known! We were going to the strip that day, so would our stuff have been gone when we got back that night??). Again, no apology until I expressed how disappointed we were in the service we were receiving regarding their mistake and I asked for some type of compensation - a room upgrade or something. He offered us 2 buffet lunch coupons, which we were not interested in (no plans to eat lunch at the hotel the next 2 days) and then he told us that was all he could do and our reservation was fixed, so everything was fine now. Maybe everything was fine on their end, but we left the desk extremely upset at their lack of empathy, inability to own up to their mistake and poor customer service skills. At the end of our trip when we were actually checking out we were told there was a charge to our room for 2 nights at full price!! They did fix this right away, but it was just one more example of their incompetence. Other Cons: You have to pay for WiFi, but if you go down the street to the Plaza it's free and there are tons of places on the strip where it's free. Rooms in the Carson Tower are dated and falling apart. I understand it's the oldest tower, but some updates/upkeep would be nice. Positives: the pool, the super comfortable bed and the fact that it's downtown This was definitely our last stay at the Golden Nugget which makes me sad because it is where we got married. We experienced such fabulous customer service elsewhere during our visit that I couldn't imagine putting up with the less than mediocre service from the Golden Nugget again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Completely overrated, overcrowded, and underdelivered. Yes, it's a decent burger. A little better than McDonald's, not as good as Carl's Jr., but perplexingly an EVENT to attend. The menu boasts three versions of the same burger, and if you snoop around online, you'll soon discover that a whole secret society of (gasp) OTHER WAYS to order those burgers in code exists. So you go up there armed with your fancy shibboleth and get it ANIMAL STYLE. Super-awesome, I'm sure, because that means extra sauce and also pre-mixed with mustard. You know, like animals make burgers. OK, again, these are good fast food burgers, and the price is appropriate (which is certainly welcome), but seriously... come on.... you know this was a total waste to come here, right? Next you'll tell me you simply HAVE to go to White Castle. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My wife and I decided to try Red Lobster again after the horrible service we had about two months ago. It was a Tuesday night so no one was waiting to be seated but there was no hostess when we walked in. After five minutes, she walked out of the bathroom with another person (waitress) and then we were seated. In being seated in a direct line of sight to the hostess, she had to be in the bathroom at least six or seven more times and anyone coming in to eat had the same issue we did. We finally received our water after 10 minutes of waiting and then another 10 before our order was taken. If it was busy, sure but it was not at all. Biscuits - undercooked. Breaded shrimp - undercooked. Waited 10 minutes after my meal finally arrived to get a baked potato. Chicken - no flavor and tasted like it just came out of the microwave. Two times in a row. We will never eat there again. The manager was too busy watching baseball to even notice what was going on, or just did not care. One star for a nice waitress. ",1,0,0,0,0

 It means more to me than anything to see a Japanese person succeed in America. It's very difficult to run a small business. The hardships you must endure to barely allow your business to just merely survive one more month are indescribable. I'm not going to make this a detailed argument about politics, but whenever a democrat is in office, small business(most particularly Asian owned business) will struggle. There is a misconception that if you own a business that you are ""rich"". In reality the owners of these establishments put their life savings on the line to buy these small stores. They cannot afford to hire workers, or pay workers comp insurance, etc. Everyone in the family works over 12 hours a day to barely allow the business to break even. As a 4th generation Asian-American, no one supports small business more than I do. I would prefer to shop here any day over mega Asian markets such as Greenland, 168, and Seafood City. Mini Mart Japan is a great resource here in LV. They have just about everything you need when it comes to making basic Japanese food at home. They have a great selection of Japanese candies, and candy from other Asian countries that are popular in Japan. Also, they have DVDs of current television shows in Japan that are impossible to find online. I come here for that Special Instant Ramen that tastes almost like what you find at your favorite Ramen-Ya. Also, I like to stock up on Green Tea and Mochi Kit Kats!! Japanese products have a very quick expiration date. For example, we can buy Kit Kats at any convenient store or Wal-Mart, but when you open the package the Kit Kat will taste hard, stale, and have that white chalky stuff all over it. A Kit Kat from Japan will never be like that. It will be moist, fresh, and full of flavor. It features no chemical preservatives, but may have a shorter self life. That's why you will have to pay extra, but to me it is far worth the extra dollar. I know that many of you FOB Asians and 2nd generation Asian-Americans don't understand my point of view when it comes to supporting other Asians in America. I read your Yelp reviews and see how you bash other Asian owned businesses and give harsh bullying reviews. In the last decade, I've seen the Asian community in America become very disconnected and spiteful of each other. Everyone wants to be ""white"" now, and no one supports each other. Asian-Americans are indeed the highest economic earning group in America. No other race makes more money than us according to ALL studies. Do you know how we got to that place? Because a long time ago we used to support each other, and help each other succeed. So, let's keep it that way. Let's remain on top of the food chain here in America. Instead of condemning businesses like this for being ""too small"" and ""not fancy"", lets band together again like old times. I encourage all Japanese-Americans in LV to support businesses like JAPAN MINI MART, and other small business in LV. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Ordered the 8 piece meal in original recipe via the drive thru window. The lady at the window, Alma, was courteous and friendly. Unfortunately, that's where the good part of this visit ends.When I got the food home, the chicken was anything but the ""KFC Original Recipe"". The chicken was overcooked and dried out. I think the chicken had been sitting around for awhile at this KFC location and they may have even reheated it in a microwave. I gave some of the chicken to my two dogs. I'll give the rest of it to them for their meal today. At least somebody enjoyed the chicken. I stopped going to this Sun Lakes location because they actually ran out of cooked chicken a time or two in the past. So now you have the opposite situation: overcooked chicken that is allowed to sit around and then reheated. I usually go to the KFC on Chandler Blvd in Chandler AZ. I went to the Sun Lakes location because it was a convenient stop for me on the way home. The next time, I will drive the extra miles and go to the Chandler KFC location. They at least know how to cook chicken. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We got a bungalow queen suite. I was really excited because we got a suite. I have stayed at Paris, Venetian, and Ballys' in a regular room. I thought since we had the suite it would be bigger. When i arrived at teh hotel........ WTF!!! The room looks like a regular room in paris. I should of got a room at Paris for cheaper. hahahah. Only one bathroom. It said separate bath and shower so i'm thinking there should be two separate bathroom. Nope!!! I was not happy. Their was no separate entertainment room. The beds were in one big opening. So small we didn't have much room. We had 6 girls in one room. WHATEVER!!! Misleading website. I had better experience than this. Too bad i didn't have a picture of the room. hahaha. i'll show you guys what i mean.......... ",0,0,1,0,0

 ***Montreal Burger Week*** Since it was my last night off of the week I decided to take advantage and get at least one contender for the Montreal Burger Week under my belt so that I wouldn't have missed the whole thing like last year. Newtown was near to my destination and I had about an hour to kill so when I saw the instagrammed photo I just had to try it. Burger, toasted bun, cheddar cheese, fried egg, onions, chipotle mayo, and a nice big patty. Not just any patty, a patty that consisted of pulled pork surrounded by angus beef and then wrapped in bacon. Gluttony for punishment? Don't mind if I do! I'm glad I took a salad as my side or else I probably would have gotten heart palpitations, but it also gave the kitchen a chance to let me taste their wonderfully balanced yet tangy salad dressing. Yum. The only thing I would have added would have been to top it with quick-fried onions or caramelized onions instead but even with the regular onions the burger was top notch. so... full... but... want... another...

 I'm only giving This review a one star because It wouldn't let me give anything less So where do I begin? I went Memorial Day weekend for a music festival and my anniversary this year. Already booked this room way in advanced for a way cheaper price and I shown up to pay triple the price. Because there was a music festival that caters to punk rock or alternative crowd, we and anybody that was hotel guests were marginalized to where wrist bands FOR THIS WEEKEND ONLY. Not that bad you say? Well this ensures that you can't bring ANYBODY to the room with you and if you do want to, then you have to pay $25 a wrist band just to visit. YOU CANT EVEN VISIT OTHER HOTEL GUESTS IN ANY OTHER ROOM! that's right. My friend in the floor above me can't visit me. They also had this card system to operate the elevators. In which you are subjective to the floor that your staying on. For the room itself; it wasn't bad until I tried to flip some switches. Some of the electrical didn't work. Not that big of a deal. Looked in the bathroom to find a wet towel on the tub floor. And on the sink counter, I find CRUSTY, DIRTY PANTIES! No joke! I raised hell and all they gave us was $15 food credit in which it didn't work. I keep getting harassed about the wrist bands which fall off in the shower and tried to get me to pay an additional $25 to buy a new one when they had my name was filed as a guest. I've payed $400 to be marginalized, with horrible service and didn't even care when I talked to the hotel management with no sort of compensation. This is the worst establishment that I have ever stayed at with no regard for customer service. I've felt like I was forced to wear flair and we know what party made people wear flair. I'm never staying here again and I urge anybody that is planning to stay here, gamble, eat here ect. To find somewhere else. I know about 2 dozen people that could vouch this review and had similar experiences. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The food was good but the waitress was passive aggressive and condescending. The wine was corked but we did not mention because we were getting dirty looks for asking questions. She was annoyed by every question and did not explain the specials to half of our group that arrived two minutes later than the first group and treated them like idiots when they asked questions. The disdain and eye rolling reminded us of our worst experience in Paris. We've never submitted a bad review before. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is a great bar to drink at, and all that. But, unfortunately customer service matters. 10 days ago the ATM stole $100 from me. It debited my account twice for the $100 but never dispensed my money. 1 transaction was automatically reversed, the second wasn't. The next day I called the number on the front of the ATM and was informed they no longer process the transactions. FOR 10 days I have been leaving messages (5 total) for the manager Scott, with not one call back. Twice in person and 3 times on the phone, I have explained that I am just trying to find out who owns the machine and I can take it up with them. After 10 days with no phone call back, it is obvious this establishment does not care about its customers, only the bottom line at the end of the night. I will be taking my business to the other fantastic bars in the neighborhood from now on, including Soul, Jackalope Jacks, and Whiskey Warehouse. Customer beware, pay with cash and don't use the ATM.

 It's been a minute since I lived in Pittsburgh, but I frequently return to attend events and visit close friends from school and work. I think Pittsburgh has absolutely wonderful food, and I truly became entranced with the culinary scene while attending Carnegie Mellon and checking out local fare. Luckily for us CMU kids, Shadyside was a hop, skip, and a jump away. Therefore, it was naturally the perfect neighborhood to dine and shop. I had the opportunity to attend two group birthday dinners at Girasole. Both times the food was authentic. The place itself is very small and intimate, so it has a very nice, cozy, if not bordering on claustrophobic feel. That is not the impetus for my review. Both times I have dined here, the customer service was intolerable. A moment that I will never forget in all my life was at my birthday dinner, when the waitress came to our table as we were about to leave, and said to our group, (my friends who had graciously paid for my dinner) ""why is the tip so low? What was wrong with my service?"" My friends had left this woman at least a 15% tip. I will never forget this publicly humiliating moment for the rest of my life. This should serve as a reminder and a stark warning for all who work in customer service (as I have myself) that you should never, ever do something as atrocious as what this waitress did. There were so many alternatives to how she or the restaurant itself could have approached this, but I truly believe she acted in the least responsible, most alarming manner I have yet to see from anyone who holds a job. That is the prime reason why I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. ",1,0,0,0,0

 3.5 stars This is a lovely hotel. I was here with my best friend riding on her tab. That being said I do not think I would ever stay here unless that were the case. Someone else chose it and was likely paying for it. I dunno, It needs something. Like WiFi, cable or a stereo in the room. It was always so so so quiet in the room. They charge to listen to music on the t.v. or watch the t.v. and ten dollars for two hours is too much for t.v. music if you ask me. I found the decor to be bland as well. It kind of felt like I was at my Mom's apartment were she more conservative. The bathroom is freaking rad though. A separate room for the toilet. A stand up all glass shower with body jets as well as a separate tub that two people can easily fit in. A vanity complete with stand up cosmetic mirror with built in light. Two sinks and lots of marble. Bathroom was pretty gangster. I liked how spacious the rest of the hotel was but decor was boring and the beds could be more comfy for how much the hotel costs. I give the Venetian an additional star for stellar customer service. Housekeeping was fantastic as well as room service. Every morning they would come in and line up our shoes, straighten our toiletries and just generally make us feel very looked after. The hot tub was too chlorinated for me to spend much time in but the pools were very pretty. Many of the hotels in Vegas pump some kind of scented deodorizer through the buildings. Likely to mask cigarette smoke. The Venetians was actually the worst I smelled though. So strong. 20 minutes in the lobby would be enough to give me a headache. I joked that the front fountain was full of febreeze not water. ",0,0,1,0,0

 What a terrible experience. Today was my first time eating at Boka Pizza as this is my first day working downtown. Darius took my order and was nice and inviting being a first time customer. When I opened my order once I got back to work I realized it was all wrong. I ordered the cheese steak and asked for no mushrooms on it. It was mainly loaded with veggies with a lot of mushrooms. I figured well at least I have onion ring I get to enjoy only to find out that they gave me fries which were mostly soggy and uncooked. I also got to the bottom of my root beer to find little hard black plastic like specks. I only noticed them after feeling them in my mouth and in my throat. I have no idea what they were and I generally would not gripe so much but the fact I paid $15.19 for a drink half sandwich and onions rings is outrageously stupid. Needless to say I will never go back there nor will I ever promote this place of business since they cannot read a receipt, listen to customers and have no level of cleanliness with the crap I found down in my drink. I think I will also be giving the health dept. a call since I don't know what I ingested. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I love wood fire & brick oven pizza. So, found this tiny (and mean TINY) restaurant by accident after ditching Jack N the Box. Its tucked behind fast food, big name franchises on the North/East corner of Scottsdale & Shea and is a nice little gem. Besides how small the place is, the first thing you notice is the menu is very small (dinner menu is a little bigger), so me and my friend picked different things and shared. We got a personal pizza and a meatball sandwich. The sandwich was good, but not spectacular, but the pizza is awesome! I went back again for dinner and again the pizza was terrific, as was the salad; delicious. We asked them to do a half and half and they said no problem which is great; I hate when places won't compromise for make you feel guilty for changing their stuff. I loved it and my girlfriend loved it. Also something fun is their soda is not fountain drinks, but bottled real-sugar cane sodas that are delicious. The only strange thing I have to say is the owner doubles as the server and he is very chatty. That's not a bad thing; he is a very nice guy but be prepared to have a conversation with the guy. Recommend for a casual lunch and dinner for gourmet pizza & salad. Pros: Amazing pizza, great food, great service and inviting setting. Cons: Very small menu; caters more toward veggie eaters rather than meaty pizzas. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Yelp I'm sorry but you let me down! I don't get how this place has so many good reviews. First the tables block the entrance so you can barely enter the place. Signage is very bad and you can't even see it. The place is beyond gaudy and looks like something from my grandmas living room. The portions are HUGE and the prices are cheap but the food quality was lacking! The sweet and sour ribs weren't even ribs, it was pork butt! The Korean chicken was tender but I didn't care for the skin that was left on it. The place is very old school which may work for some older people but not for me. There's other places that have the same style food and I'll be sure to check them out before ever stepping back into this flashback from the 70's. So please say aloha....

 Going to keep it simple. Pro's Atmosphere- very good job. TV's everywhere. Service-friendly-pretty ladies Beer is definitely cold! Menu is limited. We ordered a variety of stuff that came out ok(bar food).Portions, price ok . We had sandwiches which were fine and a Cobb Salad. Con's For lasting power in an area with lots of bars and competition they need to cater to the locals- - No Happy Hour - limited menu - No advertised food or drink specials -Not open 24hrs - Pricey for drinks -UFC $10 per person- but they carry it. -limited wine menu-really not much at all and horrible selection. -No pitchers of beer or bottles of wine for purchase. -Football season will be interesting because all other places offer specials during the games. The splash is now since its new however, I'm confident someone will consider a few of the above. With that said it's worthy of a visit. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The worst Pizza Hut we have ever been to, with the worst service. I came in to order a pizza and the person didn't seem to understand the order but said it will be ready in a little bit. I LITERALLY waited about half an hour for the pizza to be ready before they came out with the completely wrong order giving me a completely different pizza. It turns out that the person didn't even take the order right. They didn't really seem to care and made me order all over again even attempting to charge me again. After I re-ordered, again I waited about another half an hour with a different employee coming to ask us what pizza we ordered again and again. Throughout the almost 30 minutes we waited for our re-ordered pizza, all we saw were employees in the back playing around and not giving a care that they got our order wrong and made us wait so long. There was literally nobody in front checking up on us while we waited for our re-ordered pizza and instead kept asking us which one we ordered. They didn't even apologize for getting our order wrong or making us wait almost an hour at ALL throughout the whole time. A very poorly run Pizza Hut with absolute horrible service. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This is by far the nicest spa I've ever frequented. I got a Spafinder deal for a $99 facial (Mon.-Thurs.). Not sure I would be as effusive about this place if I had paid regular price ($180) for my facial, but anyway . . . . The locker room was impeccably clean--a must for me! The vanity area had plenty of supplies--hairbrushes, cotton swabs, razors, toothbrushes and toothpaste. I enjoyed the fitness center, which was enormous and empty. Each bike/elliptical/treadmill has its own TV screen, which is a nice touch. They provide bottled water, towels, and headphones. After the workout, I enjoyed the Roman bath (a large jacuzzi), the artic room (it snows when you wallk in!), the dry sauna (nice temperature), adn the steam room (ditto). You are supposed to wait in the Tea Room for your treatment. They provide plenty of magazines, fruit juice, and snacks (pretzels, bananas) to make the wait as painless as possible. To enhance the relaxing vibe, the Tea Room is the only place in the spa with a clock. The staff offers to take your order from a menu of about 8 loose leaf teas. One final caveat: On the weekends, in addition to being more expensive, I suspect that Qua is more crowded and thus may not be the tranquil retreat it was when I visited. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Tonight I went here for dinner on a date. The restaurant was relatively empty - Sunday night at 6. I ordered the mushroom ravioli that was very undercooked. The sauce was fine. I told the waitress about the undercooked ravioli and she thanked me for letting her know. There was no offer to make it right. She just cleared the plate and offered the dessert menu. Her lack of concern was surprising. This was not my first disappointing experience at this restaurant at this location. I'd steer clear in the future. ",1,0,0,0,0

 From a Top Chef Master, I expect much more. This was a horrible experience as we came here for Restaurant Week. We got off to a dreaded start where it took almost half an hour to get our wine out. The only good thing RM did well was ship out some of the best Mattaki (BC), Potters Moon (RI), and Blupoint (NY) oysters. This would have been perfect if you brought the wine before we could enjoy these oysters. We continued to sit for a good 15 minutes before they could locate the bottle of Bordeaux. The clam chowder was pretty flat. I honestly enjoyed the clam chowder from the M Resort buffet. You'd expect much more from a world class Top Chef master, right? Next, we had the diver scallops with black bean sauce. The scallops were nothing special and lacked seasoning. All of the food came out rushed since they did not time the delivery with the delayed wine. Last, our waiter even knew he did a shitty job. He comp'ed us 2 coffees and 2 additional glasses of wine, but honestly they could have done more since everything they did was wrong. If you're going to experience fine dining on the strip, do not go here. I take some responsibility for bypassing the 3-3.5 star rating I saw. I was just hoping these Yelp reviewers were harsh but they were overly generous with their ratings. Do not come here. I wasted my money and could have had my last Restaurant Week experience anywhere else. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I went to see Cynthia S. Payne to get a renewal on my contact lens prescription. My regular optometrist moved her office to Henderson so I thought it would not be a big deal to go somewhere closer to get my annual prescription. I explained very clearly at the beginning that I was NOT interested in LASIK and was simply there for an eye exam to get a renewed prescription. From the time I walked in, until the time I left, the entire staff did their part to try to and sell me the LASIK procedure. They had me do an unnecessary test which later I learned was used to determine if I would be a good candidate for LASIK. Finally after my exam was completed, they had me sit with a LASIK consultant/coordinator to go over prices for LASIK! Cynthia Payne did an adequate job on my exam, but I don't appreciate the sales pitch, unnessary test, and the waste of my time for their own agenda. I was there much longer then necessary due to all of the sales pitch nonsense. I will not return. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Avoid this place. BY FAR THE WORST GENTLEMAN'S CLUB I'VE BEEN TO IN VEGAS! Wife and I went to Vegas a few weeks ago and usually we visit one of the Gentlemen's clubs we know we enjoy. The Cab driver insisted on Sapphires claiming it was the ""Worlds biggest with plenty of seating"". We figured sure why not. Some clubs in Vegas its hard to find seating, so when he mentioned the place was huge and seating was not a problem we figured it was worth a shot to try a new place. BIG MISTAKE. After paying the $40 cover to get inside we're greeted by a gentleman with two dancers next to him almost like they're next in line for the next group that walks in the door. Seemed awkward to us. Both girls, pretty in their own regard, were not our type and I was hoping he wasn't going to try and throw them at us. As we approached him, he asked us how many were in our party, and I told him 4. He gave us one look and said go ahead and walk in with no other information. As we walk down to a large room full of tons of empty chairs we notice EVERY SINGLE TABLE has the word ""Reserved"" on it. We see there is a second room that is completely empty with the same signs. We look over to the bar and notice its shoulder to shoulder packed. My initial guess is that they don't allow you to sit down in this place unless you pay additional money to sit in one of their ""Reserved"" seats, but we were not quite sure yet. Anyways, we walk up to the extremely crowded bar area and order 4 drinks. Like others have stated its about $14-$16 a drink. I saw a girl ask for some water and they gave her the tiniest bottle and it was $10. She almost flipped her lid. The bar was a mad house every one was just there standing staring at the dancers on stage. Also since the bar is perched up they could see all the ""Reserved"" tables with the patrons getting lap dances. The over crowding of the Bar became to much so my wife went back to the gentleman who told us to just walk in and ask him about all the reserved tables. When she asked what the story was with those he said ""Go get your entire group and we can talk about pricing"". My wife again asked if he can simply explain how this all works and rudely the douche replies ""Go get your group and we can talk about pricing"". Needless to say we were done. So let me get this straight, we pay $40 to get in, then before taking 5 steps in to the place we were to be confronted to pay additional money to sit? If not our only option is to be shoulder to shoulder with everyone at the bar. And should we choose to pay for one of your ""Reserved"" seats, we get the pleasure of everyone at the bar gawking at us while we enjoy our personal dance? This place is a joke. This is one of the first times I have hated my experience at a gentleman's club in Vegas. The other couple we brought it was their first time at a gentleman's club so he had to apologize on behalf of Sapphire's and tell them this is not how normal clubs function. If anything they've just experienced the worst of the worst. We ended up going to one of our favorite clubs and spent a lot of money and enjoyed ourselves. Unlike Sapphires, we spent it willingly and not forcefully. Please don't make the same mistake we did, there are plenty of other clubs that are a thousand times better than this god awful establishment. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Thanks again, Rachael Ray, for another great spot! We went to the Peppermill twice on this visit and twice on the last for breakfast. The Joe's special is good, but the Munch's breakfast is better. It is hash browns, cheese, mushrooms and other stuff topped with three eggs. I chose over easy 'cause I like the runny goodness of the yolk all over my hash browns. We got a mediterranean omlette which is huge, 10 eggs I think, and pretty good. Also their biscuits and gravy are the bomb. Make sure you share, their portions are huge. Also, their bloody marys are one of the best I have had. A cocktail waitress in a long black gown comes to serve you your drink! The place is really neat, kind of out of the 60's/70's or something with a Florida feel (they have flamingo stained glass hanging lamps). Everything is plush done in purple, teal, and blue, with fake plants and trees, and neon and mirrors abound. sounds gaudy, but it is actually a nice place, because it is so unique. and the great food. The lounge is neat, with a water pit with fire in the middle. would like to pop in here one late nite. Will definitely frequent this place again! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Would not recommend this nanny service for several reasons: 1) Phone Tag It's hard to get a hold of a real person when calling. I left several messages and no one called me back. Not fun playing phone tag all day. 2) Got Babysitters rather than nannies We had a babysitter that said ""I've been doing this off and on for a few months. I quit working for a few months and then work for her again. Working to save money for the wedding."" This showed in the way that my 15 month old son was crying, still up at 10 pm, not dressed in his pajamas, and still hungry when we got back from a wonderful Cirque du Soleil show. 3) Didn't get money's worth Felt very disappointed at spending $200 for 4 hours of babysitting especially since the website looked very promising with the positive reviews. Highly recommend Nannies and Housekeepers that the Wynn Hotel Concierge set up for us. --------------------------- Looks like it took about 1 1/2 years to get a response from the owner....

 Items selected: Red Velvet Cupcake Carrot Cake Cupcake Tres Leches Cup Pistachio Macaron Salted Caramel Macaron Speculoos Macaron Boston Cream Pie ...if it had not been so good I'd blame a friend for pointing out that Drago Sisters is right down the street from Sugar Bees, but in retrospect I guess I owe her thanks for adding to a truly ""sweet"" Saturday when seven items from the small bakery found their way back to my home as an extension of breakfast...or a midday snack...or ""3rd meal""...out of six. A somewhat eclectic place with nuances ranging from classic French to Modern American and even Hispanic dotting an otherwise Italian collection of pastries it was with much indecision that I stood pondering the selections but eventually succumbing to a combination of personal tastes and staff suggestions everything that followed was artisan craft at its best; cakes dense yet supple, frosting sweet but light, macarons a crisp break with natural, smooth filling followed by an ethereal linger, and two items warranting ""destination"" status; first a Boston Cream Pie superior to the original in texture, cream, as well as cocoa and the second a small cup (available in sizes up to a full celebratory cake) filled with a baba style sponge oversaturated in sweet, milky tones and topped with piped pastry cream plus dark chocolate chips... ...oh, and on a completely unrelated note, my birthday is in March.

 The location in Hollywood, Fl is absolutely amazing, this location however was very disappointing. I made such a fuss about this restaurant to my husband that we made it a point to go to the Rio so he can taste the great food for himself. Well, after trying to get ahold of someone all day to make reservations, we decided to make the trip anyways. When we got there at 5:30PM they stated it was overbooked. We had to sit at the bar where the Bartender rushed us in and rushed us out. She literally gave someone our seat while we were still sitting there. We had appetizers which the bartender served our plates between my husband and I... WTH what if I wanted more meatballs than him? Leave the plate there and we'll serve ourselves, thank you very much. Anyways, the food was okay but the portion size was disappointing. As stated above the Hollywood FL location ROCKS! Skip this location at the Rio in Las Vegas. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Made a reservation the night before for a ride to the airport at 6:00AM. I was put on hold/ignored for about 15 minutes talking to dispatch while the cab arrived at 6:33AM, 33 minutes LATE to the reservation.

Keep in mind it was SNOWING and 26 degrees outside. I was late to the airport and subsequently missed my flight due to arriving within the 45 minute ""preboard"". Now I understand that things happen, but call the customer and let them know you will be late and give them a discounted OR a free ride. Terrible service ",1,0,0,0,0

 This review is pretty overdue - time flies eh? But all I can really say is Ick - no. I was in town and staying with my Mom and she was pretty excited to take myself and some other lingering family members here for dinner. Having been a frequent Benihana-er in the past I feel my expectations were pretty high. The service itself was okay - but our cook - he was SO wrong. I'm sure he's just trying to make everyone laugh but he was making sexual noises and ""oh yeah baby's"" while ""beating the meat"" or whatever it was he was making. I was there with my Mom and her husband, but even if it was just friends of mine? Ew...no. So disturbing. Older Asian guy ""making love"" with and to my food does NOT equal appetizing in my world. Not only that - but the fried rice was a disaster. I live for fried rice - and it was almost non edible. Who puts garlic in their fried rice? Well, sure, these guys do. Not just a hint - like a mouthful of ""HEY I JUST ATE LOTS OF GARLIC"" amounts of garlic. I had the Salmon as well - which was tasty overall but it was so over-salted/peppered that I found myself choking on it until I eventually gave up. Sorry to say - none of us will be back here. Not cool guys - just - not cool. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I would give this 3 stars, but I really couldn't get by the ""greasy spoon"" atmosphere of this place. It's not just the decor, the longer I sat here (which was awhile, kind of slow service) the more I saw how much this joint needs to be CLEANED. Went here on a Sunday at opening. One waitress and a groupon special going on which I must've missed out on. She was a little frazzled, and messed up every table's order. We got vegetable curry, vegetable pad thai, and Tom yum soup. The curry was very good, but the rice seemed to have been, ahem, reheated. She brought a different pad thai to the table than what was ordered. The soup was so-so, for the price I wouldn't order it again. Everyone around us was sending food back. As a carry-out this place would probably rate higher. The forks were in a coffee cup on the table, the ""condiments"" had been sitting out all night and everything in this place needs to be wiped down. The kicker came at the end when I asked for a bag for the left overs....the waitress stuck her finger in the pitcher of water at the beverage table to separate the plastic bag from the stack. Carry-out if you eat here ",0,1,0,0,0

 Pawn Stars: The Gift Shop. Heading North towards downtown from The Strip, I noticed the crowd outside before I even realized what this place was. Of course I've seen the show, and even meant to make a visit here if the opportunity presented itself-- and suddenly there it was in all of it's glory: Pawn Stars. This place is a short walk from Fremont Street (or a very LONG walk from The Strip). I took a few photos from the sidewalk in front and got the scoop on seeing the Pawn Stars themselves from one of the security guys outside: basically, you don't. They show up for the filming of the show, and the store is closed to the public until they've finished and gone. Pretty much exactly what I figured; but I didn't waste much time here and the pics I took didn't cost a penny. So three stars for Pawn Stars! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I don't get it. I really don't .... Big portions don't mean it's good food. But, my family, who lives there in Las Vegas tends to think so. I guess if you pour enough shoyu or chili pepper water on something, you can't taste how bland something is. And that's what I thought about the food my family picked up for a small gathering at my mom's house. Chicken katsu, fried noodles and teriyaki. Lots of food - gotta give them that. But it stops there. Katsu was not crispy on the outside or moist on the inside. Damp is the word that comes to mind. Teriyaki was overdone. Looked ok at first glance but at first bite, overcooked. Fried noodles was ok. Frying noodles is hard to mess up, like cooking rice. For my taste though, the noodles could have used a little more salt and or shoyu. To each their own - some may like it because they don't know any better. Others may like it because it's all they can get now. Me, I don't and won't settle because I can and will just fly home if I want to have authentic, Hawaiian BBQ. ",0,1,0,0,0

 $100+ for four guys to each get a burger. All weekend long we planned to get the Daniel Boulud kobe/short rib/truffle burger but we were running out of time and so we settled on the Burger Bar instead. The thing about this place is that even though there are endless ways of customizing your burger (choice of meat / bun / toppings / cheese / sauces), most of the time you just want to choose from a combination of toppings. There are a few combinations but none of them sound very good except for a kobe/truffle burger and a burger with lobster in it. I chose to go custom: ridgefield beef, bleu cheese, bacon, and a black truffle sauce on ciabatta with a side of sweet potato fries. My verdict? Pretty awesome. Total damage? 30something dollars. Not too bad, the price of a buffet and either way I'm stuffed. The other cool thing about this place is it has a very extensive list of beers. They had hitachino beer here but sadly only the lacto and hef here. I don't recommend any of those. The thing that sucks is it is a small place, it gets busy, and theres no place to sit and wait. There's shopping but you know Vegas and seating... only at the tables or in front of the slot machines. It's in a mall. They need beepers so you can venture away without worrying about losing your spot. 3 stars for it was good and I might come here again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 It's hard to be drawn to this place when its in the recently updated market square but don't let the looks fool you, this place is delicious. I tried Primanti the day before and I wish I went to La Gondola first. This place had good pizza and service was decent. This place has been family-owned for over 30 years and its apparent why. I wasn't please with the sausage because it was essentially like in small bits and amounts, but the thin crust was baked just right and the cheese was good as well. There were no napkins and too much grease on the pizza. No bathroom in site either. I wanted to wash my hands. Best food I had in Pittsburgh besides the William Penn Omni Terrace Room.

 The hamachi (yellowtail) we had here was a very generous portion and absolutely perfect. The sushi chef and kitchen staff know what they are doing here. The ambiance/interior design is kind of dated and it's a little weird to have a spot in a bank, but we liked the food (lunch) a lot. The only sort of unpleasant thing was that one of the staff (bartender?) was hanging around before her shift (I'm guessing) and was very unprofessionally spreading her crap out on the bar as she ate her meal, and then was going back and forth behind the counter, while she complained loudly about something personal. It was intrusive. I worked in restaurants throughout my 20s, so I'm not being prissy about this. It's just bad form. Other than that, it was a pretty good experience and I would eat here again.

 I am a vegan and got married in Las Vegas on 5-21-12. I ordered a vegan wedding cake from Chef Mayra and couldn't wait to eat at her restaurant. Now, I wish I had not done either . I paid $420. for the cake and I was promised it would be ""awesome and have fresh flowers on it"" . It was saddly lacking in taste and moistness and amount of filling and it DID NOT have fresh flowers on it!!! Only mediocre ,too small for the cake, icing flowers! Too bad Chef Mayra, that you did not deliver what you promised!! I wanted to create a beautiful wedding , a delicious dinner, and a yummy cake for ourselves and our guests. The wedding and the dinner were a huge success,thankfully but the cake was a flop. It is very sad to me that I did NOT get WHAT I WAS PROMISED!!!!! It was supposed to be a strawberry filling.... it had such a tiny amount of filling you could hardly taste the strawberries or the filling. Eating at the restaurant Pura Vida was not much better. The hard to get to dumpy part of town would have been okay ,had the food been good but here again it was not that good. On a scale of 1-10 .....10 being the best I would give it a 2 at the most!!!!! That is for the restaurant....The cake was not even a 1 . ",1,0,0,0,0

 Blahhhhh. I love the decor and location of the restaurant. Even as a local, who doesn't appreciate a good view of the dancing waters at the Bellagio? Unfortunately Circo, I didn't like the service you provided. I completely understand that Las Vegas is a city full of booze but just because we didn't order endless bottles of wine that profits your restaurant and gives you higher gratuity doesn't mean that you can give us any less service - we are still paying customers. Since our table had six people it was auto gratuity, they really only performed at 10% gratuity level. Although the food was awesome and the portions were rather generous for a restaurant on the strip, people are ultimately paying for the service, not the food. Circo definitely wouldn't be my first choice if I had the opportunity to return ",0,0,1,0,0

Behind the counters, the staff were experts in their fields of merchandise (the jewelry employee is a gemologist who took a lot of time explaining some great facts about diamond cuts and gems to our interested daughter!)

 I'm trying to decide -- when it comes to pizza, am I a crust person or a topping person? If I am the latter, then I would say that the toppings we tried on three different pizzas were all good but could have been more plentiful. We especially liked the artichoke and olive pizza. Whatever exotic cheeses the chefs put on the pizzas are terrific but are just dotted on. I left the restaurant last night feeling crusty, which is to say I love the wood-fired, slightly burned, soft-on-the-inside crust. So much so that I almost finished off the crust left on my carb-watching daughter's plate. We'll see where things fall in the great crust/topping dilemma next time I visit. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Teeming with people most nights, Phoenix Rock Gym offers quite a few walls for all levels of rock climbers... from beginners to seriously hard-core climbers. They're open till 10p.m. weeknights, which is fantastic for those of us who work. Everything can be rented there, from shoes (bring your own socks) to harnesses to even chalk bags (but if you're polite the employees are pretty nice about just throwing in a chalk bag for free). My typical experience: Wandering in with a buddy who has already been forewarned about my lack of ability at rock climbing. Roving from wall to wall, sometimes doing 5.6s to give myself an ego boost, sometimes doing 5.8s to push my body a little further. But about 2 hours later, sated by my exercise for the month. :). Hours later, sprawled on my bed, with at least one arm upon a homemade ice bag set on a chair. And thinking... ""It was so worth it!""

 This was an unexpected surprise! Feeling a hankerin' for a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, I hit the tried and trusted grapevine (or should that be hop vine?) of Twitter and asked Edinburgh folk if there was anywhere near me that sold it in Edinburgh, where I was Fringin' it up big time. I was given the lead that Usher's might, so thanks to the trusty Yelp app (plugplugplug!) off I trotted. It's a wee bit far from my usual haunts, but that's by no means a bad thing - I noticed a few places I'd like to investigate at another point on my way here. Usher's is downstairs, in a basement kinda set up. Despite that, it's bright and friendly and very welcoming. The night I popped in, there was some stand up comedy on on part of the building, so there is entertainment offered as well. The main point of coming here was the beer. And here, dear alcohol seekers, is where Ushers excels. They had Sierra Nevada, not the Pale Ale but the much harder to find Torpedo IPA. Score! Before that though, I had a look at the choice of ales on the blackboard above the bar, as I was looking one of the staff noticed and asked if I wanted to try any of the ales - having not tried the Outaspace Apple Ale from Drygate yet, I opted for a taster of that. Having tasted it, I ordered a pint. Being a bit short on actual cash (cash machine queues during the Fringe are hellish) I asked if I could pay by card, as I was going to get a Torpedo IPA as well later. Your man behind the bar set up a tab so I could get my second drink later and still have it cold and fresh from the fridge - excellent idea and brilliant service! The beers I had were cold, fresh and served in fitting glasses for the surroundings, and the TVs had sports news showing on them, heaven for me. All in all, a place i would heartily recommend for the ale lovers amongst us - a choice of 10 draft ales, well stocked fridges and knowledgeable staff add up to happy times. Cheers! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Sweet Baby Jesus, can't a girl please find decent poutine in Lawrenceville? I thought you'd be my savior Frankuary, instead you've left me totally confused and questioning my faith. Back in the day (college days to be specific) I loved the Frantuary. I am wondering if I was maybe just drunk? These days, I get really irritated when I cannot get a calorie free beverage aside from water in a restaurant. I honestly cannot tolerate drinking plain tap water with food and no, no I do not want your hipster Boylan's, OK?! I get it, you don't want me to die from terrible chemicals or high fructose corn syrup. But a Diet Pepsi MIGHT have made your blasphemous rip on poutine more tolerable. Probably not. Anyway, we ordered 2 plates of Poutine Qu \ u00e9b \ u00e9cois. It was bland and didn't have enough cheese curds. My friend stopped eating his after the curds were gone. Since there were 5 on his place, more than half the fries were left. I ate more of mine because I was hungry, but did not finish my plate (which is basically unheard of, as I am a glutton). Gravy was totally tasteless. No salt and tasted like it was thickened with corn starch. A really, really WEAK dish that needs to be totally reworked or taken off the menu. I don't know, I guess because my previous positive experiences, I would give Frankuary a chance to atone for their transgressions but no any time soon. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Stop what you're doing and get a burger from here. All burgers here are made from wagyu beef. For those who dont know, Wagyu refers to several breeds of cattle bred for intense marbling and producing a high percentage of rich unsaturated fat. Basically this beef is high quality AF. First of all, the restaurant is usually busy. So you may need to wait 10-30 minutes. BUT it's worth the wait. The staff is friendly, cleanliness is spot on, and the ambiance is casual. Enough with the basics, let's talk about the food. I got the Banh mi burger. Under the bun is a patty made of Angus beef, pork and shrimp, topped with a thin slice of grilled pork p \ u00e2t \ u00e9, crisp lettuce and hints of lemongrass, herbs and curry aioli. On the side is are pickled slivers of carrot and daikon radish, with jalapeno slices and a shallow bowl of nuoc mam, a sweet sauce with a marmalade tang and a hint of garlic. The burger was very juicy, and ""fluffy"" if that's even a right term to describe it's texture. Basically the burger is cooked right, not too tough, and very meaty. It tasted really good, perfect for your inner carnivore. The burger is delicious and filling, enough said. The fries are meh. Their tough and barely salted. It's the sauces you get with them that makes them good. A great place to go too. Will be back again. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Went here last night with a few people. Even though the place was mostly empty, we had to wait for a booth. When we were seated, it took around 12 minutes for anyone to see us. I know this because I checked in on FourSquare and got a free salsa and chips deal, so I had to keep my phone open to show my server, and I couldn't help but notice the time. When when we could find our servers, which was hard to do, they were polite and helpful even when fixing an ordering problem. The food was OK, nothing special. I did find the idea of corn in the guacamole a little unusual. I had the burger bites which were tasty enough to take home. My companions had ribs and mozzarella sticks. Main complaints?

What I like, although there's note that they don't guarantee allergy free, when I told my son had nut allergy, they took the time to clean the equipment and accomodate. It took longer for order to be ready, but never had an accident. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I found Lucy in 2009 and loved them. Yes, they are expensive but we'll worth it. The clothes looked good, even after 5 years of use. They just don't show wear. I could wear the clothes to work and look nice. I would wear a top with casual work pants or pants with a work top. It was great. My issue is they keep changing. Over the years the quality has gone down and they don't care. Also, they have gone to all serious active wear. The last few purchases I have made, the clothes have not even lasted through 3 washings. The tops are all out of shape and full of pills. I don't even want to wear them around the house. I noticed that the manufacturing has moved, the first clothes I purchased were made in USA, then Vietnam, now China. The prices have not decreased, just the quality. Even the headbands are lower quality. I am very disappointed and wish they would go back to what they did best. Great lasting, great looking casual workout clothes. ",1,0,0,0,0

 What I had: La Tomatta Summary: Food-excellent Service-good Ambience and decor-good Went there for breakfast. Were seated right away. The waiter was polite and helpful. We ordered our food it came out rather quickly and was delicious. Their house potatoes were flavorful and done perfectly. The servers were very helpful and polite. My only complaint with them was that they seemed to be arguing about tips and that threw me off a little, I was in a bad mood so that could be it too. Overall for sure will go back. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I can only review the service since I lasted about 10 minutes here. I came in during a soccer game and looks like the restaurant was celebrating with their staff. Or at least that's what we figured out while waiting to be acknowledged. When we first walked in it took a minute for the hostess to come and greet us. We thought we had wandered into a private party at first. The hostess allowed us to choose our table, dropped off the menus and then walked over to a nearby couch, sat down and started eating and talking to a friend. We waited nearly 10 minutes without anyone coming up to us. All we wanted were beers and an appetizer so I got up to order from the bar. I waited there without even an acknowledgement glance from the bartender. I gave up there, walked back to the table and my sister informed me they came and took the food order. By then, I was tired of waiting so we got up and left. And honestly, if the hostess had just explained that they were hosting a get together for the staff and it would be a few minutes before someone came to us, that would have been no problem at all. But because nothing was communicated, it left us confused and a little impatient with them. Will not return. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I thought I finally had found a decent Mexican restaurant in my new neighborhood but this place is seriously bland and makes me miss Mexican food in the mission.

 Love that they have a gluten free menu. The gluten free pasta was so good I asked to confirm that it was gluten free. My husband had the lobster ravioli, he said it was pretty good, but he would try something different next time. The very best part was the dessert Tartuffo gelato. AMAZING! Really you've got to try the dessert if nothing else. It's gluten free although not listed on the gluten free menu. The location isn't great, the prices are high for what you get, but it's on the strip and has a gluten free menu so when that's where we're at it's nice to have a yummy choice with an amazing dessert.

 Do you like loud bad music that hurts your ears & gives you a migraine? Do you like being cussed at and called names? Do you like being sexually harassed and stripped of your under garments? Do you like sweating balls all night? Then this is the bar for you!!!!!! I had never been here before but I honestly wish I had kept it that way. I had such a horrible time! When we walked in I noticed how loud the music was and not only was it loud the sound system was of bad quality. I was literally having to scream to converse with my friends. It was extremely hot it felt like there was not any air or AC circulating in the place so I was sweating like I had just ran a marathon. When I got home I literally pealed my clothes off!!!! We start ordering drinks and were just chillin and conversing still sipping on the first set of drinks we had ordered, then rudely one of the bartenders yells to one of my male friends hey cheapo you gonna buy another drink anytime soon or just stand there and stare! OMG WTF how rude we were not even finished with our 1st set of drinks! So I decide to do some shots with my friends and make the most of the night. Every time I would walk to the bar the female bartenders were harassing me to come on the bar and dance with them. After 4 or 5 shots I told them I might consider getting up there, well they took that literally and after about my 4th shot they were pulling me up there forcing me to dance! I was too embarrassed not to dance after already being pulled up so I was like what the hell! So I started dancing and this bartender who I am dancing with on the bar comes up and starts rubbing on my tatas. Then attempts to pull my bra off! I was like oh hell no, but there was no telling her no she was so forceful and had I fought it, I would have had some ripped flesh!!! She then threw it up with the rest of the bras they had stolen from other women! I was so pissed at this point I got off the bar and ran to the bathroom and got myself together. I was not even wearing a top that was appropriate without a bra so I go back to the bar and ask for it back they rudely said nope not gonna happen! I spent the rest of the night braless and feeling like I was just sexually harassed! I understand that may be the bar Motto is to confiscate the bra of a woman who is coarse to get on stage and dance. However there is a difference between playful gestures and inappropriate disrespect of the human body. The gag was on me, had no clue about the ""bra"" must come off policy upon entering this bar. You could NOT pay me to come back to this place! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Ever since this new crew came in to this shop I have to say not only is service horrendous and extremely slow but the attitude on this one new barista is insane.

 Tried out this 24hr fro yo self serve place since I was staying at the Tropicana. It's a nice dessert addition to this end of the strip and definitely a good (or maybe not so good) thing it never closes. There were about 12 flavors available, mostly sweet, like red velvet, cake batter, vanilla, cookies n cream... The yogurt was hard to serve bc the handles were quite stiff but all in all it was decent, if a little sticky. Not too watery. also had the standard toppings, and it was nice that the fruit was fresh. It was pretty expensive for froyo overall, but compared to the gelato and the rest of the food here, altogether reasonable. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I can't believe this worked! I'm thrilled at how well! We were in Vegas over Memorial Day weekend to get married and had about a dozen guests. I wanted to arrange a fun night out, but keep it affordable. I signed up for Moon at the Palms for the Saturday night with a follow up at a strip club. I got an email right away explaining that women would get into Moon for free and men would have a reduced cover charge. A limo would pick us up and take us to the strip club. I was advised that I would hear from Chris via text on the day of to finalize plans and that if there were any last minute changes due to the holiday weekend, I would be notified. So far, so good. Easy...or too easy? I was a little nervous, especially since twelve people were depending on this for a fun time. Saturday afternoon, I was still apprehensive, so I sent Chris a text to confirm. Also, I wanted to change the strip club to another that had been on the list. He replied immediately and stated that 1) Palms was all set and not only would the women get in for free, but so would the men, and the first 150 women get two free drinks. Score! 2) The change in strip club was all set (how this arranged so quickly, I still don't know!) and I would just need to let him know when and where I wanted the limo to pick us up. For real? This was really easy! Sure enough, we arrived at Moon nice and early (as advised because of the holiday and also to make sure we got our free drinks) - so early, in fact, that Moon wasn't open yet! No problem, though; we were shown to the View lounge and enjoyed cocktails and the view before heading upstairs to Moon. At 11:00 PM, I got a call from the limo driver telling me that he would be outside the Palms at 11:30 as I had requested. Sure enough, he was there on time and took us all over to the strip club I wanted. We tipped generously, of course. I still cannot wrap my brain around how organized and professional Chris and his system work, but I am a total believer! I would recommend this service to anyone looking for a fun and affordable way to enjoy the Vegas nightlife. I look forward to working with Chris again whenever I'm in Vegas! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Unbelievably snotty and rude staff and very slow check out. I made the mistake of visiting the Town Square Abercrombie store and was basically not allowed back into the rear dressing rooms after I went to exchange a few sizes because now they were only letting people use the front dressing rooms by the check out counter. The problem was that several people had been tying up the dressing rooms for over 20 minutes and the staff were either too lazy, apathetic or just plain dumb to realize that this is a major inconvenience. Both myself and a women asked politely for them to reopen the rear dressing rooms and this clerk snarked back in the rudest tone ""You'll just have to wait!"" after which I confronted her and said ""Look, I'm not trying to get you in trouble, but that is really unfair to just blow both of us off like that"" She just sat there folding shirts completely ignoring me! I then said, ""Are you going to say something? or are you just going to ignore me?"" She then said in the snottiest tone ""LOOK, WE JUST WORK HERE!, THAT'S JUST OUR POLICY"" then just blew me off. These stuck up bitches working in these Abercrombie stores are just pathetic. Had I not been leaving for a trip the next day, I would have just thrown the clothes on the floor and walked out. I wish I had, as I spent another 20 minutes waiting in line because the same girl, along with her associate who both looked about 18 years old couldn't figure out how to process a return correctly, so we all stood in line getting more annoyed. The only positive was the 1 male employee (go figure) who gave us a discount for waiting so long. Unfortunately it isn't enough to keep me from writing a bad review of their store. I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN. Edited to add: Just found this article about A&F CEO's comments about only wanting cool people to buy their clothes. http://www.mediabistro.com/prnewser/abercrombie-fitch-apologizes-for-ceos-cool-kid-comments_b65301 I'm really glad I found this.

 Ok let me start this review by saying I used to go to Misty's back in the day. I am happily married now and me and the wife just don't do the bars anymore. BUT on this rare occasion I decided to get a few friends together and go party at Z Girls club. We went a lil early to catch the ""Burlesque"" show. We had been there for about an hour and been drinking BUT because the show was about to start they came around and wanted the $5 dollar cover charge for the show. I was flabbergasted. How tacky is that....I can see charging people just coming in but you went around the whole fucking room to collect money from people that were already there WTF - business must be bad! So we paid because we didn't feel like leaving. Lets just say the show was crappy.....not what I expected and the girls were fat. We half assed watched the show and continued to drink. Music was ok but requests never seemed to get played??? We did drink a lil bit and one of my friends was a bit tipsy OK its a bar people!!! She took her shoes off while we were standing at the table and this bouncer/security geek told her to put her shoes back on. OK they were 5 inch stilettos and when she was shoving her foot in she kinda fell over a lil SO this ass decides to kick her out. OMG are you serious. She already stopped drinking and had a bottle of water in her hand. I had already closed my tab out and we were going to be leaving soon anyway but I couldn't believe he wanted us to go. I dropped way too much money in there for them to give us the boot for something like that. We weren't bothering anybody. I have a feeling they treated us like shit because we don't go there often. You could tell they treated the regulars better than the new faces. I don't know it was just a disappointing night. I have read all the other reviews and I agree with most of them. I know several people wont step foot in there because of the owner. I wish Phoenix would get a decent ""girl"" bar. OH BTW the really pretty bartender quit and the ones left are really old or really fat. I couldn't believe the bartender had this shirt on with her big belly hanging out!!!!

The inattentive waitress also thought she could get away with charging my credit card an extra buck and I had already RELUCTANTLY left 15% !!

 i don't mean to sound like a whinging yank, but these bagels kinda suck. i understand that i am not in new york city so i'll be generous and give them 2 stars since it was nice to find a bagel at all so far from home. if you think i'm being harsh, just imagine you're from here in scotland and you go to america and order some haggis. how many stars do you think it would rate? well enough from me... i'll quote the first to review this place, hillary r.: ""if i had never lived in nyc and eaten bagels daily i wouldnt be so immensely unhappy with the bagels here. actually, even if i had never had a bagel ever, i would still not be impressed with the bagels here. theyre a step up from lenders bagels from the grocery store but a step down from the lowly brueggers bagels. but they do have some pretty tasty sandwich meat/item/condiment ideas. too bad they overcharge the fuck out of any of them."" i'll add that their cream cheese was really not good at all. the best part of this place were the cunningly cute customer drawings of elephants that adorned the walls. it may have been pachyderm paradise but it was far from bagel bliss.

 NOT sure why our job was a complete disaster and haven't heard so many lies from a contractor before....hummmmm. All I need to say is they are NOT LICENSED in the state of Arizona and it is completely against the law to act as General Contractor and take money from people and not have a license. We are out a lot of money and we really don't want this to happen to anyone else. You are much better off finding a legit business that holds a license and is backed by the state. They are currently being investigated by The Registrar of Contractors for not having a license. This is going to be a long process so you might as well find someone else that is LICENSED and LEGAL and then you will be covered as a consumer by the State of Arizona. ",1,0,0,0,0

 So a few months ago I moved to AZ from Los Angeles (korea town to be specific) and have not been able to find a descent little korean restaurant, until now! What make this place even more special is that they are (or the cook is) Koreans that grew up in China and are able to cook both, very well. The place is new, only in business about 5 month. The owner also owns the AYCE sushi bar in front (which is how I found this place). For me, walking into the restaurant was like being home. The first time I went they were about to close but stayed open and make my food. The owner, Sunny, was so sweet and hooked me up with kim chee and a lot of other side dishes. I've been back a few time since and have enjoyed it each time. I'm so happy I found my new little korean spot! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I use to travel a lot. I mean, a lot, lot. During of those travels, I realized that the hotel bed I slept in probably saw a lot of action through the year (except that night I was there). That kind of made me realize, ""Jesus, there's a whole lot of f'ing on this bed (that I'm sleeping in)"". This applied to even the high class hotels (don't think there isn't some freak ass stuff going on with those people). I didn't travel with equipment to detect bodily fluids, but I'm betting there would be a whole lot of traces of it in a hotel room. Thank god I don't travel much now. The reason why I bring this is up is Elara's rooms reminded me of the nastiness of hotel rooms. Having a bathtub in the bedrooms? Might as well put up a mirror on the ceiling and call it the honeymoon suite. I'm betting a lot of 'videos' have been filmed in those rooms. Nice touch with the detaching hose spray in the tub. I've been around the block to know what that was for as well. All this stuff freaks me out when I've got kids wanting to be around that tub. A 1 bdr room is huge. Check out a youtube video if you haven't seen one. Unless you're part of a massive bachelor party, don't stay here. You could tell that dudes were packing in rooms, because the elevators would have large groups of guys coming in and out of them. Not a big deal, but hallways get loud, not to mention yelling/screaming in the middle of the night. Well, next door was a couple who was proving my theory about hotel rooms at about midnight (top of the review). I'm so glad I didn't have to explain to my kids about the noise that lady was making. Verizon wireless coverage sucked on the 30th floor facing the parking structure. Someone else mentioned that. Washer/dryer is a nice to have, but I wasn't planning on doing my laundry there. A lot of TV's. The remote controls and TV functions are slllllllooooooowwwww. The projection TV is sweet, never seen that before in a hotel room. Lots of channels to watch as well. The pull out sofa bed looked like there were blood stains on it. Used 2 bedsheets and it was good to go. I'll probably never stay here again, unless it's with a bachelor party. Lastly, WTF is up with the $15 a day for valet??? I realize there isn't a casino to support the costs, but that's tacky. *UPDATE* Thanks Stephen (or Jake) for following up on my personally opinionated review. I've been a Hilton Diamond member in the past, so I did enjoy staying at Hilton properties. Sounds like you guys have a plan for the property, perhaps Elara will be considered again for my family vacationing needs. With reviews like Judy V (2/8/2013), sounds like the hotel is going to have to figure out how to accomodate different type of guests. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was so excited to try this place out and hyped it up so much I didn't think it could disappoint. I saw this place featured on Man v. Food and on countless billboards around the Strip. This location, inside Imperial Palace, had a huge line and fairly long wait. I was famished and didn't mind the wait as long as the food lived up to all the hype. Before I even looked at the menu, I knew I wanted to order their signature dish...the chicken and waffles. While I waited for my order to arrive, I saw a wide arry of delicious dishes being zipped back and forth in front of our table. All looked craftly plated, with huge heaping portions. I salivated each time my beloved (or so I thought) chicken and waffles would zip in and out of my line of sight. Finally it arrived, moment of truth. I bite into my deep fried chicken breasts and was underwhelmed to say the least. Batter was soggy, not crispy with the resounding crunch I had imagined. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and moved on to the waffles, hoping that Hash House would redeem themselves here. But alas, I was disappointed yet again. The waffles were huge, and filed with bacon which made my eyes grow large with a childlike wonder, yet I lamented again when I found those waffles to be soggy and rather flat in flavor. Needless to say I walked away from this place pretty much disappointed. Will probably not be returning anytime soon...at least not on my own accord. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I really wanted to check this place out but like a lot of things it didn't live up to the hype. The club that it's attached to, Moon, is normally, too crowded and seemed like an afterthought rather than a vision. I don't like it here; however, the view of the strip from the outdoor patio is fantastic. Advice: Here's a tip if you're getting there late; especially on off nights. There will be a point when you'll pay to get into the Playboy Club/Moon and you can get into the Ghost Bar for free and visa versa. ie. Sunday night at 1:30 am you pay 30 bucks to get into the Playboy Club/Moon and show your stamped wrist and they'll let you into the Ghost Bar for free. Well, if you go to the Ghost Bar, same thing, you'll be able to get into the Playboy Club/Moon for free...only you'll pay 20 bucks to get into the Ghost Bar. ",0,1,0,0,0

 lately i've been living a double life. I've been hanging out my friend's pad in south scottsdale with the true intention of actually chilling before an hour's worth at the gym. It's like downtime after work and before gym, and double life? well I don't go home home until after the gym so technically i've been calling my friend's pad my defacto home w/o paying rent but I must digress before I ramble on how I feel about this situation. lol. Anywho I have learned there are advantages of living in south Scottsdale, for one if you live in south scottsdale you have the luxury of being between two commercial powerhouses which are Tempe Marketplace and Scottsdale Fashion Square. You're in close proximity to two nightlife scenes (if you're into that), and that's Mill Ave and Old Town and lastly there's delivery by the name of Little Chicago Pizza. This pizza joint holds its own compared to the other pizza places I have frequented like Joe's and Gus' Pizza in Old Town. So, I recently ordered delivery of which I found they do not deliver south of Curry so Score 1 since my friend lives at Miller and McKellips (the invisible border of Scottsdale/Tempe), menu items are moderately priced and the third best thing about LCP (Little Chicago Pizza) is the food, it's pretty good. So, ordered some cheese fries which were yummy, a six order of honey bbq wings and a 14 inch Hawks (chicken, bacon and bbq sauce) pizza. The bill came out to around $25, had plenty of leftovers and delivery was prompt. So, what am I saying about LCP, if you're looking for delivery and you're in the area, they're worth it and a good alternative if you're expanding your delivery options. =) ",0,0,1,0,0

 I guess i was expecting something a little nicer, it was just really dark..we had a table and the people were really great but the music was boring, all the same just hip hop all the time and sounded all the same, the bass was way too much like painful too much and i have friends who go to clubs like every night who agreed. the back room was pretty chill played some house music, but was really more of a lounging area than a dancing area...

 I think I set my expectations too high...this is an attempt at replicating the chicken from Bonchon and UFC korean fried chicken of LA/New York...but falls short. I'll start with the positive notes, the sweet garlic sauce has a hint of heat and is flavorful. Whether this ""Love Letter's special nutritional sweet and mild sauce"" really uses 20 different vegetables as ingredients is suspect, but I'll believe it just so I can rationalize this fried chicken is somewhat healthy. The skin is extremely crunchy on the outside, but different than the flaky crunchy texture of Southern fried chicken skin. Another note, the menu prices listed in the photos on the yelp page have changed...it's $2 CHEAPER for half/full orders. The negative side of this eating experience comes in that the only piece of chicken in my half order that was not dry was the drumstick, all the other pieces seemed to be white meat chunks (ie a chicken breast cut into 3 pieces) and were EXTREMELY dry. Don't come here expecting Popeye's or KFC sized chicken pieces. Perhaps I am too accustomed to American sized portions and steroid laced chickens...but the 6 pieces of chicken in the half order is probably equal to about a 3 piece meal at an American establishment. With that said...because I am a fried chicken fiend....I will probably visit this place again in a month in hopes that my experience was a fluke and that the chicken will be flavorful, crunchy, and....hopefully moist! Oh and for those wanting a comparison to the fried chicken at Bazic...Bazic wins based on the juiciness of the chicken and the crunchiness of the skin....but I will say the flavor options are more varied at K Jun.

 Panera beckons you from the road with its crazy good broccoli cheddar soup and cinnamon crunch bagels. Separate, of course. Never eat those together. Plus, free wifi, smiley employees and plenty of seating. Oh, and I really dig that the calorie content is listed on the menus now! So, why not four or five stars for this location? The.Parking.Is.Horrendous. It's awful. I've been to this Panera many a time and every single visit I'm dodging cars, honking my horn to avoid someone backing into me or generally just being annoyed that there is very, very limited parking - even if you drive around back. I like you Panera, but it's really tough to continue this relationship if we want to see each other during lunch hours. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Another standard Chinese takeaway. I feel bad for places like Summerhall Kitchen sometimes, they are small, independent, trying to compete with the many, many other takeaways. But at the same time, the greasy, poor quality, probably not remotely Chinese food always gets to me. Summerhall Kitchen offers the usual array of takeaway standards. There is a big menu, but that usually means the ingredients aren't fresh (another staple of a cheap takeaway). They do offer some money saving offers like the student deal for two at \ u00a313.50, and they also offer a 10% student discount. Overall this place isn't that expensive, but at \ u00a34- \ u00a36 for a dish, you could still go elsewhere for far better quality. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We used to go Frank & Fina's when they had a location on Charleston. My wife loved their flan and was having a flan craving the other days, so we decided to venture out to this location. I had the shrimp fina which was quite delicious. My wife ordered the sweet potato enchiladas. That was also pretty good. I was afraid I wouldn't like it 'cause I don't like sweets. However, it was just a very muted sweet. To cap off our dinner we shared the coconut flan. It was quite good, and my wife continues to contend that Frank & Fina's Cocina has the best flan out there.

 Friendly, family owned and operated restaurant. We got a Groupon deal for this restaurant and we were not disappointed. The waiters are very friendly and attentive, and will take the meat back and cook it more if you prefer well done. I like the fact that the owners are actually working - they were seating people, serving drinks and serving the meat, making sure their guests were happy. No, this place is not super fancy, but the food is delicious! Meat is less salty than other Brazilian bbqs I have been to - which is a good thing. The salt is not overpowering and you can actually taste the cuts of meat. The salad bar is small, but has good quality items. I much prefer this friendly atmosphere compared to a chain restaurant.

 This is a review for the Spa. After having been a Gold Member for 8 months and receiving top notch spa treatments (massage) from one excellent masseuse who is no longer employed there, I had two not so good experiences. The last massage left me with a bruise (I am 46 yrs old and in good physical shape) and when I spoke with the manager the response was much less than satisfactory. I elected to discontinue my membership and was told that no refund would be issued for unused treatments that I had already payed for. This is astonishing given the circumstances! I have a bruise and am unhappy with the service and their response was to hang up on me! No apology and no refund... Bad decision. I thought I was going there to feel better.... I will not return to Copperwynd Spa, resort of Restaurant and will not recommend this place to anyone in the future. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Ordered roasted shishito peppers, short ribs, and a chirashi bowl for lunch. The chirashi bowl came with miso soup. The soup was very light and delicious. Love the shishito peppers. It brought back my childhood memories. I've eaten at many Japanese restaurants in the past but this was the first time i have seen it on the menu. The chirashi bowl had a few kinds of fish chunks with some vegetables and it was good. However, the short ribs were dry and had no taste. It was also cold.

 I must say i was hesitant to try out this place after reading all the reviews but since this is the only buffet place in Cesar's and i had dinner voucher for this place i decided to take the risk. During the holidays they had special sea food special going on which include unlimited shrimps and crab legs. The seafood was fresh and delicious and for me that was a deal maker in itself. In general buffet i didn't find much variety. I tried dim sum ( average), fried rice ( average), two kind of sushi (below average), salad bar, baked fish ( average) and 4 different kind of potato( Awesome, off the hook). The dessert bar was another deal maker for me because it consisted of about 20 different kind of desserts. I think for $27 this place is definitely worth it especially if they have seafood platter as well. The server practically ignored our table hence the three stars ",0,0,1,0,0

 Our experience at Thai Basil was sub-par at best. The chicken satay that came with the appetizer sampler was decent, but the rest of the items (fried sweet potato, fried tofu, spring rolls) did not have a crispy enough coating. Perhaps even worse, the coating tasted more like one that belonged on a corn dog than on an Thai morsel. When we had finished our appetizers, the waiter brought out our spicy clear noodle dish, but not our beef red curry. We decided not to wait to start eating and dove into the noodle dish. It tasted like noodles sauteed in hot sauce and...that's it. In my opinion, good noodle dishes have a complexity - for example, a good pad Thai has hints of tamarine, peanut, lime, and fish sauce. This noodle dish had one level to it, and the one level wasn't even that good. About 10 minutes later, the waiter returned with our red curry, started to set it down on the table, and then hurriedly excused himself, going back to the kitchen with the dish. 5 minutes later, he returned with the same dish and apologized, saying that before ""it was too rare."" Well, it was now the opposite of rare - tough and chewy. Additionally, the curry sauce was thin and milky-tasting, not thick and properly balanced between the spice and coconut milk. Oh, and in case it wasn't bad enough already, the rice was chewy and a bit dry as if it had been made the previous day. So that was our experience at Thai Basil. Not great. Not even good. To be fair, the check was very low for such a decent amount of food, but I would have rather spent $20-$30 more and had a good Thai meal at Wild Thaiger or Malee's Bistro. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm a huge fan of Sauce. Every time I come here, I love the food. It's very simple, very causal, and very easy. The service is (most of the time) excellent! There really isn't much server interaction because you order at the counter and they bring you the food, but the counter people always seem to be happy and in a good mood. The food is really good. I usually always order the Caesar salad with a side of mac and cheese. The Caesar salad is really good. Lettuce is always crisp and fresh, and there is a nice balance between lettuce and salad dressing. It's the worst when you order a salad and it ends up swimming in dressing. But not at sauce. It is a nice portion of dressing, which has a really nice flavor. The mac and cheese is my favorite part. It's extremely creamy and not overbearingly cheesy. The pasta is cooked right to al-dente and its never soggy or mushy. The bread is also really good. They have warm mini ciabatta rolls that they serve with butter that are super good as well! The only con is not being able to find seating sometimes. But hey, if that's the worst it is at Sauce, I can definitely deal with that! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was excited to come and see the #ACAs and was told at the beginning of the show that photos could be taken as long as the flash wasn't used. About 10 minutes into the show, a security guard grabs my shoulder to the point that it's extremely sore, and tells me that photography is not welcomed, and he would remove me from the concert if I didn't stop. Don't tell me I can do something if I can't, and certainly don't be so rude and hurtful when telling me. Don't waste your money here. There are other casinos much friendlier.

 Final night in Vegas, my friend took me somewhere on the way from BINGO to the strip. This was the place she chose, as we were NOT going to eat on the Strip another time. We stopped at Crown & Anchor. First of all, let me say that I was impressed with the decor. Being that I have been in London, it was pretty ""accurate"" with the Pub vibe. Service was A BIT SLOW, and they were NOT that busy. However, this seems to be a recurring factor in Vegas. No one seems to move. Maybe it is just that I am from the NYC area and like things promptly. We all ordered salads. The salads, I must say, are pretty dang tasty for rabbit food. I was really impressed with it. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the english dressing was fantabulous. Prices were NOT that bad. I would definitely recommend this place, if you have some time to kill & are NOT in a rush to get in, grab something to eat, and run. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This review is about The Compass, the revolving restaurant located at the top of this hotel. I received a tip about this romantic dinner spot from the front desk of another hotel I stayed at about 10 minutes away. Romantic it was! My husband and I got there just as the sun was setting and it was a fabulous hour rotation. Our waitress Jerry made our evening even better. She was so amazing, that we will for sure be back to stay in this hotel and enjoy another meal here the next time we are in Phoenix. The food is expensive, but worth every succulent bite. My husband got the ribeye and I chose the roasted chicken. Melts in your mouth! A+ experience from top to bottom. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Well. I'm pleasantly surprised. Considering the mix of reviews I've heard from my collegues. The show was really good! :-) Her entrance was super cool, I don't want to give it away, so I'll plead the 5th on that junk. It lagged a tiny bit for a few songs and then she brought out a personable, down to Earth side, which I loved. She walked around in the audience interacting with fans. Brought up a few of them to sing with her ""around the campfire"" & take pictures. She got sexy, she got hip, it really covered a good spectrum of her repertoire. I will say however, she seemed still very fragile and held-back a bit, but everyone who knows her story is compassionate & understanding. Her voice wasn't as strong, but she pulled out an excellent overall show. It seemed like they cranked up the background music to overlay her singing. But I didn't care. I will suggest this, ESPECIALLY if you're a fan, you'll love it!! The only thing that makes me laugh are her ""backup boy dancers"" LMAO!! These gogo dudes literally were plucked out of a gay nightclub. Not that there's ANYTHING wrong with that!!!!!! I personally embrace that, but, they were in cowboy outfits attempting to be macho and manly. Since most of her following are actual REAL cow-folk, I'm sure they would agree with me, it was quite comical. haha! But then again I could be dead wrong on that....just my personal opinion. It was very good, ENJOY :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 Just called at 2:27 am after being locked out of my apartment, because I left my key with a neighbor to look after my dog, while I was in the emergency room. She's currently unreachable. The man who answered the phone was either so out of it, because he was tired, or maybe even drunk, he was incomprehensible on the phone. After finally gaining some composure, he asked, ""Where are you?"" I told him my location, and he replied, ""I'm sorry ma'am, I can't."" I thought this was a 24hour service. This is the closest locksmith to my home. Should I sleep in my car tonight? Maybe beside the pool in one of the chairs until the apartment opens up in the morning, and I can get a key...

 I really like this restaurant - it is cozy, unpretentious and truly has the feel of a European Bistro. I love that it is in Point Breeze. Of course, their most popular dish (and my fave) is the moules frites (mussels and fries with aioli). I love the white wine sauce, so that is what I get, but I hear the other sauce options are good too. I suggest getting the appetizer version and sharing it with a friend. We've had other stuff off the menu and while decent, nothing that I was blown away by! On Sunday, they also do a brunch. It's good. I think that I prefer the Casbah brunch, but the food here is good and you do get a nice deal (with drink). Decent belgian beer list, not up to the Sharpe Edge, but really, how many places could be like the SE? Wine list is just ehh. Overall, a decent place with great moules frites and a fun atmosphere.

 I stopped by BeaverTails on my way lunch today and here are my thoughts. This place must have been a big hit in the past before people realized that deep fried food is bad for you.

I am a fan of sweet foods and had a bite from my friend who ordered cinnamon sugar and this much sugar could probably kill a mid sized horse if its had one of these for a week.

 Appetizer - 2/5 stars. Entr \ u00e9e - 2/5 stars. Dessert - 5/5 stars. Service - 1/5 stars. Long story short - get dessert for takeout here, and then try and get out as fast as you can. Service was absolutely deplorable for a party of four, taking us close to THREE HOURS from sitting down to actually paying for our meals. I might expect that sort of wait if I was in a two- or three-Michelin star restaurant, but to wait that long in a fancy-pants ostentatious chocolate/crepe bar is completely unheard of. The butternut squash soup I had for my appetizer was watery and as a result not very flavorful. I like my broths to be a little bit thicker when it comes to a squash soup, and this was anything but that. The potato-ham-cheese crepe I had for an entree was a very nice portion size (filled the whole plate), but imagine my shock when I saw sliced deli meat ham inside - are you kidding me?! Maybe I've been overly pampered by other creperies where I've had chunks of the savory meat inside, but to have deli meat inside a crepe?! Get the heck out. If I wasn't disappointed enough from the soup, this was most definitely the coup-de-gr \ u00e2ce of the evening. Other than that, the buckwheat crepe itself was crisp and delicious, but the filling continued to do nothing for me the rest of the night. On the only bright side I can find, the dessert was truly spectacular. I had the tiramisu and it was the most coffee-flavored tiramisu I've ever had, smacking you in the face with that rich espresso flavor. Major kudos for an excellent pastry chef, but man oh man, they've got to do something about their savory dishes. For a place as hoity-toity as this, they should certainly be able to do better.

 Dear reader.... Before you decide if this place is great... think about what else you consider great. When you were 17 and you took a date to Olive Garden, okay, you get a pass. BUT, if you ever ever ever went on a date to Outback, or Red Lobster... just stop right now. You will think this place is just amaaaaazing. So come out, enjoy their food and on the way home jump out into traffic. (Please do that behind me, so as not to make me late to work.) Okay, that said... This place struggles from an identity crisis. Rokerij, who are you appealing to? The fools that think that this is a classy joint because their previous best date was to Applebees? OR are you a really good place? This place should not have a $12 chicken sandwich with fries on the same menu as a $43 steak. Choose one direction and stick with it. I called up at 6pm on a Saturday, first available reservation was for 9pm. This is a good sign. I take the reservation and then went for a hair cut at Urban Hair... see my other review, they rule. We get to Rokerij at 830ish. I walk in the door, and apologize to the staff who are clearly at a waiter station. We must have walked in the side door. Whoops! No, thats the front. Wait, what? A friggin computer screen and some silverware, thats the front? No no, it cant be... oh yes. Yes, this is phoenix. Yes, this is the front. Okay, okay... im cool... whatever. We will be downtstairs having a drink. The bar downstairs is okay. Some 50 yr old dude trying to flirt with a 20something girl. Standard. We have martinis. Not bad, the bartender made it okay. Chopin vodka. He didnt really know what to do with the vermouth, but it was okay. I chat with my friend, we are sitting on a couch, its pretty fun so far. A server comes down and says, ""your table is ready"" Cool. We stand up. She goes over and starts talking to the 50yr old male cougar and his little cub. We wait.... finally i walk over to her. AH HEM... should we just go upstairs? She turns ""yep, i said it was ready."" Oooooh no. You had better walk my ass right up to my table. Nope, i can already tell the service is going to be abysmal. We walk upstairs. We wait there for almost 5 min. Then i grab a bus boy and in broken espanol, i ask him... neccecitamos una mesa... ya dig? He starts wiping down a table. I ask my date... why the hell do we have reservations again? Then as we are being seated, a hostess girl says, ""oh your table is over here"" WELLL princess, thanks so much for telling me that 10 min ago.... and we sit. The waitress comes over and says ""what can i get ya?"" Excuse me Maude... what is this a diner? Can i get a slice a pie and a glass of manners? I ask her what her name is... i then introduce myself and start to read some of the specials off of the wall. She gets the hint. I hate my decision to come here. We order more martinis... Vodka might make this better. We order some specials... i get meat, lots of it. The food is very good, though pricey. Im still annoyed that there is a $10 cheeseburger on the menu. Dont get me wrong, i love a PBR and a Burger... just not what i was expecting after all of the reviews i read. When the time comes to order dessert, i think to myself... seriously, lets just stop at starbucks. We get our check. The bottom line. This place has good food, but is not a fancy joint. If people said, its a decent bar with good food, i would say: ""heck yes, 4 stars, just needs some better service."" But they think they are classy, and so does yelp... its not. Frankly, It shouldnt have anything on the menu over $27. The service is friggin dreadful. A half drunk toddler could manage this place better. That is all... ",0,1,0,0,0

 No complaints about the drinks every drink I've ordered from here has been good, my complaint is about the wait. Yes it does get the AM rush 6-730, but so do other locations.

I went in about 640 ordered my drink, a shaken green tea lemonade.. and I did not get my drink until 657.. which is RIDICULOUS for a TEA.... I think I counted about 7-8 people who ordered coffess.. fraps, macchiatos, etc AFTER me.. and go their drinks BEFORE me... I noticed the barista working made ALL The coffee drinks first and then took a minute to make my tea... which literally took LESS than a minute. to pour make and give to me.. i will NOT be going back to this starbucks again, maybe during a day.... but NEVER in the morning because I was late for work when i got there in plenty of time!

 Going a bit against the grain with this one, but... On the surface, this Fry's is as good as the next. It's clean and well-stocked. The people ""in the back"" are clearly doing their job and well. However, the ""front line"" is really what makes or breaks a place, if you ask me. Each time I've been here since I moved to the area, I've had problems checking out. The place is slow. The checkers move slowly, and the baggers move slowly. I've only experienced the weekday crew, so maybe the whole vibe changes when the evening and weekend people clock in. I can forgive ""slow"", and I've usually forgotten it before I'm halfway to the car. However, one particular incident the last time I visited this store really stuck in my craw. I absolutely cannot stand listening to employees badmouth ""they"", AKA other employees or even the people that sign their paychecks. The cashier for my line was having trouble scanning things, and blaming the meat department (""THEY cannot stick proper barcodes on things, hence I cannot scan them."") Then the customer in front of me had purchased something enclosed in a security device... more problems (""THEY only do this to slow me down. I don't know who would steal this.""), and so on. Also, the bagger smashed all my produce under cans. You'd think bagging groceries is some kind of art form that humanity hasn't yet mastered... Anyway, perhaps some believe that recreational complaining and smashed produce are all in a day's work at Fry's and I shouldn't complain, but I think it's downright unprofessional. An otherwise pleasant shopping experience shouldn't end like this. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I dined at STK a couple years back, and I remember thinking, it was just OK. It was on my birthday and I enjoyed the company and celebration. I didn't let it bother me. When I was invited to go again, and for free, I figured, why not? Either I stepped up my steak game, or STK fell off even more because overall- NOTHING impressed me. Wait, I fib, the mushroom pot pie side dish was good enough to order again. So out of a dinner that would have cost $145, the best part was a side dish?!!? My boyfriend and I ordered the gyoza, a field greens salad, the 20oz ribeye sliced, the mushroom pot pie, and a panna cotta dessert. First, sharing is the way to go. Other than the potstickers being extremely small, coming with only 4, and costing $19- I was happy with the portions and servings. They offered to split the salad and slice the steak, very appreciated for things like that. They staff was on game, they cleared our plates and gave us fresh silverware after every dish. The salad needed more of the cheese and croutons. That's what made it enjoyable. The steak was just ok. Not amazing, not bad. The bacon butter on top was super succulent. The side of mushrooms came in a classic looking pot pie crust, and when you cut into it there were about 4 types of mushrooms in a creamy sauce. It was the highlight of the night! The panna cotta, never again! Wrong consistency and just all around not enough flavor for me. Another downfall- one glass of wine is $17. I understand fancy steakhouses charging more for specialty cocktails, high end liquor, etc. But even then it ranges about $10-$15. $17 for a glass of mediocre wine, is pathetic. I get STK's concept. A sexy club feel with high end food. Except that wasn't the vibe I got. More like a cutting corners steakhouse that caters to the local adult industry, rich tourist, and old men who like the eye candy. Vegas needs that, don't get me wrong. I am not hating on the adult industry in the least. But when there are well known Vegas working girls that dine there on the regular, it attracts a certain crowd. You wouldn't see those same girls down the street at Herb & Rye, thank God. Overall, my favorite part was the DJ bumping 90's jams, and the mushrooms. I will gladly skip out on the drunk, red head tourist sitting next to me screaming, and spilling stinky wine, and the pervy old guys. However, Vegas has a place for everyone, this is just not mine.

 This is a family owned and operated business, no corporate restaurant BS. Good, healthy food, no smoking, and great service. When I was there, everyone in the place was happy and smiling; cooks, waiters, waitresses, customers. After several weeks of dining in and around Vegas, this place was a ray of sunshine!

 We went to Dobhan for brunch after discovering the diner across the street had a long wait. It was our second choice but ended up being a good one. The eclectic brunch menu offered up some breakfast classics such as eggs Benedict as well as some less ordinary options including eggs on chili con carne and dhosa (a kind of crispy crepe) filled with scrambled eggs. Everything looked and tasted delicious. While I can't speak to their regular menu, I can definitely say that I would have no hesitation returning to Dobhan again. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Thank you, Brand, for offering such an amazing value on your prix fixe menu for Yelp's Spring Break! I admit, that's why I came - having never really heard much about the restaurant, but what a gem! We were even there right when dinner started, and although we were one of the only folks in the place, the service and ambiance still made it feel very special. And on that note - service was really great. For our starters, Mr. L and I shared the Hot Rocks and the Brand Salad. Hot Rocks was so much fun! What's not to love about an 850F rock that you cook razor thin slices of sirloin on. And the amount of flavor they were able to get in those little slices was surprising, too. The Brand Salad: I know, salad, boring, right?... no. There wasn't even lettuce in the salad --- straight shrimp, green beans, and tomatoes --- big chunks of shrimp, and plenty to share. Impressive. Entrees: Let's be honest, we both wanted the 12oz bone in Brooklyn Filet... but in the interest of variety, we only got one, and we got the Chilean Sea Bass. And quite honestly, I think the Sea Bass was a contender for the title. Both were amazing. Tender/flaky, perfectly cooked, seasoned, the works. The risotto with the Sea Bass was also a winner, and was cooked with lobster broth and gave me even *more* shrimp! What's not to love? There's also nothing not to love about the mac and cheese, and believe me, I know my mac and cheese. This had a thick creaminess to it, with that crunchy breadcrumb topping. Lots of flavor, lots of cheese, nicely cooked pasta. Dessert was just excessive, but we forced down one of them... Baked Alaska was a nice meal ender - not too heavy, strawberry icecream concoction. I'd order that again. We brought the cheesecake home and that made for a great breakfast ;-) Wine list was also pretty extensive and had a good range in prices. I'd definitely go back for a special night - I might split a few more dishes than I did, but hey, hard to turn down such a generous prix fixe deal! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Other than the beautiful decor, there is really not a whole lot to this place. If you have a craving that just cannot wait and you are at Caesar's then you don't have much choice. The garlic pepper crab was not too bad and was probably the best dish we had. But most of the other dishes are extremely salty because it is Beijing style, but the chef has a particularly high salt palate, even then. The waitress admitted that they get a lot of complaints about the saltiness of the food, but there is nothing they can do about it. Service is an atrocity - textbook for what you should NOT do. We were seated at a table that was filthy underneath. When I pointed this out to the hostess, she told me to just change seats. They refused to clean it up. She has to be one of the laziest people I have met in my life. I was going to complain to the manager, but even she is a piece of work. We sat next to the kitchen, and I guess one of the other tables sent back a dish because it was too salty. Then she and the staff started to bad mouth the customer right in front of us. Of course, it was in Chinese, but we still understood. She used the entire gamut of expletives to describe the customer and started to give them a dirty look every time she walked by their table. Loosely translated, it went something like - eff them, they don't know s**t, nit picking. WOW. This place will never again have my business. With an attitude like that and such disregard for customer respect, I cannot trust what they will do to my food if I ever made even a slight complaint. So I know what the 9 in restaurant name stands for. Nine reasons why should not eat here ",1,0,0,0,0

 Since everyone eventually reviews P.F. Chang's, I thought I would give you all an alternative, a great, Americanized Chinese food restaurant. The Golden Phoenix is a great example of a successful Chinese restaurant. They do excel in most ways but fall short in others. First off, for an appetizer, get the Mu Shu, its the best I've found in town. The Hot and Sour Soup is great too, good balance of flavors. Great noodles, and rice always seems fresh. Most of the chicken and tofu entrees are cooked extremely well, as the chicken is tender and tofu is firm and sauteed well. Now for the not so good, stay away from beef entrees. As most Chinese restaurants, the beef used is from a cut that needs to be finessed, its tough if not cooked delicately, most of the time its cooked too long and gets rubbery, Michelin/Goodyear like. Stick with chicken or tofu. As for the service and decor both are better then most. The restaurant looks like a Chinese restaurant should, bright with Asian decor. The service is prompt and professional. As a previous review stated, they don't handle parties well, I disagree, I planned a party for 25 and they handled it quite well. In fact when the check came I tipped above the automatic gratuity (reserved for large parties). Take out is outstanding as I tend to call in my order and pick up rather then a take out from Pei Wei (support the little guy!). To make things easier the menu is available online at their website. Here is the web address, at this time though its not loading properly, check again if the page is not available. http://goldenphoenixrestaurant.com/ ",0,0,0,1,0

 When I first moved out here, I would say that I was here on average of every other week. Obviously came for the drinks, ambiance, and sometimes their food. But keep in mind, food here is basically appetizers. I have to admit, their seared Ahi is too legit to quit. My last time here was Halloween this year. I had to pay $20 to get in while my friends only had to pay $10 (ladies got it good). Regardless, not use to having to pay to get in, but I guess that's Hello Ween for you. Place was packed as expected inside and out. Everyone was in costumes and after a couple of drinks, it got a bit old. Drinks are fairly cheap considering...far cheaper than a club or a gentleman's club. I use to come here prior to hitting the strip just because their drinks are cheaper. One note though, sometimes their drinks are watered down. Let them know, and they'll take care of it. Just don't forget to tip. I don't frequent this place as much as I did about a year ago, but it's a nice visit every once in awhile. Place is usually locals, but I do recommend for tourist. A nice change for sure. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Yum, got to love a good smoothie. Whoever got the idea, however long ago, to blend fruit and other dairy products together to make an amazing taste concoction and in the process make being healthy appeal to everyone...well, they're clearly pretty awesome. I don't know how anyone can say they don't like fruit, when the magic of a blender can sort you out with any combination of edible items you like in a tasty juicetastic form. Hula does in fact feel a bit Hawaiian, or like a cafe you'd go to abroad at any rate, and it has a really cool vibe to it, with equally cool and banterful staff. If you want a really good choice of smoothies, then this is your place, plus they serve decent food if you're peckish. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ive been having a huge craving for ""red sauce"" these days and decided to check out a new place. I had heard a ton of great things about this place so we decided to go. First off, good luck finding the place. There is no signage on the street or building, we actually walked through the door to the hostess and asked if we were in the right place. We were. We were seated quickly and the staff was all very nice. The music in this place is a touch to loud for a Monday afternoon lunch crowd. For starters we ordered the meatball trio and the fried polenta sticks. Both were freaken amazinnnnng!!!! For pizzas we ordered the standard Pepperoni and then also the Big Star. Both pizzas were good, but didn't knock my socks off. Also they were a bit greasy and the crust was pretty chewy and hard to cut through with a fork. The hubs and I both agreed that we would most likely not be going back unless someone invited us out and that's where they wanted to go. It wasn't a terrible experience it was just meh for us.

 This was a decent outing for us - we didn't love it, but didn't hate it. We bought the Groupon so in total we ended up spending about $30 for 4 people. Our kids are 5 and 2.

We would go back IF there was more to do (included in the fee we already paid) and IF there was no candy-wall. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I lived in SoCal and love, love, LOVE the Sam Woo there, and was so happy when I first moved out here to Vegas in 2008 to see a familiar restaurant in Las Vegas Chinatown. It was one of the first 3 off-strip restaurants that I tried on Spring Mountain. Unfortunately my expectation for quality Chinese food at a reasonable price was quickly shattered by the huge mound of rice and miniscule amount of chicken and vegetables on the plate and the tourist trap prices being charged. The flavor was okay, but trying to justify the price tag by shoveling extra extra rice is not the answer. And I recall thinking WTH! Did this restaurant steal the name of a well-known and much loved restaurant from California??? 2.5 years later, I am still not sure if the restaurant is operated by the same family or is part of the same franchise, but I do know that I didn't want to go back to this crappy Sam Woo ever again, and have been true to my word. And to those reviewers that think real Chinese restaurants do not or should not be bother with offer good service along with good food and still rate this poor imitation of a restaurant a 5 star, I think you should qualify your reviews with disclaimers that the reviews and ratings are for food only. And if I want to pay Casino Chinese restaurant prices for at least mediocre food, why do I have to leave the Strip? Plus, I dare say that a lot of the Chinese restaurants in the high end casinos offer better food than the ones you can get here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Frozen yogurt, ice cream, and then there's frozen custard...definitely a great alternative and worth every bite! The flavors to choose from are vanilla and chocolate. Don't worry cause there are plenty of topping choices. They have sundaes, concretes, and shakes. I just got a small vanilla with strawberries since this was my first visit, I wanted to taste the custard and didn't want anything too fancy. It was delicious! I'm gonna have to comeback and try one of those concretes cause it surely sounded good. I guess you can say a concrete is a mixture of toppings with the yogurt of your choice. The only thing that was disappointing about this place is that is was just a storefront with a walk up window, chairs and tables outside,and a drive thru. It'd be nice if we were actually able to sit inside and enjoy our treats. Otherwise, it really satisfied my sweet tooth. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I saw a sign for this place on our way to the movies this weekend. We stopped by for lunch after our movie. Place is small and so so. Service was really good. We had the humus with meat (great idea), hubby had a gyro sandwich (pita wrap) and he loved it. Fries were good too, tasty and crunchy. I had ordered a cubideh sandwich (wrap) but ended up just eating the humus, and taking the wrap home. Hubby thought humus was kind of bland, I thought it was OK. The meat was like hamburger meat but with herbs and spices, I liked it very much. The portion was reasonable (~$8, it is an appetizer).

 The Best of Phoenix issue did not disappoint me or my daughter. I got a delicious combination of spiciness. The complimentary chips come with a variety of dips - salsa, bean dip, and some kind of creamy goodness. The daughter was a little skeptical of all three options, so more for me. I see other reviews referring to four dips, so maybe I was drunk off of over eating. At the end, they give you a sapodilla to ensure that your belly is full and round. The daughter was happy about that and I had to roll myself back to the car. ",0,0,0,0,1

 What's the deal Lucille? Disappointing. I forgive those who 4 and 5 star the baby back ribs, for they simply don't know better. Kinda dry, kinda lacking a masterfully applied smokey flavor, kinda skinny on the meat, which would be forgivable, had they rocked in the flavor department. Skinny fries were good. Cold slaw decent, didn't suck, no wow factor either. I had to go find my own damn silverware and napkin. Not once did the server ask if I wanted a refill for my beverage. It was exactly what I expected, pure mediocrity across the board, including 90% of the half assed attempt of outsider folk art on the walls and watered down blues on the sound system. I would have never stepped foot here, but met my folks and their friends. Lucille, your meal did not appeal. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Ive been here a few times since its attached to the casino @ flamingo (where I sometimes stay) sometimes i get a margarita to-go, and other times I've chilled at the bar, i usually go for the ""Perfect margarita"" over ice along with some chips and salsa. i haven't tried any of the food yet. but the HUGE volcano nachos and the burgers seem to be heavily filling the tables when Ive come. The restaurant has two bars the 1st ones in the front of the restaurant and there's a (standing only) little patio which is facing out to the strip. good for people watching and catching a breeze where the weathers nice. the 2nd bar is in the back of the restaurant by the stage/projection setup For those who want a souvenir there's a gift shop @ the entry of the restaurant which sells glassware, margarita mixes, shirts,flip/flops, hats etc.. **tip #1 ** there's a 2-4-1 coupon for their ""whose to blame"" margarita in the fun book they give you when you stay @ the flamingo.

 If Yelp had an evil twin equivalent of the ROTD (Review Of The Day), this would win hands down. To the reader, I am not taking responsibility for your well being if you still choose to eat here especially after reading this review. Let's start from the beginning. I bring my wife and two boys. I order 4 pastor tacos for me and my oldest. A cheese quesadilla for my youngest, and an order of asada fries for all of us to share. So the food comes out. It all looks good. But looks can be deceiving. You know when people say don't judge a good book by its cover. Well this cover looks good but once you read the first page, it will make you want to rip it in half and burn it. For starters, the pastor was dry like it has been on the spit for days. That's really funny because there was oil literally pouring out of the tortilla when I pick it up. My guess is that they dipped it in hot oil before throwing it in the tortilla. I should of took pictures of the plate it was on because it was literally transparent from all the grease. The quesadilla should of been called a ""greasadilla"". My youngest only took a couple bites before he had to stop because of grease running down his chin and fore arms. The tortilla itself was already soggy. As for the asada fries I was hoping that would be the saving grace to this horrible experience so far. I was wrong. Boy was I wrong. I took a picture of it and posted it on here. It looks decent. But when we started eating it, we noticed they had used nacho cheese instead of shredded cheddar. For nachos that might be ok. But for fries that's a major no no. The meat was also greasy like they dipped it in oil to bring it to life. The only decent things about it was the sour cream and guacamole. We ate or should I say tried to eat at least half of our food but it seemed like with every bite our stomachs were screaming bloody murder. But alas, we had to dump it in the trash. So in closing, memo to ""Pepe"", can you please cut down on the grease and at least make the tacos just a tad bit bigger? Once you do that, then maybe I will give you guys another try. ",1,0,0,0,0

 it was a very rainy sunday evening that brought me to Mamma's for dinner with friends. as the grassmarket is a fair trek from my part of town, i hadn't visited before so didn't really know what to expect besides the offering of pizza. the menu is pretty standard for a pizza place, loads of pizza toppings to choose from, a variety of pizza sizes, a number of sides to accompany, and pasta dishes if that is what you'd rather go for. i got a small pizza with artichoke, olives, goats cheese, and garlic tomatoes and we all opted to spilt a side of chili cheese fries. food arrived fairly quickly, but i was left less than impressed. my pizza was ok, the toppings were nice but the sauce lacked any real taste and the base was a bit too stodgy for my liking. the chili cheese fries were tasty though so that was a bit of a saving grace. while the service was good, i feel like i can't really comment on that much as we were pretty much the only customers in that night. the waitress was friendly though which is always appreciated. however, the restaurant itself is a bit tired looking and could use a good clean... not a great thought when you're sat down for a nice dinner. i think this review might have been three stars but i felt that the price i paid for mediocre food was a bit high. if memory serves me right, i paid almost \ u00a320 for my pizza and portion of the chili fries, which was a bit high for something i didn't really enjoy. so overall, not really impressed with Mamma's and i'm unlikely to make the effort to go back.

 Wow talk about being disappointed. You look at this guys website and you think wow this has to be the greatest cheesesteak I ever tasted in my whole life . But then again in his website he said that all the best Philly cheese steak places in Philadelphia does not chop up their steak he is 100 % wrong. If anybody knows I do cause I worked at the original cheesesteak place in Philadelphia the 1st cheestake joint the place where the cheesestake was invented Pats... First thing he does wrong is he does not season his meat. And the reason why I know is because i was standing by the counter and i didn't see him season the meat At Pats the way we cooked our steaks is first we took 6 ounces (that was weighted in advanced ) of rib eye put it on the gill that was already splatted with a little bit of oil season the meat with salt a pinch of black pepper and Paparika... Hanks not have does not give you any meat At all I doubt if there was 4 ounces of meat on that sandwich and maybe one slice of American cheese. I don't mind paying $10 for a sandwich but give me something to eat I could've eaten 4 of those sandwiches and I still would've been full.. I could tell that the meat was very good it was fresh and the bread was pretty good ..But for gods sake let's stop being a cheapskate I know about food cost but come on you're charging almost $10 for a freakin sandwich.. Talk about being a stone face the guy never smiled his wife I'm assuming it's his wife had nothing to say..

 Beware!! They didn't even deserve a one star. This company and leasing managers are racist and treat people like they are nothing. All they want is you to sign on the dotted line and they got you! The 1 bedroom apartment we rented was a fucking DUMP when we moved in. The ceiling fan was ready to fall on our heads, there was black all over the a/c vents and the shelves in the closet were literally falling off the wall and the carpet had huge nasty stains everywhere. We were told our place was clean and ready to move in. I have a medical condition called Cystic Fibrosis, I am on a lot of medication and my meds get delivered by UPS or FedEx to the front office. After the third box of my meds arrived, in about a weeks time, the leasing staff labeled me as being contagious and treated me like dirt. After being there for two months, my doctor at MUSC in Charleston told me I have to live close to the hospital in order to get proper treatment and be able to go into the hospital when I am sick. We gave a written notice to the leasing manager and a doctors letter. The manager said, oh that's fine don't worry about it feel better (in her fake voice). Now, two years later I see they have put me on collection for $2000. No way will they get away with this. Do not rent from these Losers! How do they sleep at night ",1,0,0,0,0

 Well kids, you all know the deal: no on touches my hair and no one is going to have to go down to the Royal Infirmary to have their hand sewn back on. There is one exception to this rule and her name is Jenni: as per usual, this absolutely fabulous wonder of a woman has been able to transform my lackluster, mess of a kraken, into a beautiful mermaid's net ready to entangle the nearest innocent bystander. (The innocents taste better). Jenni has moved to Danielle Carr recently and although the salon is definitely smaller than Medusa, the atmosphere is also a lot more ... amiable. I found Medusa a little forced at times with the techno music and the general loudness, but this is more a place to relax, though I'm afraid when I came here the general loudness level of the salon was upped a little. The people here are friendly and clearly work well together in a team, and as for Jenni? Magic, pure magic, as per usual. The great thing about a truly great hairdresser is that you never have to tell her exactly what you want, you just flop your hands about a bit, say some general words in a certain direction and she takes over and just knows. Now, you might say, that's because you've been going to her for two years now. Yes, that's part of it, and you should be too, but most of it is her intuition. Jenni is good at consultation and damned if she isn't even better at colouring and cutting. I've seen her transform a mess of a Hungarian fro (we won't name names) into an ice-cool hair do in under twenty minutes. Whot. WHOT. Yes, truly. I didn't think it was possible but that cut is so fresh that the man in question now has a whole new attitude to match it. My hair, you ask? Fabulous, as always. Golden and glowing down my back in undulating waves and healthy to boot. Hairdressers, truly great ones, are really rare, and most of them get a little scissor happy when they think they can get away with it. Not Jenni, or if she does get scissor happy, you won't notice, 'cause it will simply look exactly as it ought to. Go forth, go here, and know that this is an investment in never having to worry about how to do your hair again. Ever. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This was the first house I bought on my own and Greg made the whole experience very easy. He was always punctual and flexible in his availability to look at houses. And we looked at quite a few houses! All the while Greg was very helpful in guiding me through making some changes to my budget and the locations in which I was searching, giving me advice on what I can compromise on. After doing some shopping on my own, Greg also connected me to a mortgage broker and I got an excellent financing deal! As we looked at houses he was knowledgeable about the listing agents and had a strategy on how he might work with each agent. Through the offer process Greg was a great advocate for me, partnering with the seller's agent to negotiate a price and ensure repairs were completed. Greg has a lot of experience in the Phoenix real estate market, is a part of the community of realtors and had a wealth of information and referrals for all kinds of resources. I highly recommend him and will definitely work with him again! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I went to see the 5 p.m. showing of ""Evan Almighty"" recently and had a fun experience. The theatre is unlike any movie theatre I've ever been to and I love that you can order dinner and cocktails during the screening. The menu is large and diverse and there's even a children's menu. This is a good place for families and couples. It's not ideal for a night out with the girls. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My final meal in Phoenix, which was breakfast. This small brick place has made me famous with the name (of course) and was honored with a ""Review of the day"", which seems like a distant-memory ago. My first visit and first meal back then was a monumental one. Will my return to ""my"" breakfast place be a repeat? Some things hasn't changed much about my place. There was a little wait for a table, especially on a early weekday morning. ""My place...why should I have to wait for a table?"" This time, my return back has got me ordering one of the breakfast specials, which was the Salami Scramble. For $5.95 and affordable meal too, I get three scrambled eggs mixed with Soppresata Salami with a side of Hash Browns and a pair of thick toasted Sourdough Bread with Strawberry Preserves. The crispiness of the sliced salami blended with the scramble eggs made it a tasty combination. The hash browns were tasty and a nice compliment to my meal. And the thick-ass toasted Sourbread bread with melted butter and the preserves was crunchy with a powerful explosion that can be heard all over the small diner (in a good way). My place hasn't failed in my return. I'm always welcome to come back and dine at my breakfast place whenever I come back to Phoenix. And so, you can too. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The red flocked wallpaper--the leather banquettes--the way you feel like a Goodfella when you walk in through the kitchen--you know you're at Durant's! This is one of the bastions of Old Phoenix at its best--or maybe its worst, since a lot of the bad old days of corrupt city governance likely took place within Durant's walls. But since the staff is so discreet, we'll probably never know... Now to the food: I really like the food, the wines, the service. I've had prime rib here and it was great prime rib.

 I give it 2 stars for bring open on Sunday, but it's really only worth 1 star. The employees are nice, but everything is computerized and it makes me think that they work on commission. They tried to sell me things I had previously purchased and they kept lowering the price by a dollar and saying ""so now do you want it?"" I just came for an oil change. I expected to be told about what else needs to be done, but other places which actually care about the user experience will print you a list of needs and their prices. That would have been respectable instead of trying to intimidate you with a computer. Hahaha, don't even try it buddy:/ I ended up waiting about an hour and a half to even be seen, but when I called the girl told me I could get an oil change right away:/. When I called I asked to make an appointment. This place is like a snake. I. Wouldn't necessarily blame it in the employees, I'd blame it on jiffy lube. I do NOT recommend coming here unless like me, ur oil is in sure need of change on a Sunday:( ",0,1,0,0,0

 On a three-day work trip to Las Vegas, I joined my team at the Mesa Grill for lunch on the first day. It completely embodied how I feel about Vegas in general. The walk to the restaurant through Caesar's Palace forum shops was long, twisty, and needless. Made me wonder if there were a more direct route, or the people I was with just wanted to go shopping. The walk was OK in that it did increase our appetites. Once at Mesa, The hostess sat us down, gave us some menus, and we waited for the rest of our party to show up before being shown our table. Our table sat a dozen comfortably as it was long enough. The waiter had give his speech twice to cover each end of the table. I was looking forward to the meal; I've seen Bobby Flay on Food Network countless times. I started with the Gala Apple Salad (baby spinach, Maytag blue cheese, toasted pecans with a spicy orange vinaigrette). The salad was spicy, but lacked enough spinach to really enjoy it as a salad. the vinaigrette dominated everything to the point where you couldn't really taste the individual ingredients. There was too much of it. I did like the texture. I wasn't wowed. Next up was the Mahi Mahi fish tacos. Again, the food was good. The sauce dominated. And with a serving size so big, why did I have to ask for more tortillas? When has two ever been enough? I ordered off menu for dessert. I did enjoy the egg shaped scoops of toasted pecan ice cream. For a meal I didn't pay for, it was good. The company was great. The service was attentive for the first 3/4 of it. There's no way I'll be clamoring to go back anytime soon. And all of this is how I feel about Vegas. You look forward to these things you've heard about for years. There's a lot of waiting and wondering. There glitz and super-sized overshadows everything. Without good people, it's not really that enjoyable. Not disappointed. Just should have known better. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Recently they had a new employee and he did not know how to perform online order pickups. And he turned off the 5 minute timer, then 8 minutes later came out with my item. Fail. The manager corrected the situation with their promised $5 coupon for not having the item within 5 minutes and spoke with the employee. This was appreciated and thus the 4/5 stars instead of less. Otherwise the online pickup is quite good and the regular employees are very good at their job back there. They don't fool around, likely the $5 5 minute promise helps with that. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This show was great! I've been to five other Cirque shows and this was one of the best. I can see why some people go to see it several times, because it is such a feast for the eyes that there is always somewhere new to look. I was so enthralled with the flooring alone! The show is almost 2 hours long, which I liked. It felt like I got my money's worth for the number of acts. If you are only going to see 1 show in Vegas, I highly recommend this one. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Overall service and wait time was why I gave it 3 stars. The view was nice able to see part of the bellagio water show. I brought my mom and although the sushi was a bit disappointing, the overall experience made up for it. Although, if you bring seniors..make sure it's before 10pm. Otherwise, they start playing really loud hip hop music and it's hard to hear across the table. 1) Service: Impeccable, and had one guy take the order, one guy delivering the drinks, and another delivering the food. It wasn't busy yet so perhaps they were working the tip angle. 2) Seating: If possible, try to use opentable (not only can you score points, but you can request the window area to sit with at least a view). The inside area was more bamboo like but the tables seemed quite close to each other so I was glad to sit near the window. The sofas were quite comfy but a bit too deep (had to stuff 2 pillows behind me so that I could sit up straight). You can however practically take a nap on those sofas but definitely different feel. The inside area reminds me of the KOI location in los angeles. 3) Food: Down to the nitty gritty the sushi wasn't all bad but the portion size of typical sushi restaurants were definitely small. We ordered the seared kobi on top of the roll and what we got was uncooked beef. We had to send back the order for the meat to be cooked all the way through. I guess I'm not the pro sushi eater however I do like my meat cooked. We ordered another different kobi dish but it was just strips of kobe beef with some sauce and mushrooms. All I had to ask was WHERE WERE THE MUSHROOMS? Perhaps they were shredded but the restaurant was too dark to really notice anyways. There went another $22 bucks...haha. The dessert was really good. I ordered the creme brulee which had a vanilla like taste to it and it wasn't too sweet inside nor on top (burnt crust) which was nice. We ordered the eel and avocado but there was another roll that was similar but more expensive. So make sure you know the specifics of the names of the rolls so you don't end up ordering two of the same thing. I would go back for the ambiance if there weren't other sushi places to go to, but will venture out to others on my next trip to vegas. ",0,0,1,0,0

It would be 45 mins to get the correct order so he credited me a large pizza for next time. I can careless for the free pizza.

 As an Italian from NY, this place is really a 2.5 for the pizza, but it gets an extra half-star for two reasons: 1. It's probably the best pizza in the area, and certainly convenient if you're at the Cosmopolitan. 2. They have oregano, red pepper, and the other condiments usually only found in pizza places with true NY roots. If you're from NY, this pizza will be substandard. Decent, yes. Cheap? For Vegas, sure. But that being said, it's very good for what it is. A tad oily, as others have mentioned, but not a show stopper. The line was long when I went there; fortunately, there were cool people in line with me to chat with. Took around 15 minutes to order, and a whole pie would have taken an additional 30 minutes - and this was at 3pm. I opted for a few slices instead, which were ready after a quick warm-up. There's better food in Vegas - and certainly in the Cosmopolitan. But for quick, cheap, and acceptable pizza, look no further. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have visited other Petcos in the Phoenix area and have always had a great experience. After taking my pets to get groomed at this location for a couple of times I was not satisfied and would tell the staff about what I was unhappy about. They would then do fix what they did wrong. The last time I called to schedule an appointment I was refused service due to the fact that I was never happy with the service. I was refused service due to the fact that I demand my money's worth.

 ""Yay! IT'S SUGAR!"" Later on it be like ""Damn, I need insulin!"" For those that aren't diabetic and plan on walking up and down the street all day or night, I guess a bag full of candy should help you with lots of extra energy with that unavoidable sugar rush. This place is huge compared to some others on the strip. Your options here are pretty much endless and if you have way too much energy as a result of excessive sugar intake, well what do you know, there just happens to be Tao Nightclub across the way so maybe you can dance that extra energy away. I can mention a few things here and there in regards to what they carry but I can pretty much guarantee you that they will have what you are looking for. You can go for the pick whatever you want and put it in a bag technique, which is charged by weight. Or you can just buy what ever is already pre packaged in boxes. In the end, you don't necessarily have to get anything if you are just checking the place out. If you must have to get something, I recommend getting the chocolate covered gummy bears.

 After having heard great things about the Flamingo and also having fun at Margaritaville I thought that it would be fun to stay at the Flamingo. Thank goodness we only stayed one night. The room was dirty with trash under the bed,black stains on the sheets,several burn marks all over the carpets and the bathroom...oh my goodness. The ceiling had some weird panel that was rusty ,a hole that looked like it used to house a camera and a disgusting vent that was covered in dirt. Why are all of these thing in the shower? I am glad we only stayed 1 night. Apparently if you do not spring the extra $$ for one of their ""GO"" rooms you will be guaranteed a stay in a old,dirty,seemingly forgotten about room. I am a huge fan of Vegas and know there are much better options than the Flamingo for similar cost. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My co-workers brought me to this truly culinary gem, hidden within the Palace Station Casino during our one of company trips to SEMA. After walking 5 mins through the Palace Station Casino. You will find yourself @ the Oyster Bar and most likely a long line. **20-40min wait** The Oyster bar seats about 18-20 ppl. While waiting in line, I was told by my co-workers and people in line that the Palace Pan Roast and the fresh raw oyster were A-Must try. The Palace Pan Roast is a big bowl of delicious creole broiled goodness; it comes with shrimp, crab meat, and sausages mixed together in a tasty stock of creamy, tomato stew. They will ask you how spicy you what your pan roast, I got something between mild and spicy, which was just the right for me. You have the options of a scoop of rice or pasta to go along with your yummy Pan Roast. All this is cooked live in front of you with stream powered pots. My co-workers ordered 2 dozen of the raw oysters, but I wasn't in the mood for raw oysters that night. They looked delicious, and fresh enough for me to have some, when I return to Vegas this summer. They were HUGE too! Oyster Bar has made it on my list of places to stop by everytime I am in Vegas now. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We found a 20% off voucher in our room at the Palazzo so we decided to try this place out. They have outdoor as well as indoor seating. I would have sat outside if the weather permitted, but it was just way too hot. The first thing I noticed was the ratio of employees vs patrons. There were definitely more servers and busboys than people eating so we had very attentive service. I started out with Kumamoto oysters on the half shell and my entr \ u00e9e was Linguini Clam. The oysters were ok... not super fresh, but still good. The clam in my linguini were definitely not fresh though...It was pretty bland too... nothing to write home about. I tried some of the duck rillette. It was flavorful, but I just don't really enjoy items like that... It was very convenient if you are staying at Palazzo, but I doubt I would come back since there are so many other options on the strip in Vegas. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It was my first time coming here and my entire experience was absolutely terrible. It was pretty empty for 12pm. My husband and I ordered the thai salad wrap as an appetizer. Not only was the meat overpowered with too much peanut sauce, the lettuce wasn't fresh. I ordered the pad kee Mao that comes with a side of jasmine rice. The rice was very dry, the beef was chewy, veggies were soggy, and the sauce was quite bland. My husband ordered the spicy thai pasta that also lacked in flavor. The server also forgot that I ordered the tom gati soup and I had to remind him two times to bring it out. It came out 30 mins after eating our main entrees. That as well, failed in flavor. The mushrooms were over cooked and the broth did not go down well. We are not picky eaters, but we are able to differ between great food and completely tasteless food. Our overall experience was not pleasant due to the service, the restaurant looking like it hasn't been updated since 1940s, and every dish not being good. Sorry, but wouldn't come back a second time or recommend this place to others. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Not too shabby, not sure if worth more stars... 1. Location - Great location in strip mall, easy parking and easy to get to. 2. Ambiance - really nice and relaxing. We went early, so no music which allowed us talk and converse in peace. 3. Service - Not bad, yet this place could have improvement in this area as it is adequate, and not terrific. 4. Price - Very Reasonable. 5. Food - The hummos had a very nice texture. the babaghanoush was succulant with its wonderful smoke / grilled flavor. All the entrees were okay, and not great and I would have expected more great flavors in all other foods. I ordered the dish with extra steamed vegetables and I got instead an order of frozen type vegetables that was fried or with oil instead of steamed. Check this place out.

 I've walked past this place so many times, and it's always been empty. I've always wondered what the deal was, but never really curious enough to venture inside. I'm glad it's open again now so that I can finally give it a try (heard it's under new ownership. so I suppose now it's not really the same restaurant... oh well). Well I stopped in recently, and I was very impressed. I went on a Saturday afternoon... and it was still empty; it was around 1:30 so not peak lunch hour or anything, but I wonder if a lot of people still think it's closed. It looks like the place is still coming together (one of their storefront signs was sitting on the a table inside, and there was some kitchen equipment inexplicably sitting in one corner of the dining room), but it was comfortable enough inside. The menu is small, which is great for a BBQ place in my opinion; the focus should be on making a few things (meat, we're talking meat here) very well instead of trying to cater to every taste. I was just feeling like something small to eat, a lunch item, so I ordered the pulled pork nachos appetizer. Definitely not small! This is easily a four person appetizer, and even though I was very hungry I barely got through them. It was pretty standard plating for nachos: chips, cheese (lots of it!), salsa (standard canned Pace-style, I believe :/...), meat, lettuce, some chopped red onions and a dollop of sour cream. It looked really good (see my picture), and it tasted incredible as well, The pulled pork was fantastic! I mean it was all good, but the pork stood out even amongst the strong flavors of the sharp cheddar, salsa, and onions. It was perfectly tender and smokey. I definitely also made frequent and spirited use of the 2 BBQ sauce squeeze bottles on the table, one a ""classic"" sauce and the other a spicy iteration. Having the sauce on the table MAKES a BBQ joint for me, so I really appreciate it. I'll give them some time to get the place together and then get back there for a more meat-centric meal. And I fully expect I'll be rewarding them that 5th star at that time. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I used to despise this place. Partially, it was because I was a teen at the time they opened and they had a 9 PM curfew (which was sometimes enacted at 7 or even 6) which was a major no-no for a place with movies and an arcade (seeing that when I was a teen in Vegas you pretty much had no choice but to go to a casino for either of those things. The whippersnappers these days have it so much easier). But I also had legitimate grown-up reasoning for my disdain of the place too. It was a locals place masquerading as a strip joint. The service was rude and stuck up. The atmosphere was pretentious. It attracted way too many douchebags and ""pretending to be rich"" types. It was a giant testament to ""trying too hard."" Then the recession happened. And with the recession the ""high-end locals place"" thing backfired. Majorly. After this, the Red Rock hotel finally got off of it's high horse and back down to reality. The curfew relaxed. There were no more ""bouncers"" wandering around. Everything got less expensive. After being weary of the place for so long, it finally started to have appeal for me. The movie theater is one of the nicest in town and my personal go-to whenever I want to see a movie. The buffet is one of the best in town and the Grand Cafe is fantastic. Oh, and did I mention that the sports book bar has $1 margaritas year round? Because it does. I recently stayed in a room here, and I was impressed. The bathtub was deep and incredibly relaxing. The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever laid down in. I had an amazing view of Red Rock Canyon and the pool area. It's a shame that this hotel stay was in the winter, cuz the pool garden was to die for. Sadly, the in-room wi-fi was sluggish, which was a stark contrast from the lobby and casino wi-fi. Unfortunately, from a gambling perspective, this isn't a place where I have very much luck. Definitely some of the tightest slots in town (which is strange for a Station). However, in spite of the fact that I've been over-21 for a couple of years now, I really appreciate how the place isn't so antagonistic towards youth anymore. Even though it no longer applies to me either way, it shouldn't be a hassle for kids and teens to do the things that people in their age brackets typically do like see movies, play in arcades or go bowling. The Final Verdict Pros: No longer the wannabe-Wynn monstrosity it once was. Fantastic hotel rooms. Beautiful pool garden. Mid-Century, Palm Springs-ish feel in architecture and atmosphere. One of the best movie theaters in town. Great on-site dining. At Downtown Summerlin's doorstep. Cons: Tight slots Can still be rather pretentious in some areas. Crappy hotel room wi-fi. Return Factor: 10/10. I would love to stay in one of their rooms again. Preferably during the warmer months so I can hit that pool. ",0,0,0,1,0

 So I finally got the hubby to Vegas----he doesn't gamble and he is not a drinker-- so the next best thing to do in Vegas is to go to a show!!! There are so many shows in Vegas and it was so hard to narrow my choices down! As the trip planner my hubby told me he really wanted to go a magic show. We thought about a Cirque Soli but we were like noooo, you can see those when they travel to your local city and they were pricey. I googled magicians and the reviews were mixed and they were also very pricey. I didn't want to pay too much for a magic show and regret it. Then I wanted to go to concert but lucky us--- the week we came all of the singing performances we wished to see were on break. After much research and with the help of living social I narrowed my search down to V and Absinthe. With further research I noticed comments that said Absinthe had vulgar language, it cost more, and other things that made me opt out. So with the help of Living Social, I purchased tickets to the V show! While purchasing, I had the option to do the regular seats and a free photo (with this you have to be there 45 minutes before show time) or I could pay a few bucks more and only arrive 15 minutes before show time. I chose to pay the few bucks more and give us more time to get there. Once we arrived there was an issue--- the original show time we were scheduled to see was canceled. The employees informed me the show was canceled and our show was moved to another time and we should have received a notice. I did not receive the notice and the manager had to be called out. For the inconvenience the manager supplied us to tickets to another show in Planet Hollywood, that was happening during our original show time. I wasn't really happy with the outcome-- I feel like they should have thrown in drink vouchers or something else but whatever we went to the other show and came back at the new V show time. So I'm sure you are like why are you giving this place a five if all that happened??? Well because the show was EXCELLENT!!! It was everything my husband and I wanted to see. There was magic, tricks, jokes, comedy, and so much more! The host-Wally was very funny and so were many of the other performers. There was a woman and a guy doing tricks in a small area on roller skates, a female magician, two body builder men lifting each other in weird ways, and more. My favorite part was the Crazy Gauchos and Melinda the female magician. There was no nudity during the show and the women were well enough dressed (esp. for Vegas). The host Wally kept us very entertained in between acts and there was a lot of performer and audience interaction. I don't want to give away too much detail but I promise it was a great show! Vegas shows can be very pricey but for the price we paid ( I think with out the voucher the show is reasonable) for this hour and half of entertainment--it was well worth our short time in Vegas and I could not have been happier with my choice. After the show we picked up our photos (that we took before the show) and did a meet and greet with all the cast members. You can take pictures with them and have them sign autographs. My husband--who is generally hard to please enjoyed this show as well and we both would go again. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I don't understand the hype about this place. I think it must be a nostalgia thing for people that grew up on it. The chili is absolutely disgusting. It resembles canned cat food. It looks like it's been pre-eaten and takes on whatever shape and design is on it's lid, if you added cornstarch you could probably use it like play dough. The burgers are very sub par and you get better fries in a high school cafeteria. My 3 year old wouldn't touch any of her food after the first bite...and she eats anything and everything. Go to in n out, it seems like that's what their going for anyway. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the location is convenient. ",0,1,0,0,0

 BEWARE OF THE COUPONS! We bought a coupon on Living Social for $50 worth of food for $25. It sounded like a pretty good deal, however... when we went to the restaurant we found out that the coupon is only good for about 8 entree items on the menu. If you don't want to eat one of those 8 items then the coupon is worth only $25, or exactly what you paid for it. We didn't see anything we wanted in the entree items so we ended up just using the coupon for what we paid for it. I'm sure there is some small print somewhere that says that the coupon is only good for the entree items but it does seem like a bait and switch. The food was actually pretty good but the whole coupon thing left a bad taste in my mouth. We live in Las Vegas but I don't think we will ever go back there and I would definitely warn others to stay away. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Towed and ticketed for parking 1 inch into an unused driveway of a closed industrial area! We were horrified to find our car missing after leaving the fair at 9:45 pm on Wed night. We parked at 7:30 pm on Willetta between 18th and 19th Ave. There are two commercial driveways that are hard to see. Apparently this is an area that police ticket and tow vehicles frequently. No signs indicate no parking or where you will be towed. We were lucky that someone on a bike told us the Phoenix police have up to 60 vehicles towed a night for the most minor parking violations and showed us the impound area which is on Grand Ave under the I-10 overpass. You are forced to pay $104 to the city for an administration fee plus $25 to the tow truck company plus another $70 to the city for the parking violation. Yikes, so much for saving on $2 ride night! This is a huge money maker for the city, please beware. Too bad that signs are not posted to warn fair attendees of this highly monitored parking patrol. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Don't understand what all the fuss is about? They do have a great craft beer selection but almost everything is a 12oz pour ranging in price from $7 to $8.50 which is a bit pricey if you ask me! When we inquired about the wine about half of them weren't in stock. The fish tacos were good but nothing spectular and parking is flat out horribe. The major upside to this place was the sweet patio overlooking Indian School and the quick service. I would definitely trek the 1 mile to OHSO for a beer/ hangout if in the area again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Best mac and cheese around, interesting and delicious drinks, and awesome wait staff. This is another dog-friendly gem. They have water bowls for your dogs and a huge patio that's beautiful in AZ's nicer months. The building is really architecturally interesting - it has a huge window that makes you feel like you're in the bio-dome. If you come here enough, you can definitely feel at home in this place and the wait staff will quickly become your friends. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We enjoyed a great night at Crave! They had a pre-opening night, as their official opening is tonight. The place is very pretty with a clean, well designed, modern feel. Nice little outside seating area overlooking the beautiful downtown Sunmerlin mall landscape. Our bartender Chris was outstanding! His Cosmos are made just right with a hint of a blush, not too much. We decided to call them Christini's as they are done so perfectly, grouping them in with run of the mill Cosmos seems wrong. Lol. We requested our favorite Alien Tequila, & hopefully they will have it very soon. The staff and servers were very nice & doing their best to give 5 star service.... getting everything out on time. The food all tasted great... Medium rare came out perfectly for both the burger and the steak. The chicken was moist and tasty. The pork tenderloin was very nice and Sea Bass was excellent. Asian noodles were Flavorful & not too hot. The Geisha-boat is a large Sushi boat and is stunning & the portion is very generous. The sushi is a little spicy, but in a good way. Deserts were Amazing! The chocolate cake is not a sweet milk chocolate... It is a dark chocolate lovers desert. Tiramisu is Fabulous!! Those two deserts were the highlights with our group. The General Manager, Ryun Chastain was very nice... He has an impressive resume, including s long stint at Wolfgang Puck & he is very observant & service oriented. He came over to chat & check on everything. Great New Reataurant with an upbeat vibe & really nice quality food. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Worst Pizza Hut ever. I have ordered from them a handful of times (mainly because they are literally 1 minute from my house). Every. Single. Time I order, they are WAY (15-20 minutes) past the quoted time, and they always tell me that ""the driver went on a double, and that my order left 15 minutes ago"". So, I'm literally waiting for my pizza knowing it isn't fresh. I have canceled my order on several occasions because I am not paying for cold food. I will never order from here again. I will be sticking to Rosatis down the street, better quality of food, better staff, and they deliver your food BEFORE the quotes time. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I'm feeling extra nice today, so Honey Bears gets 3 stars instead of 2. We were really hungry after work and couldn't decide on a place, but since we drive down Central and see this place everyday, we figured now was as good a time as ever to give it a shot. My first sight upon entering was a couple hookers sittin and eatin bbq. I wasn't sure if that was a good sign or a bad sign, but they were definitely hookers. Anyway, I stared up at the menu for about 30 seconds (it's pretty small) and decided on a regular bbq beef sandwich and a side of cole slaw. For two sandwiches and two sides the total came to about 14 bucks. Not bad! They also have RC cola in their soda fountain, so that may tickle your fancy. Not mine. The food came out in a matter of 2 minutes and we unwrapped our foil covered sandwiches to find... not enough bbq sauce. They charge extra. LAME! The meat was fine, but a little too dry for my taste. It was pretty good when it had some of the sauce on it. The cole slaw was okay, better than most places, except it was over peppered to me, but definitely still tasty. I probably won't go back here, as nothing really stood out to me, but it was good enough for a 20 minute meal. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Pei Wei is one of my very favs but lately it has been losing it's appeal and quality. I ordered egg rolls which taste was impossible to identify. The fried rice with beef tasted like burned oil.

 For under $8 (in South Park, that's nothing), I was served two eggs, two potato pancakes, three pancakes and three turkey sausage links. I went for lunch on election day 2010 and though the place was packed, our party of two was seated immediately. The eggs were decent; nothing special. The potato pancakes were pretty good, but not the best I've had. The turkey sausage and pancakes, on the other hand, were the best I've had in Charlotte. In my experience, turkey sausage is just something that restaurants keep on hand to please their selective customers (again, this is South Park we're talking about), but I actually feel like the Original Pancake House cared about the quality of even their more obscure ingredients. As for the pancakes, they were simply the best I've had, which says a lot considering I'm not a huge fan of pancakes in general. This filling lunch was well worth my $8. The best breakfast restaurant I've been to around the Quail Commons area where I work. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I would give 3 1/2 if that was an option.... Ok, this place has all the right elements. It has all the potential in the world! It is dimly lit, rustic/old-world decor, intimate, live music, extensive wine list, neighborhood gem, etc. It sounds perfect, right? Well, all of those things are the pluses. But I am not only looking for the atmosphere...I am all about the food..... I would say the food was OK. It wasn't amazing and it wasn't puke-worthy. The bread was fresh and had crunchy crust, which is always a good thing in my book. I loved the canneneli bean dip they serve as well. It was very tasty. I ordered the pasta fagiole and a salad, the rest of my dining partners ordered chicken parm. My salad and soup were just okay. The soup could have easily been out of a can but it wasn't bad. The chicken parm was okay as well. The pasta it is served with is very light on sauce and the little that was on there tasted like chef boyardee. I wanted a past a dish but I honestly didn't see one on the menu that looked worth the $20 they were charging. I mean, even the Penne Vodka was $16. I was told it was very salty so I didn't risk it. All the other pasta dishes had too much going on...shrimp and sausage and mussels, etc. I just wanted a good old fashioned pasta dish or even one that was served with marinara but that was nowhere to be found. We didn't try the desserts but they looked good! However, we were told by our waitress that the canoli cream was not made in-house. I am doubting that very much was made in-house. Overall, it was just an okay evening. The service wasn't spectacular, the food was mediocre and the prices don't seem necessary. However, the gentleman singing and playing the guitar was awesome. His voice was soothing and he was extremely talented. IF I came back it wouldn't be for dinner. Maybe some wine and appetizers while soaking in the tunes of what sounded like James Taylor! :) ",0,0,1,0,0

 ** NOTE TO YELP -- Change the name so people know to distinguish reviews for the old Fleur de Lys vs. the new Fleur. Definitely NOT the same! ** What the F$#@?! Why mess with a good thing?!?! Fleur de Lys was one of my favorite Vegas restaurants. A gf and I came to Fleur expecting a similar experience with similar quality. Where to start? The decor is similar to Fleur de Lys except they removed the thick drapes which now means you're dining with a loud view of what's outside the restaurant. The wall of roses is gone. And they've put up a tacky painting of a big breasted blonde Barbie woman on the back wall. Distracting. Service was mediocre at best. There were only a few waiters (who never introduced themselves). Service at Fleur de Lys was a hundred times better. And of course, the food. We ordered 5 dishes, which included one entree. Lobster Mac and cheese (okay, but nothing like what amazing taste you'd expect with the combo). Manchego salad (really arugula but where's the manchego??). Chicken croquettes (tasteless, almost like fish sticks). Skirt steak with chimichurri (bland, my husband makes better chimichurri!). Branzino with a chorizo risotto (risotto was okay, but Wynn buffet's risotto was better). HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT for $60/person. Even worse, both of our stomachs were quite unhappy for the remainder of the evening (and you're talking about two Asian girls that usually indulge our stomachs eating any- and everything without difficulty!).

 Whenever I get to Phoenix, I always stop by for some bread. I went there at 10:20 am to pick up some fresh bread. The young girl behind the counter told me they weren't open until 11. I told her I just wanted some bread, it was siting right there. She again told me no. I asked for the manager. A young female manager came out and basically told me that she couldn't sell me the bread. I asked her if was against the law or something and then she said the ""drawer"" wasn't out yet. I explained again that I just wanted some bread, not a sandwich or anything else. She again told me no. Obviously this woman manager and the counter girl should not be employed in a retail/sales environment. And, since they obviously don't need or want my money I won't be back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Great store with a huge selection but you have to really watch it to make sure you are getting a good deal. The price tags with the ""original"" prices don't seem to be on the level. My recommendation is to shop the real store or online to get an idea of how much you'll pay for what you want and then go to the outlet and compare to similar item to see if you can get it cheaper (and watch out for the high pressure upsell). You won't find the exact same merchandise but I was surprised to see the latest colors and prints there... I had been expecting it to be all last seasons stuff. Unfortunately this leads me to believe that a lot of what they sell there must be made specifically for the outlet. I guess time will tell if its the same quality or not. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We were staying at the hotel and heard about this place. Took a bit of looking but we were rewarded at the end of the long hallway lined in old album covers. Honestly this was a great slice of pizza. The crust stood up and did not get saturated with all the toppings. Had a piece of pepperoni and a slice of vegetarian. The peppers and tomatoes on the veggie slice were wonderful loaded with flavor. If you want a cheap, fast, quality eat come here for a slice. I will definitely go back. Staff was friendly and quick.

 I have lived in the area of Page's Dairy Mart for about 40 yrs. I have always enjoyed the ice cream until"" this"" day. I ordered an artic swirl (chocolate ice cream with chocolate chip cookie dough) I have ordered this same item over and over again. When I took first taste, no chocolate chip cookie dough pieces, second taste, same thing, third taste, same thing and so on for approximately 5 or 6 tastes. I took the cup with remaining up to counter and asked them to remake, I was denied told it would waste ""their"" money, nothing about mine, what I had ordered was more expensive than plain chocolate ice cream. They dumped what was in the medium cup into a small and handed back to me. Well it wasn't even a medium desert, since it fit into a small cup. I even tipped the girl $2 when I first received my desert. I will never return, to make any other purchases. I will however return to express my disdain to the owner when I can find him there.

 Stayed here on a Sunday night when me and my guy were bored and decided to drive to Vegas. $43 for the night... The room had a living room/dining room, kitchenette, separate bedroom and a big bathroom. And 3 tvs. But it was a smoking room so the whole placed smelled like cigarettes. We called to ask to get switched to a non smoking room when the lady at the front desk says she had upgraded us to a SUITE since nothing else was available.... Suddenly, the smell of cigarettes wasnt so bad...nothing an open window and a fan couldn't fix.. Don't expect to party here. Unless your idea of partying is slot machines and TGI Fridays. You can walk your drunk ass right across the street to the Palms. Or you can stumble to the Rio, which is right next door. Looks like they had shuttles to go to other casinos but I partied at the Palms so I didn't take advantage of that. By the way, there is a 3 dollar charge once you check in at the hotel. I booked online so when I got there I paid 3 bucks. Not a big deal but if you're like me, I like to know where every single one of my dollars goes when I'm in Vegas. It's a good deal to stay here if you'd rather spend your money on 20 shots at the bar and a nice buffet the next day. If you're looking for glamour, stay at the Bellagio. If you can afford it. But this place isn't bad at all. Besides, who really sits in their hotel room when they're in Vegas??? ",0,0,1,0,0

 I loved this place. The food was excellent and the service was great. I went there with my wife and mother and 3 kids. It was the day after Mother's day since my dear wife had to work on Mother's day. We loved pretty much every thing that we ordered. Now like all the all you can eat places in Vegas you can order sashimi but only as sushi and they make you eat everything. Still at 25 dollars a person and 20 for kids it was well worth what we paid. If there was one negative it was that at such a small place they still added 18% gratuity onto the bill. I would have tipped much more than that if they didn't add it. We really loved the Lobster Fair and the Las Vegas Roll. Especially the Las Vegas since it didn't have any rice. I do think that the staff needs better training. Although they were sweet and charming they did mess up a couple of times on the order. But we did order a lot and there were at least 3 people ordering. I guess I wouldn't have done as well as they did. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I'd recommend the pre fixe menu here, which was $69 for a three course meal. For the appetizer, we got to try the hot rocks, where you cook thinly sliced sirloin on a hot rock at your table. It was delicious and entertaining. I had one of their steaks for the main course. It was nothing too memorable. The highlight was dessert where they basically give you a sampler of 4-5 of their desserts. My favorite was the jelly doughnut holes. And I ordered a side of adult tater tots, after reading all the good reviews on them. I was rather disappointed...not sure what the big deal is. Just tator tots stuffed with cheese and bacon. Maybe it was because the tator tots weren't cooked very well, it was rather dry, it would've tasted better if it were cooked a little longer and with a little more oil to give it more of a crunch.

 Stayed in room 21641; the elevator took forever to take us up to that level but that's expected of hotels in Vegas. The decor was nice and clean. The view was boring....nothing too spectacular.

Called for breakfast at 5 am and got it in 20 min. It cost around $35 for a latte and a plate of eggs, potatoes, Ham and a tomato. It was pretty good and made me super full.

 We stopped here for dinner right before the show Le Reve. It was a bad choice. It's the worst buffet we've tried in Vegas. The selection of food is limited considering the price. The Asian food is horrible, Sushi rolls are not good, and the crab leg stand smells like a bad fish-market and looks like one too. There is big chucks of sea salt in every bite of the Spanish (or Mexican) tomato rice. Not much choice of fruits and deserts. Very disappointing dining experience. I gave one star just for the decor.

 I have to give credit to the Manager and our Waiter before i start talking smack. They did a wonderful job at easing our troubles that we had with the hostess. This was my first time there, I was with my partner on a tuesday afternoon and it wasnt very busy. We asked for a booth, we followed her and she then tried to sit us at this half table, half booth thing. If they were busy and this was the only table that would have been fine but there was plenty of other 2 sided booths available. When we asked her if we could sit at another booth, She gave this big sigh and said follow me. Now normally they hostess would take you to another booth and then go back to the front to fix the seating chart. But not her, she made us follow her back up to the front and then back out into the dining area and sat us. The whole time mind you copping attitude at us. So within the first 20 seconds we had experienced this bs. We let our waiter know the situation, he let the Manager know and he quickly came to our aid. Was very appolgetic and comped our appetizer. So we are enjoying our food which was extremely good. Mmmmm. and we see the manager and the hostess go into the back. 10min later we see her storm throught the restaurant and then see her walk out into the parking lot. He sent that B*tch home!!!! I was amazed....never had that happen before. Right before we were about to leave he gave us a 10$ gift card to come back.....booyah ",0,1,0,0,0

My bestie and I have even dubbed this our annual ""birthday spa"" place! Minus 1 star for rarely listening to my request to leave my nails longer (shaped, not cut down).

 I always order the same thing at Baidu, so take that into account with this review. But my usual order is delicious, and just as importantly for a Chinese restaurant, consistent. Their scallion pancake is a stellar appetizer, a Szechwan specialty that can be challenging to find in Vegas. Thin pastry layers have green onion flattened in between them. It's maybe more of a frybread texture than a flapjack. It's served with a soy ginger dipping sauce that's best used sparingly. Pork fried rice is my favorite Chinese dish. I know that's not very adventurous, but I don't care. Good pork fried rice is one of life's simple pleasures. Baidu's is, for starters, served in portions that strain the sides and top of the to-go cartons. The pork is mostly lean and a rich red color from the BBQ treatment. The vegetables are cooked to tenderness, like in a pilaf. The rice is just the right mix of fried and moist, with enough seasoning that you don't need to add soy, I find it well complemented by the searing hot mustard available on request. My new go-to for Chinese. ",0,0,0,1,0

 4.45 stars. I strolled into the Bradley Ogden lounge on a Monday evening, hungrily surveying the intimate space for quiet whispers and plush cushions to soothe my ringing ears and aching feet. Sliding into a chenille armchair the color of oatmeal, I felt my shoulders relinquish their vigilant posture, and sighed. Perusing the short, interesting menu, I opted for the famous Kobe and ribeye burger with frites and a peanut butter cup martini. The martini sidled up to my table a few moments later, flaunting a garnished rim of peanut butter and chocolate crumbs. This heady beauty swirled chocolate vodka, peanut rum, chocolate liqueur, cream, and simple syrup infused with peanut butter seductively in her glass, rendering a nicely layered drink with a rich, slightly earthy profile. She stayed with me through the meal, and promised to see me again. In due course, a gleaming burger, a tall cone of frites, a simple, luscious green salad, and sides of Dijon mustard and housemade mayonnaise requested a spot at my table. Never one to miss a new experience, I welcomed their company, particularly as the burger was lightly scented with red wine butter and smoke. Moist, rich, and beautifully pink, the burger dazzled my palate, its light touch of blue cheese perfectly complementing the light seasonings, its soft egg brioche roll a subtle cushion absorbing its juices. The frites were nicely browned and earthy, while the fluffy salad greens were dressed with a miso vinaigrette whose silky finish prepared my palate for the richness to come. An excellent meal. The service was relaxed, gorgeous, and engaging, the drinks were innovative, if occasionally touched with flakes of ice, and the lounge perfect for a quiet, casual dinner for couples or single travelers.

 Brace yourself, here comes a Chinese girl with a 3 star review! LOL :P @ Tetsuro!! Anyways, let me start off by saying that I haven't been to a gelato specialty store in ages. Truthfully, gelato has fallen off the trend ladder the past few years for my group. Now we're either getting fryo-yo or shaved ice. Now, don't count me out just yet. I am not biased at all. It's all about the taste to me. I had wanted to try Art of Flavors due to all the 5 star reviews. Speaking of which, I feel like I'm going to get jumped after this review HAHA! Anywho, my friends and I finally got to try out this place one Sunday afternoon. We were greeted by the site of a bunch of customers and a friendly face behind the counter. We never got his name but he was really friend. I think he was the husband? There were so many interesting flavors that I've never seen as gelato or ice cream. There was sweet corn, pear and gorgonzola, avocado, etc. We even got to try a majority of the flavors and I suppose that's where the magic ended for me. Oh no, it was fabulous and fantastic service that we got to try so many flavors. In fact, the man behind the counter was happy to oblige and started a conversation with us about the flavors. However, it just didn't captivate me. Regardless of all the interesting flavors and mixtures, it didn't get me. Everything tasted too milky and creamy. After every flavor I tried, minus the sorbets, the only thing I uttered after every flavor was ""milk"" ... cause that was all I tasted. There may have been subtle hints of what the gelato SHOULD taste like but not enough to make itself known. Was there something wrong with my taste palette? Maybe. You could argue that point I suppose. However, my friends agreed with me. Maybe I'm just used to stronger flavors? Maybe I can't do SUBTLE? Maybe I need it the flavors to PUNCH ME IN THE FACE? I don't' know. Though I will say, their sorbets are spectacular. The flavors were on point and tasted just like the real fruit. We tried the grapefruit and boy did it have the bitterness of the grapefruit. One of my friends and I ended up with a guava sorbet while my other friend got the avocado gelato. We haven't had the chance to try anything other than their gelato but honestly, I'm not too sure if we'll go back. A-okay in the end. Worth a try just to see all the different types of flavors.

 I would have to describe the vine as being, first and foremost, a filthy place. Dirty tables... some of them are broken and will fall over if you rest a pitcher on it. Some of the cushy seats inside have large gashes in them and their inside stuffing is bleeding out like entrails. The crowd is such an odd mixture of lowlives, well-dressed college kids, complete douche bags, metal kids, crusty kids, bros, middle aged boozers, hipsters and that one lady sitting at the end of the bar wearing a cocktail dress with a martini in her hand, a gun in her purse and a dark secret. That's what I really like about The Vine. It's a strange place, for sure. The bathroom has graffiti in such high-up places, someone either brought in a chair, stood on somebody's shoulders or had to balance one foot on the urinal and one on the sink in order to get into those awkward corners. On a few days out of the week, they have $1 you call its. The cover is $5 and you can go to town on cheap drinks. Granted, you don't get a full-ass glass of beer, you get a little plastic cup, but still it's still only a dollar. For dirt cheap, you can get wasted. It's a cool place to come in and wet your whistle, but I could never see being a regular. I like my dives dirty and I like my crowds strange, but The Vine just has something about it that strikes me as creepy. It really wouldn't surprise me if I found out that The Vine had been build on a piece of land where a family had been slaughtered over a hundred years ago. I don't think the place is haunted by ghosts, but it's definitely haunted by awkwardness. Whereas most dive bars sort of revel in their own filth, this place is sort of like you went over to your friend's house and found out that they have filthy, alcoholic parents that they're ashamed of. Check this place out. Friday nights can get poppin' off and you can expect to have a hangover the next day because with $1 drinks... come on. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have been here before and had this same experience. They like to only fill the cup up a little over halfway. So now every time I stop in there I have to watch them like a hawk and ask them to fill until it's almost to the top. My husband stopped to get soup for us today and I forgot to tell him, and when he came home he had a small chicken tortilla and it was only halfway full. He got charged full price. This is a big problem with this establishment. It's not what I would consider cheap food and yet they skimp anywhere they can. Tomato basil with orzo means you get about five pieces of orzo with your soup. Very unhappy with today's order. ",1,0,0,0,0

 One word. GROSS. I went there last night with my daughter, and we had a Groupon. It was the day before it expired, and I'm sure they had been inundated with them for the last 3 or 4 days. So of course when I told her I had a Groupon, the girl at the front counter was nice enough to roll her eyes at me, and of course I told her ""I see you roll your eyes at me"". So she told me because they had so many of these coupons. Great start. I got the sliders, a pork, a beef, and a chicken. My daughter got a bbq beef sandwich. For our sides we got macaroni and cheese and french fries. Megan's sandwich was wrapped in foil, and was barely warm, probably because the foil had kept in the the little amount of heat that there was. My sandwiches were cold, I mean cold to the touch, the meat and the buns, and they were not wrapped in foil. I took them up to the eye roller and told her to put them in the microwave for a minute, and she did. French fries were ok, a little salty. Mac and cheese was very good, at least there was that. The meat on the sandwiches was dry and tasteless. I brought a couple of them home and fed them to my dogs and cats. I had been to this Honey Bears a long time ago, and remember I didn't like it. Now I remember why, it was frankly, gross. Even with a coupon, seriously, I would never go back there. But if you do, say hi to the eye roller for me. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Without a doubt THE BEST Chinese food in Las Vegas. I've ordered Food from them 5 or 6 times and every time is phenomenal. The portions are huge, the prices are low and the food is absolutely fantastic.

 It's great when you stumble across a place you've never really noticed before. I've lost count of the amount of times I've walked along Bruntsfield Place, and I can't remember noticing A La Carte before. I was out this morning, and noticed their beautiful display of cakes. I love cake, and so going in here was a very easy decision! Entering the shop, you're surrounded by a plethora of different cakes and baked goods. It really is a feast for the eyes. I was wanting a snack, and got myself a couple of shortbread biscuits, spending a total of \ u00a31. I was greeted with a cheery smile from the server, which is always great. Like so many small shops, they clearly take great care with their customer service. I can foresee a lot of visits here to sample their range of cakes. According to their website, they also do outside catering, which if their shortbread is anything to go by would probably be very tasty. A La Carte - delicious home baking in the heart of Bruntsfield.

 We had dinner at Le Cirque last night, and let's start off by saying that the food was terrific. The service, well, that's a completely different story. To recount everything that went wrong would go on too long for anyone to bother to read. It started out with the two of us being seated squeezed between two tables such that I was bumped into a half dozen times by servers for the next table. We assumed that there was good reason for this initially, but after a while it was clear there was no good reason why they couldn't have seated us somewhere else. Then, no one came to even ask if we wanted something to drink before asking for our orders. We were looking forward to a nice meal, and we both decided to have the degustation menu with wine pairings. Without running through all six courses, there was at least one significant problem with each course: I was brought the wrong dish for one, my wife was brought the wrong wine for another, etc. And they could never seem to get the timing of the wine down, with respect to the food. We went from getting the wine for one course 20 minutes before the food arrived to getting the food before the wine got there at all for the next. Even when they began to sense that we were getting irritated, it seemed that they were too hopelessly disorganized to be able to get to correct the situation. It would be nice to able to experience the food at Le Cirque under better circumstances, but I can't imagine going back there any time soon, and I certainly could not recommend it to anyone else. Addendum: To their credit, the GM of Le Cirque contacted me to apologize for the bad experience and asked for the opportunity to make it up to us. No telling when we will be back in Vegas, though.

 Terrible experience. The great old place is now gone. People were turning around and walking right back out the door while we were scratching our heads trying to figure out the wall sized menu which is massively confusing not to mention the idiotic set up and hoops you have to jump thru just to get your meal. Now I wish we'd left too and went over to one of the other eating places in the lot By the time my daughter and granddaughter got their food My soup was cold from waiting for them it took so long. SO if you are on a lunch break forget it. You will not have enough time to eat if you get anything beside the salad bowl and cup of soup And now for $6.99 you get only a cup of soup period , a non refillable salad and bread and a frozen yogurt cup. The ranch dressing has also been watered and is now flavorless Well I don't eat the bread or yogurt there. So I didn't end up with any variety and that was boring too. Everything else is extra and they give you this stupid credit card thing they swipe at each station and you pay on the way out. If you lose the card they charge you $50.00 and you need a card for each person over the age of 4. There was also an additional $1.50 SERVICE CHARGE tacked onto the bill as well. Seeing that we served ourselves I have no clue what that was. Too bad we left as much of a tip as we did since we were charged extra. The mushroom soup that use to be great was an awful gummy mess and I actually got sick with terrible cramps about a half hour after eating and had to go running around looking for a bathroom while still on the road and afraid I would not make it to a bathroom in time. I have never gotten sick on their food before The girls has the rotisserie chicken with the mashed potatoes. The potatoes were awful and bland and the chicken was way too salty and they left 3/4 of the food on their plates it was so bad. I understand the chicken soup is no longer good either. People around us were also grumbling with dissatisfaction over the change The only good thing I can say is they did spruce it up inside. But I'm not there for just the decor If they have sense they will go back to the way it was. I'd be willing to pay a higer price if it was the same. After 6 years of eating there at least twice a month, we will not be going back. It's 4 hours and a dose of Pepto later and I still feel ill as I write this ",1,0,0,0,0

 So I'm bias, Sergio is not only a mentor he is a Master of Jiu Jitsu as well! I could stop at mentioning his 37 yrs as a black belt and the countless number of great Jiu Jitsu and MMA fighters he's molded or shown the true meaning of pressure! Sergio's school is no joke! Everyone greats you with a smile and everyone is welcomed as a member of the family. He is without a doubt royalty in the would of Jitz! Now he doesn't get as much press as the Graces do but don't underestimate his influence here in the US! I recall when I first joined, one day I counted 11 black belts present in class! All the guys from whiteto black are top notch! I can say I trained with most of the big names in Vegas, guess if you rolled all of them together maybe they would have Sergio's level of experience! If your in Vegas and your at the beginning your journey, or if you've been around the block come, by the Spring Mountain location you won't regret! If your already in town and sick of training with a guy with a giant ego, or a part time teacher and a full time fighter?! You owe it to learn from the root of modern Jiu Jitsu! Again I'm bias, and I currently live in NYC and train with another legend, in Marcello. They are really one in the same, very confident, humble and masters of the art of grappling warfare!

 My review for this restaurant is really a 2.5 stars. 4 Stars for the service. 3 Stars for the Classic Bruchetta appetizer. Less than 2 Stars for the entrees. The dishes that we had were: Butternut Squash Ravioli - Sweeter than it should taste and not memorable overall. Seafood Risotto - Very few pieces of seafood. Risotto was over cooked and mushy. I picked out the shrimp and calamari, ate 2 spoons of the Risotto, and left the rest on the plate. Spaghetti and meatballs - the meatballs were well flavored with fresh basil but the spaghetti was way undercooked. Pretty mediocre meals for the price. I would rather eat at Miro Spanish Grille or at Maggiano's than come back here. The ambience here is very low key and more of a neighborhood restaurant and seemed to be mostly elderly. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Here's the deal: I actually love Coffee, Bean & Tea Leaf. I even love this location and have made it my office for the day more times than I can count in the last year. There is a problem, however. A big one. When ordering my large beverage at Coffee, Bean & Not Very Nice, I have accidentally said ""venti"" on two different occasions. Two times in what has to be over 52 visits. I know, I know. A serious coffee faux pas. I apologized when I realized my blunder, but was not anticipating the rude reception I received. Twice. Hey, I get it. You don't want to be confused with Starbucks. Starbucks is the quarterback and Coffee Bean is the art student. Here's the problem, though, I'm just the nerdy girl that plays saxophone in the pep band who wants her damned coffee and a little kindness. Yes, I go to Sbux, but I go everywhere else, too. I'm from the capitol of coffee, Seattle, and just want my drink to be good and my service to be friendly. If this had just happened once, I'd let it go, but twice? Sorry, folks, but you can keep your venti, large what-have-you and I'll head down the street to Starbucks. Thanks. At the end of the day, and it hurts a little to write this, it's just coffee.

 Disappointing. First and foremost the service was extremely poor. We were never asked if we wanted a refill and our glasses sat empty since before the food came out. The table that sat down and ordered 10 minutes after we sat down and ordered had their 4-5 dishes come out long before our 2 dishes. We had Mongolian Beef and Steamed Pork & Salted Fish. The Mongolian Beef was pretty tasteless and came out 10 minutes before the pork. The pork tasted just like spam. The best part of meal was the spring rolls and they were probably frozen from a factory. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Came here for an early dinner for six of us and was able to catch the end of happy hour. We ended up just ordering 2 of every tapa on the happy hour menu so that each person got to try one of each. Didn't even really bother to look at the menu as I think all of us were too lazy to pick out what we didn't want :P We also got a paella along with 4 pitchers of sangria (part of the happy hour menu) which may have been overly ambitious :D 2 pitchers of red and 2 pitchers of white. We were struggling to finish all the alcohol. For the most part, everything was excellent, I just wasn't too big of a fan of the stuffed date (not too into sweets in general). I don't remember all the food we got but some of the items included: potatoes bravas, meatballs, chicken croquettes, calamari, and chorizo. With the happy hour prices, our bill actually came out to less than what we were anticipating which made it a pretty good value for a fancier meal with copious amounts of alcohol. ",0,0,0,1,0

 These guys are great, they came out to my house on the west side, showed up on time, and were very professional. I think our technician's name was Michael. He quickly diagnosed the problem with the AC unit, and the cost to fix it was much less then we expected. We had used another AC Repair service a few months earlier, they had charged us double to fix the same problem on our other AC unit (we have 2). Michael also gave me tips on how to maintain my AC system in summer and winter, which filters to use, etc... If you have any HVAC issues, call these guys! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've been to koi many times in NY so was anxious to try this one. Had reservation. Restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived and we were seated promptly. Server was nice but all recommendations were the highest priced items on the menu. Inguess he thought we were ""tourists."". The crispy rice with tuna is written @ in every online review as the greatest and he didn't recommend it. So fair rating on service. Food on other hand was delicious as in NY. The warm spinach and mushroom salad was good. Should have been a little warmer but good flavor. Crispy rice with tuna was spectacular and I always order this. Rock shrimp tempura was right amount of spicy and delicious served with endive. Next some rolls - yellowtail and an eel. Both were good, fresh but nothing outstanding. Finished with mochi dessert. Good light dessert. 3 mochi filled with ice cream - choco, green tea and mango. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Always great music, although the techno/electronic dj inside was a little slow on varying the beats, became too hypnotic (this is not a rave). Need to vary to get people going. The outside hiphop, with all the suburban 'college' crowd TRYING to bop with 'urban flava' and hold on to their beers at the same time. Went for the first time on a Thursday. Slow to generate a crowd. Interesting dynamic. More people interested in 'hooking up' than dancing. Mixed age crowd, with a large wedding party celebrating. Not a bad time, but glad I get in free as a local lady. Great looking club, amazing view of the strip. Better on Fri. and Sat. evenings. Go for the view or with a fun, loud group. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The Breadfruit is a staple restaurant for my girlfriend and I. We're usually in here once a month or so. It's a small, quiet restaurant tucked into downtown. While small, it's nicely decorated with rotating local artists' work displayed on the walls. Service is always very friendly and usually pretty quick. The entres are all generally pretty first rate. Though I usually get the curried chicken, the brown stew chicken and jerk chicken are both excellent choices. On the vegetarian side of things, the pop cho with ginger is amazing. I love the sweet potato mash with garlic - unfortunately it wasn't on the menu the last time I was there - not sure if it'll be making a return or not. Personally I like spicy food - so I've never had any issue with it being overly hot. In terms of consistency it's always fresh and excellent - one of the more consistent restaurants in this regard. Most of the entrees are in the $10 range - which I think is very reasonable. If I was going to nitpick at anything it'd be the appetizers - not the quality which is generally very good (the festivals with the nice mango chutney are usually our pick) - but the pricing. With shrimp and scallop appetizers being more expensive than most the entrees it just seems odd - though I'm sure getting quality, fresh seafood in Phoenix probably isn't cheap. *EDIT* - Breadfruit now has a liquor license and is no longer BYOB - bummer. Also, their specials tend to be significantly pricier than most their menu items (like double average entree cost) but they don't go out of their to mention this - so be sure to ask pricing on the specials.

 Received a killer deal for a 4 day/3 night stay at Encore. Turned out to be ~$116/night package that included a Wynn buffet for two for 3 days and two tickets to Le R \ u00eave. Hey that's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick any day in my book! Dang SWEET right?! I'm saving a lot of money by coming here right?! They don't call it Lost Wages for nothing right?! Spent two days playing craps at the Encore Casino. I wasn't even planning on playing there, but their Craps tables stuck with the $10 minimum all weekend long. I thought for sure they would raise it to a $25 min, but no such luck. So I couldn't resist and to my detriment, I lost big time. I did have a 20+ roll streak and won some of it back. Drank a lot of ""free"" Bloody Mary's and Dirty Martini's. But no matter how you look at it, Encore/Wynn got their money's worth outta me. Even though I didn't end up with a roll of 100's in my pocket, I did not leave this place disappointed. (I did end up having enough to buy a Ho Dduk the next time I'm at Koo's ;P) The rooms were awesome; roomy suites (requested more shoe polish and they gave me 10 cans of it!), huge spa-like bathrooms accommodated with robes, slippers, and a flat-screen TV. Also for your viewing pleasure, awesome views of the entire strip or downtown LV. Part of the deal included free Wi-Fi, and use of the fitness club; a very sweet setup with a juice bar, cold and room-temp bottled water, headphones, and ample sweat towels. When staying at the Encore/Wynn, you also have access to their ""European"" outdoor pool where Steve Wynn proudly states that you are free to go topless if desired. So we went and indeed, there were many uninhibited women who were ""propped up"" and indeed topless. More power to them. Caba \ u00f1as can be rented on a per/day basis. I wish we came to LV to experience more places to eat, but with my losing streak and money leaving my wallet left and right, we ended up eating at the ""free"" buffet for either lunch or dinner all three days... AND YES, I AM SO SICK OF THE WYNN BUFFET. Even though we earned another free buffet for two the next time we go, I don't think I'll want to spend any more time there. The one great thing was the wait service. The waiters we had were all very nice, cordial, and attentative. As far as the buffet was concerned nothing to write home about. I think I did eat about 10 cr \ u00e8me brulees as that was all that was memorable. Le R \ u00eave was a watery enigma of a story about a lost lover who is shown a world of the underground, ravaged with temptation, and is always being pulled back and forth until the end. At least that's my take on it. But a great production none the less. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This has to be one of the worst run businesses I have ever seen. Due only to proximity to my home, I have attempted to accomplish a few seemingly simple post office errands on multiple occasions, and the incompetency of ALL staff and services provided never ceases to prevail. **Passport Photo and application for our 3 month old baby- Attendant says ""We need you to make copies of these documents and come back before we can complete photo and application... But we have no copy machine. Make copy and come back"" (I then leave with baby to make copies elsewhere and return, wait in line again only to hear)- ""Let me see if someone can do the photo..."" (Lady asks staff loudly)- ""Who can do the passport photo?"" (Silence from staff. She struggles to get an answer out of one staff member who says)- "" we don't have the white sheet"" (even though there is blank white wall in the photo area to utilize and I am perfectly capable of holding up my baby for it go the face shot where my arms won't show). She finally says ""just go to walgreens and get a photo and come back"". Needless to say I didn't return to complete the process at this location. **Example 2: Mailing a package and letter using Priority Service- as I look around for mailing labels and packages, they are of course out of priority labels and every type of package other than the largest size. I settle for using my own envelope which I was hoping to deliver in pristine condition and go to the self service area to print a paid mailing label which I can them write an address on. Looking around for a pen, which of course there are none (even for sale), The staff points to a pen refill with no case on it, that was placed in one of 6 different empty pen holders. I grab the tiny refill and try to write on the label, and the leaky refill gets ink all over my hand. I ask for a paper towel or tissue and of course no one knows anything about where to find one. One staff member tells me to ask the mail room person, but that person is of course not around at the moment. This all may sound like a comedy act but I'm sorry to say that it's the actual experience you are likely to receive at this post office location. There were more horrifying details regarding staff attitudes I witnessed, including towards other customers, but in order to avoid writing a book, I gave only the baseline review. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I wish I could give them 0 stars. Worst service I have ever had. I'm so glad I didn't give this dump any of my money. Where to begin: My girlfriend and I wanted Mexican food so we go on yelp and decide on this place. There are no hours of operation on yelp for this restaurant so I call the phone number to ask when they close. The phone rings 10 times, no one answers, I hang up. I call again about a minute later, the phone rings 4 times and a woman picks up and speaks Spanish. I ask her ""what time do you guys close?"" She speaks Spanish back to me. Now I understand this is a Mexican restaurant but the woman answering the phone should be bi-lingual and be able to speak English. BUT, my girlfriend speaks Spanish so I hand the phone to her and she asks in Spanish what time do they close. The woman apparently couldn't hear my girlfriend (over the blaring music in the restaurant) so my girlfriend asks 3 more times...every time the waitress didn't understand her so the waitress hangs up. My girlfriend calls back and asks again and finally the waitress understands. We head to the restaurant and the music is blaring we can hear it outside. Now I have been to Mexican restaurants before with live-bands and I enjoy it very much but this was a bit ridiculous. They had not only a live band playing but they had three huge loud speakers that the live music was blaring out of. I am not one to exaggerate and when I say I couldn't hear myself talk, I literally mean I could not hear myself talk. I couldn't understand my girlfriend and she was two feet away from me. We walk up to the front counter and there is a girl behind the counter typing away at the computer. Doesn't acknowledge us, doesn't look up, doesn't say hi. Just keeps typing away at the computer. We wait there for about 45 seconds and another waitress walks up to us and points to a table in the back. She doesn't walk us to the table just stays behind the counter and points to the table. We walk through the restaurant to the back and notice that every single empty table is messy (food scraps, plates, glasses) no empty table is clean. We get to the table she pointed out for us and sure enough it has food scraps and chip crumbs on it. We sit down and I take a napkin and wipe away the food crumbs. The waitress comes over to us, does not say hello. Just hands us two menus, cleans up the food crumbs and walks away. Didn't smile, no hello how are you. She didn't even ask us what we wanted to drink. Just walked away. My girlfriend and I sat there for about two more minutes and decided we were going to get the hell out of there and we did. We got up and walked out. Terrible experience. Terrible service. ",1,0,0,0,0

 AMAZING! I absolutely LOVED the movie, but this show is on a whole different level. What made the experience better was we got really good seat! on Vegas.com they have a free seat upgrade deal which I highly recommend you take advantage of. The talent of every performer was amazing, from the leads to the supporting cast. The stage technology was also VERY impressive. I have somewhat of a theatre background and to see what they accomplish during the show through moveable sets and props is just crazy. The adaptation from a cartoon film to live theatre couldn't have been better. I think the only thing that bothered me was the additional songs that weren't originally from the movie.....maybe I'm a little bit biased for those good ol' disney songs but they just didn't have that special disney-ness to them.

 Stopped by for happy hour. Odd, because it took the better of an unhappy hour to be waited on. Bartender, nice guy, kept telling me he was jammed, but the whole place was less than 1/4 full. Finally got to order (Happy hour specials, apps and since drinks $5. I orderef 1/2 order of naked wings and a glass of the house cab). Took forever to arrive. Wings nice and crispy, but when they say naked, they mean it. No salt, no pepper, almost no flavor. House wine wasn't something I'd order ever again. Not that I'm coming back here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Been to: Boiling crab in OC Kickin crab in OC Angry crab in Mesa I'll compare this to Angry crab because let's be honest we really can't compare food from Az to Cali. Seasoning: in comparison to Angry Crab, it has more of a Cajun flavor. Less butter and garlic. Spice level: it's ONE step higher in spicy level. For example: angry crabs 5 is a 4 at hot and spicy. Sides- Sausage: angry crab = 4 large pieces for 75CENTS!! (Steal) Hot and spicy = 6 small pieces for $2.75!! (Def not worth it) Crawfish- Angry crab: small Hot and juicy: prob double the size and juicier. (Def worth it) Shrimp- Same size. Service- I understand Hot and Juicy has been open for less than a month and they're still working out their kinks... But there's no reason every single employee needs to rotate every 5 minutes to ask if everything is okay. Never asked us if we wanted lemons/limes and salt/pepper like most other places. Didn't offer to place the bibs on like other places as well (not that I need it but hey, it's a nice gesture) :) I'm giving it 3 stars and hope to give it more once they figure out the kinks. Will def come back because the flavor is there. A bit pricier than most, but still worth going. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The staff at the station itself is very friendly and accommodating. I came here with Don because we won admission to a show they were having inside the studio and while we were waiting for them to let us into the studio, they gave us all some free movie screening passes. Then we were all escorted into a conference room to wait a while longer because they were taking a while to setup. We were only waiting about 10 minutes before they decided to order boxes of pizza and liters of soda for us all to grub on as a means of apologizing for the wait. I've waited waay longer at different places without even getting a single apology. It was very generous of them. Once they were all setup and ready, we were lead into another room with a bunch of chairs and a big space in the front which doubled as the stage. The show was amazing and all the instruments and sound equipment they had seemed to be top notch. When it was all over, all the guests, the staff, and the musicians were all grouped together for a picture. We had a blast! ",0,0,0,1,0

 We decide to eat at Red Robin tonight because of the heat. We made use of the free appetizer offer I received via my red royalty card. We got a double sampler of onion rings and cheese sticks. I have to say that I've had better onion rings at iHop. The rings were medium sized. They were coated with a very crunchy breaded batter that I didn't care for. My wife thought the cheese sticks were fine. My wife ordered the cluckers and fries and I had a crybaby burger. The crybaby burger was strange in that the ghost sauce had an odd taste to it. The waiitress told me it was because of the burger being layered with two kinds of onions but I could definitely taste something off in the sauce. Anyhow the burger was good & I was hungry so it was a winning combination. ",0,0,0,1,0

 During a weekend trip to Vegas, some friends and I decided that the ""Hey, how often are you in Vegas?"" mentality, which is, as you can maybe imagine, unbelievably dangerous. The result? ENVY Steakhouse. Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere? While by Vegas standards this may be standard (comparable to some of the restaurants in the popular hotels), ENVY is without a doubt very, very nice. The atmosphere is elegant, and our server was absolutely brilliant. Not only did he know everything about the menu, but he was brilliantly helpful pointing us in the direction of the evening's festivities. To top it all off, our orders were all perfect (party of six) and service was prompt. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost? This is always tricky with nicer restaurants since you're obviously paying for the experience, but even taking that into consideration, I can't quite justify the $36 that I paid for ENVY's Shellfish Stew: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vIZ9bM2Z2MSTY0U4ZGDbNQ&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg When it comes down to it, I'm looking at about six shrimp, half of a potato, five clams and at most two crab legs. $36? Sorry. No Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food? While lacking in the portion department, the quality of ENVY's food really is quite good. My Shellfish Stew was tasty, and the filet mignon that one of my friends got was nothing short of one of the best cuts of meat I've ever had. Dual Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could? Even if I were made of money, ENVY's somewhat limited menu, high prices and proximity from the Strip are enough to keep it from being a repeat evening out. No Star Granted. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I actually ate at this restaurant about 2 years and didn't care for it. I don't know why I agreed to go back again last week. For the prices they are charging, you can have a NICE dinner in Vegas elsewhere. The food here is very blah with a side of pretentiousness. It is super convenient if you're staying at Planet Hollywood though to pop in for a quick bite to eat. Ask for a table that has a view... it'll make the food taste better. ",0,1,0,0,0

 What is there not to LOVE about this Texas BBQ. First off, it is not misleading as it feels like a country store from when you first walk in. One of the best things about this place are the bbq smokers right behind the registers. You can watch them pull out the meats and cut it right there. Then they serve it by the 1/2lb. And will serve your BBQ on top of butcher paper. No fancy plates or bells and whistles. They know their BBQ will speak for itself. Seating is almost picnic style as there are just different picnic tables and chairs through out. Service is always outstanding and prices are more than reasonable. Definitely recommend coming here if your in the area and even worth the drive if your not. Also if they haven't sold out of Prime Rib definitely get some as it's one of the best around!! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've been going to Mr Sushi for the past 5 yrs. They are actually open for lunch on Saturdays. They have the best lunch specials and my favorite rolls i order are the Mexican and New York roll. Love their salad dressing and all the different appetizers. The only complaint i have about this place is that sometimes they will have a all you can eat night and of course on those nights the place gets packed. They do not seem to have enough staff to accommodate such a large number of customers on those nights. They need better planning on those nights. We must have waited at least 30 minutes just to order. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I think after tonight, this will be the last time I go to Richardson's. My husband likes the place, but I find it overpriced for the quality of food. However, I thought it would be nice to take him there tonight for his birthday. First, you can't make a reservation unless you have a party of four and as I discovered, there are no tables for two people. So when we got to the restaurant, there were no tables available and the bar was full, so we were offered a side bar area or outside sitting at a coffee table type area. Less than stellar choices for a birthday dinner. Finally, we got a couple seats at the bar. I ordered the Grouper with caper lemon butter sauce. Imagine my surprise when I received my dish and there were no capers. Everytime that I have had a caper sauce it has had capers in it. When I asked about it, they looked at me like I was crazy. Plus, all the sauce was absorbed by the tortilla on the plate. So I basically I paid $27 bucks for a dry Grouper with asparagus. My husband kind of liked his dish, but he was not overwhelmed. Yeah, the last time we will go there. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Great happy hour prices! My gf and I purchased a bottle of Malbec and the Bruschetta (which included four pieces). Our total came to $28, which is quite the bargain. The Bruschetta was not too hard--I hate when it's overly crispy--and we enjoyed the wine. Our waiter was super knowledgeable about the wines and friendly overall. We sat on the patio but the interior was nicely decorated and looked cozy. My only complaints: Snooty hostess and limited offering of happy hour food. You can only choose from Bruschetta and charcuterie. This place seems ideal for a small group or date night. Cheers. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Went there for lunch Friday. It was a pretty bad experience. When we walked up to the hostess stand, she immediately told us to wait a minute and walked off...When we were seated we waited at a long time for service (the restaurant was nearly empty). A waitress asked us if we had been waited on, and when we told her no, she said ""I wonder if they assigned me this table"" and walked off. We finally got a waitress. After we had our orders taken, we saw her putting out ketchup bottles, etc. on the tables before she even put our orders in or brought us drinks!!! The service didn't get any better, we waited a long time, and my food sucked. Kinda hard to criticize a cheeseburger and fries but I didn't finish them. I would have loved another napkin and had to finish my burger with my knife and fork because I couldn't wipe my hands. I didn't leave a tip for probably the second time in my life. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I guess I should update this since I have been here three times now. I was going to add a star to my review for the second visit until this third visit. (See review of third visit). The second experience was better for me. I ordered a pound of shrimp hot trifecta. I gotta say it was pretty good. Mine came over seasoned but it made it more better. I can't say the same for my friends..they ordered the same as I did but they all said it wasn't hot and spicy. In fact, they ask started to dip into my sauce and loved it more. Another had to send theirs back for being undercooked. For this third visit, third times a charm right? Wrong. This time I ordered the fried cat fish which at first I was grossly discussed by since mine came undercooked. Had them take it back and make a new one. Second one came out amazing but was missing the cole slaw and correct sauce it came with the first time, no biggie. The waitress even took it off our bill. The rest of the food was pretty good. My family ordered the Dungeness crab, shrimp, and clams each of those turned out good. Another note, after being opened for over 6 months now you would think they would get their choking timing down by now. Also they were surprisingly busy tonight. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Absolutely the worst restaurant in town, I cannot believe it is still in business. The place is so outdated; it looked like a scene from The Shining. All I could smell when I walked in the door was cigarette smoke. When I passed the salad bar it looked like none of the food had been changed in hours, maybe even days. When we were seated the first thing I noticed was a few dead flies in the window sill and about a quarter inch of dust on all the fake plants and the window sill. All the glassware and silverware were covered in smudges and fingerprints, which is one thing if you're eating at your local East Side's but at a restaurant where the average plate is $35.00-$40.00 or more I would expect clean cutlery and dishes at the very least. When the food came several of us had ordered the New York Striploin and yet no 2 plates looked the same. Some cuts of steak were thick and short, some were thin and long, they were all cooked rare even though they were all requested at different temperatures with one being well done. One of my fellow diners had to send her salmon back twice and it still wasn't cooked thoroughly so she gave up and ate the veggies, that quite frankly tasted frozen. When we told the waitress about the undercooked meals she seemed almost offended and was defensive about the issue and reluctant to take them back. Also I should say when the food was brought back to the kitchen it came back with the meat having been re-heated and the sides all cold. All in all I would say this restaurant was a terrible waste of money and if it weren't for the good company the evening would have been a write off too. I would not recommend going to Golf Steakhouse because it is significantly over priced and the food, d \ u00e9cor and atmosphere seem to have come out of a totally different era. ",1,0,0,0,0

 It's not possible to give negative stars or I would for O'Brien's. My sister recommended that my husband and I try buy a used car here because she purchased her Camry there. So we went and thought we were getting a good deal on a used 2004 Corolla LE Thursday, Sept. 18. We paid $3,000 down of our own money that day and filled out all of the papers--with the understanding that we could back out of the deal at any time--because the car was in need of some paint touch ups and total detailing because the car had just been traded in. We were promised the car Monday, Sept. 22. When we called Monday morning to talk to our car salesman we were told that we'd have to wait to pick up the car until right before closing because the ""carpets were still drying."" Instead we offered to pick up the car Tuesday morning to give them more time. After getting a ride out there Tuesday morning we arrived to ""bad news"" (according to our salesman). The car was not ready. The paint work that was supposed to have been completed was the wrong color--he even admitted it before we saw it. When we saw the car, we were not happy. Not only was the passenger side rear quarter panel painted the wrong color, but there was chipped paint around the fuel tank door that looked as if someone had touched it up with nail polish instead of being fixed as promised. Paint chips on the bumper were untouched. Our salesman told us that we would have the car Thursday morning and that we would love the car and it would be perfect. He was very apologetic and we understood that he was not at fault for the bad workmanship. Upset, we left hoping that we would be satisfied one week after purchasing the car. After some thought we decided to look around at a few other dealers, including Worden Martin because we realized it was uncalled for to wait one week for a car. At Worden Martin we found a 2007 Corolla LE and negotiated a price that was only $1300 more than the price we negotiated at O'Brien for the 2004 Corolla LE! We explained our situation to the salesman at Worden Martin and said that we'd return to buy the car that evening. We returned to O'Brien's where naturally our salesman tried to talk us out of canceling the deal. He couldn't understand why we didn't want to wait a week to pick up a car we had already made a deposit on after it being unacceptable. Finally, he agreed to give us the paperwork and our check back and cancel the transaction. However, it turns out that O'Brien's DEPOSITED OUR CHECK FOR $3,000!!! I see that one reviewer didn't put any money down and bought a car. I guess that's how they can afford to do it! They refunded the money for the stop payment we had to issue through our bank and we were all set. Or so we thought. The long story gets longer though. After a call today (Sept. 24) to my lender to confirm that O'Brien hadn't sent loan paperwork through they called back to inform me that O'Brien's HAD SENT LOAN PAPERWORK THROUGH FOR A CAR WE DIDN'T HAVE IN OUR POSSESSION! But they took our money and our loan anyway. I'm still trying to sort out the mess that O'Brien's created and hope that my credit score hasn't been affected. O'Brien's completely screwed us over at every opportunity. I realize they didn't mean to do this but how can you excuse taking people's money? Unfortunately they're the only Toyota dealer in town but hopefully we can find another dealer if we ever need parts or service. I certainly don't want to give them any money! Gayle Chaney at Worden Martin took great care of us and we drove out with a car in an hour or less. They were priced more competitively and were decent to negotiate with. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My first experience of Comme Ca was New Year's Eve 2010. From very attentive service to a wide variety of French bistro food this is a place for your must see list in Las Vegas. Located in the new Cosmopolitan next to CityCenter and Bellagio, Comme Ca also overlooks the Strip with incredible view points. Try the Turbo fish. Was told by the waiter this fish is indigenous to the waters of Northern France and the way it's prepared at Comme Ca will make you want to come back for more. Lobster salad to a variety of beets add to the amazing variety of dishes offered. For those desert fans, the creme brulee was outstanding. On our departure the Comme Ca manager asked about the service and food. You don't get that level of attention very often is restaurants. He was genuinely interested in our feedback and that experience was one more reason to make Comme Ca my restaurant of choice. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Well I had never had tex-mex before and I was very curious! This is my first experience eating brisket (I was told this is the best thing to order at a tex-mex place) and it was delicious! ....And there is a but....So I am a Northerner and I probably have this wrong so please forgive me....but am I allowed to compare brisket to bbq in the sense that good bbq usually does not have a lot of fat or grisel or bones? Is brisket supposed to have clumps of fat in it? If so - and if I am clueless, please forgive the reference to it and skip my review, but if you are the tiniest grossed out by big pieces of fat, dont get the brisket here. Ok fat conversation over. Other than that the brisket that I got in my tacos was very tender and delicious. Yet I was kind of wondering 'where is the rest?' I gave this place only two stars because the hard-shelled tacos I got had probably three good mouthfuls of brisket and no lettuce or other fillings in them so they pretty much came out 1/3 full for over ten bucks? (I ordered two tacos but I think you can order 1 or 2 or 3). No amount of dry Spanish rice on the plate could make up for it. The meal also came with your choice of beans which were very good. The pic posted shows the truth of portion size so judge for yourself. Service was excellent and they were constantly adding chips to the basket on the table. Sigh...in the end I couldnt get over the fat I had to pick through or that it cost so much for so little. I hope to try this place in a few weeks and add more stars. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Hmm, I would call this place average at best. Now mind it, it doesn't have to be awesome considering it is on the casino floor with high foot traffic. As we waited at the hostess stand, an employee came up and said she would be right with us. We proceeded to wait more than five minutes for her to come back, even though the restaurant was almost empty. When she did come back, we were seated right next to the casino floor. We asked if we could be moved to a table farther inside the restaurant to escape some of the noise and smoke. She claimed the servers could only service a small area. The tables were at most 10 feet away from each other. Doesn't make sense to me but whatever. Also, their menu switches over at 11 PM. We arrived right at 11, and the server seemed super confused about what menu we could order from (or if we could order from both). She told us at least three different stories and finally let us order from either the dinner menu or the late night menu. The food was good, but not great. Nothing terrible though. Good option if you are on the casino floor and in need of a quick bite any time of the day. The hash browns were AMAZING though! This is worth a star bump!

 First time in Las Vegas, so we decided to give this place a try since we're staying at Stratosphere. The calamari was sub-par, the bacon wrapped shrimp was only okay. Neither offered any taste. The ribs looked amazing but it was way too sweet to swallow. The seafood fettuccini was the worst! It was so fishy to the point that it was inedible. When we asked the waiter about it, he said that the dish is normally fishy like that, which would've been nice to know before we ordered it. The shrimp scampi was probably the best dish we ordered. However, it looked like a child's meal with 4 shrimp and barely a handful of rice. The salmon fillets still had bones inside, but other than that, taste was okay. Service was great, but that was about the only positive thing I can say about this restaurant. We should've taken the hint when there were only about 5 tables there when we walked in. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Horrible. I am a strict vegan. I ordered a latte with soy milk at the drive trying thru and drove off. Halfway to work & 6 sips in I realized something tastes off. I opened the cup to discover whipped cream at the top of my cup. I am enraged! Obviously if someone orders soy they are either vegan or lactose intolerant so adding whipped cream defeats the purpose & makes no sense. I called to complain & the manager offered to make me a new drink (too late, I was already at work for my 7am shift) or I could come back later for a free coffee voucher. No thanks, I dont want your mediocre coffee. Do yourself a favor and drive down the street to Sunrise Coffee on Sunset, east of Eastern. They have an amazing, competent staff, & the quality of their coffee is 100% better than Starbucks burnt coffee. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Who doesn't like sweets?! Once I found out about this new bakery I made a special trip over. Finding the pay $6 for $12 deal through Yelp made it that more enticing... Once inside the shop, I found it to be welcoming with a comfy seating area with a few table and chairs. The glass case was filled with fun looking pastries. They serve bagels, cheesecakes, eclairs, cookies, and cakes. They also have WiFi for the customers. Great location off of South Boulevard and across the street from the Scaleybark LYNX stop. I ordered some cookies ($6), bread ($8), and a couple of cheesecakes ($3.50 each). However, once I got them home, the cookies were hard (as if they were over baked) and the bread was dry. I quickly called them to see if they bake daily and I was told the bread is baked every Friday and supposedly the cookies are done daily, if not the night before. They also freeze their bread. The baker was very sweet, but asked if I tried rewarming the bread to freshen it up (not what I had in mind). However, she offered for me to return next week to get a fresh batch or to come back and pick out something else with store credit. Instead, I just wanted them to void my transaction and save myself the trip back...but to do so, they asked if I could return to get a refund...and so I did. I think there is a lot of potential in this cookie shop. Although, they could easily make a few changes to make for a better experience: 1. Train staff to be knowledgeable of everything. For a small shop, It is disjointed to hear the employees say, ""I am only the ____. I don't know about ____."" 2. Have prices on everything. I had no idea the bread was $8. 3. Don't ask for email addresses without saying what it is for and leave it as an option for customers to give. I felt pressured to give my personal email; I get enough ads, I like to be selective. 4. Make sure the product is of high quality, especially because of the prices they are charging. I think of Cake Boss...he checks what goes out and says, ""Each time something goes out, it has my name on it...it better be good."" Lastly, the owner and staff were not aware of the Yelp deal and I felt the confusion. While the owner and staff were nice, sadly, I had a disappointing experience. I really wanted to like this place.

 If your planning on visiting Vegas, it would be a shame to past this up. This was my first visit to a wax museum and I was thoroughly impressed. Me and my hubby had a great time. (check out the pics, I think he had a better time than I did) We had a great time taking pictures and clowning around. I see that some are upset about the $25 price for the entry fee. We picked up one of those Vegas books. They showcase food, shows and entertainment. Inside of the gems are coupons to the local events. We got a coupon out of there for $5 off each admission price. It took us a little over an hour to go through the entire museum. We didn't go into the horror show.(I'm a scary cat) It was great fun. I personally think that the adults have more fun than the kids do. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ended up at this dive because US Airways had many people miss flights. They has me call a 1-800 number and welllll I ended up here. It took an hour to get check into a room and the reception lady was completely loud, rude, a slow moving. The airline said it would be 30-40 dollars. I ended up paying 71.00!!! Furthermore, I finally get my self moving toward my room and the clientele malingering in the hall way are I ogling me and I was in serious fear of my safety. I manage to make it into my room and reasonably settled in for the night and the phone in the room rings at 0100!!! Mind you I have to be up 0400 and now this will ensure that I get 3 hours sleep. The call is the front desk to tell me that they kept my military ID card and I should be sure to stop and get it!!! Ummm NO!!! I have to have the card now it is a security item. She doesn't offer to bring it to me, I have to get dressed again and get the card!!! Can you believe it?! So now on top of a missed connection and coming down with a flu, I've got this disaster of a hotel to deal with. 2 of the pillows had black stains on the pillow cases. Stay if you dare to face the criminal elements, get woken up in the middle of the night, get over charged, have dirty sheets, speak with unempowered unprofessional staff, and then stay up all night due to the sleep disturbance and stay up long enough to write a negative review.

 Super stocked location. This store is well stocked with all sizes. I was impressed on how much inventory this location had. A variety of designs to meet the needs of all shapes, sizes and styles. I like H&M because it is affordable. I'm a career woman who needs career wear then everyday wear for my off days. I got to also have my girls night out wear. This is the store. It is a one stop affordable shop that every gal desires. You can also get razzed and dazzled with the accessories. They have a large selections of jewels to top the outfits off. Handbags, hair accessories and much more. Men and children can score too. H&M has a great selection for them too. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This restaurant has potential, but unfortunately, they fail on implementation. In the past, we waited 2 hours for a delivery. As compensation, we were offered a free meal the next time we ordered. Good enough for me, after all, s*it happens, right? So the next time we ordered, we called and explained what happened and verified that the meal would be free. They checked, then agreed. Great. Except that the delivery guy showed up expecting to be paid (and since they outsourced the delivery, he had himself already paid for the order!). If that wasn't enough, after a couple of months of not eating there, we thought that we would give them one more try. After all, none of the other burger places in Verdun offer veggie burgers. Big mistake. They put things on the burgers that were not in the description. Mayo on my friend's hotdog (mayo on a hotdog?!), cheese on someone else's chicken burger, a burger that was breaded and fried -- also not in the description where it was described as a ""chicken breast"". They also put mayo /all/ over my tofu burger, and since I don't eat eggs, that rendered it pretty much inedible. It was a complete waste of a meal for everyone involved. A waste of food, and money and time. The olds joke of ordering out when your home cooked meal doesn't work out? Yea, we cooked supper instead after this ""food"" arrived. On the plus side, it looks like they have resolved their delivery issues. The guy showed up around 30 minutes after we placed the order. ",1,0,0,0,0

 In my experience this hotel has bad customer service ! After the money I spent to have a corner 2 bedroom premium suite first off my room that I had booked a year in advance i was not promised the same one I was told in which that problem was corrected second our jacuzzi the jets did not work the room was hot ac wasnt working right and third I was given a late check out at 11 given I had extra time I went to walk around miracle mile and when I got back to my room 10ish housekeeping was already cleaning and to top it off all my food was tossed for trash I can't even remember what else I had but I brought up all my concerns to management i was offered to have wifi and valet wavied okay assuming they would take care of it for the whole weekend so okay i took it turns out i still get charged for my valet when i checked out i was not told \ u00a0 it was only for what was all ready on my bill really 25 dollars wavied for my experience they really didn't value my stay for a hotel like the elara im very disappointed and when i called in about this issue the manager stated that there was nothing else he can do pretty sad how my situation was handled.

 I was not impressed by Studio 54 when I last visited this place back in 2005. So unimpressed that I haven't gone there since - perhaps it has changed, but somehow I doubt it. I think Ghost Bar is a cooler place, so in that regard I am slightly biased toward venues that are a bit less - crowded. There didn't appear to be an ""older"" crowd, which I might have enjoyed more. I saw a young crowd that night on the Saturday I was there during summer - and the only faint memory of the night was being accosted by a bunch of short cholos who wanted to dance. Thank goodness for Ghostbar or the night would've been quite uneventful! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Let me start by saying that my experience at this restaurant was so good that I joined Yelp! to write about it. We arrived about 15 minutes early to our 6pm reservation. After a nice trip to the top of THE Hotel in a glass elevator, we were sitting in the fantastic lounge that overlooks the Strip. The view is as amazing as everyone has said, and we enjoyed two very good cocktails which we then took over to our table when we were ready to eat. The dinning room is a beautiful white with glass, contrasting the very dark lounge. We were seated on the outdoor patio, with the strip view accompanying our meal. It was a perfect night in the LV, no heat lamps were needed and it was a phenomenal setting. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about food, and not just the food he was serving. He made great suggestions without trying to force particular dishes. Waters were regularly refilled and plates cleared in a timely manner. Great service. We ordered a bacon, pumpkin and gnocchi appetizer. It was delicious, but I could have used a little bigger portion. Bread was tasty, especially with the house made peanut butter. For dinner my wife ordered the scallops. She loves scallops and thought these were particularly good. I order the steak au poivre, which was heavily crusted in black peppercorns, accompanied with various veggies and cooked perfectly. Very tasty. The gruyere mac and cheese was also delicious. For dessert were ordered the apple dish, Mix is known for its candy bar desert, but sadly I'm allergic to chocolate, so I had to settle for something else. The apple mulliere was tasty, but nothing life changing. I would say the best part of the dish was the green apple sorbet that accompanied it. Overall the atmosphere combined with some pretty tasty food ensures that I will be returning here. Two cocktails, an appetizer, a side, two entrees and dessert ended up being $177, but $50 was covered by the great deal on Restaurant.com. For $127 this was fantastic. Even if the meal is out of your price range, I would recommend trying to make it up here for a cocktail and the view. One of my favorite of many, many experiences in Las Vegas. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was looking forward to checking out this store, because I frequently think his pieces are cute. His store was so tiny though, especially in comparison to the other stores in Caesar's Forums. But, the items they had for sale were just... not cute. Maybe it's a lackluster season for Marc? Where was the color, the cute shapes? It was a tiny grey room with tiny grey shapeless items for sale. I thought maybe I was in the wrong place. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Go for the martinis, don't stick around for the food. I have been here several times for tiny tini Tuesdays - a weekly event that allows you to sample their colorful and delicious martini's in tiny glasses. You order three at a time for a somewhat steep $12. If you want variety though, this is not to be underestimated. However, the food is always lacking. I went on a lunch date here and decided to go for the grilled cheese and tomato basil soup as my stomach wasn't feeling up to anything more adventurous. The grilled cheese was fine. Nothing special. The soup however had a thin drizzle of basil oil which when stirred in made the soup greasy and wholly unappetizing. Your best bet is to head there after work for the martinis and then head around the corner to Six Penn for food. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I came here around 3 or 4am (don't remember) so my review might not be the best, but I'll give it a shot. It was pretty empty when we came and the had a limited menu in the middle of the night. I ordered the filet medalions, potatoes, and scrambled eggs w/ cheese. My friend had eggs with sausage. Everything was good except the filet. It came with two small pieces that were really dry and flavorless. It was still edible at 3am. I remember our waitress being nice. If you're in the Harrah's late at night this place is ok.

 Being a local, i'm not gonna be staying at hotels very often.I comped a room at The Venetian and since i had the weekend off, decided to take advantage.I stayed in a Luxury Suite in the Venetian Tower.The room was great.Nice living room area, comfortable bed, 3 TVs(chilling in the tub and watching Mike Tyson's Greatest Hits on ESPN was awesome), epic couch, etc.I had a great view of Wynn Staff parking lot and what appeared to be the Venetian employee parking.It was free so i guess i can't really complain.Just a little disappointed I wasn't able to stand naked in front of the window and have people from the other tower or other hotel gawk at my manliness. The property itself is amazing, being only 2nd to Bellagio.It has a classy ambience to it.There seems to be always something going on there.A great selection of restaurants, bars and the epic Tao Nightclub.I had a free line pass and admission to Tao but i showed up around 2:45am and they weren't letting anymore people in.A great time to be walking around the casino, as you get a great view of hot chicks walking around barefoot(for those of you with foot fetishes).I was a little too inebriated to go to pool, so i will have to check that out next time.Had a great time there and would actually be willing to pay for it next time. Another thing worth mentioning, i ordered a pizza via in-room dining and I was told it would take about 35-40 minutes.Not true at all...it came in 20 minutes!When i opened the door I was shocked to see the clone of one of the greatest Heavyweight Mixed Martial Artists of all time, Fedor Emelianenko.the resemblance is fucking uncanny.If you are an MMA fan, make sure to order food late at night and catch a glimpse of Fedor's twin, Radek.

 This is my favorite Nordstrom Rack and I'm so happy it opened! Everything is so clean and organized. It's obvious that the staff takes good care of the store and I have never been there when one item has been out of place. It's easy to browse the racks of clothes, shoes, accessories and other products. They also have a great selection of trendy products! I never feel that the store has out-of-date products. Rather, they have items that could have been at Nordstrom a month ago! I'm very happy with this location and they have products of all prices. It's a great place to find a gift for a birthday, baby shower or friend. It's also a great place to find shoes and clothes! ",0,0,0,1,0

 My G/F and I went here after reading reviews I have to say it's just another disappointment in an expensive steak. The wait staff was attentive but our particular waitress didn't seem to knowledgable about the menu. She was fumbling and just had to think a lot about certain ?s I asked. In a place like this the service should be professional and top notch. It simply was not in our case. Also the steak I was wanting they were already out of for the night. I hoped to order the dry aged ribeye. But I had to settle for the bone in ribeye that is not dry aged. When it came out it honestly was a little tough even though being ordered med rare not at all what I expected for a $60 steak. It just was blah really did not have much flavor to it at all. It was really a shame because I think I could do better at home on my grill. We also had crab cakes which were tasty and grilled asparagus which didn't have much flavor either. Loaded baked potatoe was pretty good. Lava cake for dessert was good also. With 1 glass of wine and tip our bill came to $175. Considering I didn't get the steak I asked for the least I thought they could do was comp and app. Or a glass of wine for us. Just an expensive chain restaraunt I don't see what all the fuss is about. We honestly could have had a better meal at a place in southern highlands called Off the strip. They steak was about the same quality I could have gotten there for 40% less $$ the sides are just as good. The same meal there prob would be under $100 for the 2 of us. No one came around asking how is the food. I really should have sent the steak back and gotten something else. The waitress just asked how it was cooked and if I needed anything else. Never suggested or offered any sauces. I cut into it and it looked fine just didn't have any flavor. If she had come back around I prob would have said something. Just saying for $175 I expected a lot better. Just call it like I see it... ",0,1,0,0,0

 I don't live in Champaign anymore but I come back to eat here. It's of course, a no frills, plastic fork kind of place, but if you order off their Chinese menu, you will not be disappointed. Their Spicy Pig Intestine stew is probably the best dish I have ever eaten. Every time I go, I take an order with me. When I am eating it in Chicago, it is so good it makes me want to move back. C-U has always had better asian food than Chicago, but this dish, and it's always a little different, sends me to the moon. I can't speak for their Sesame Chicken or their Egg Foo Young, and if I was as talented as the person in that kitchen, I would be insulted seeing that kind of order come up. That being said, they should probably alter the ambience, but hell, they are mainly existing to serve Chinese students who want authentic chinese food, not people who want a fine dining experience. As long as that dish stays good, I will always come back. They have wonderful food and I like that the prices are lower because there are no waiters or flatware. I would pay 30 dollars for the Intestine dish. I am glad I can still get it for 12. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was disappointed after reading all the positive reviews. I ordered crab ragoon, chicken lomein, sweet and sour pork, and steamed meat dumplings. I got delivery, which was fast & courteous. Overall the food was extremely greasy, I mean literally dripping with grease. I'm wondering if they need to increase the temperature of the deep fryer and or wok. I'm no chef, but I've read that if the oil is not hot enough that the food will retain too much oil. The filling for the crab ragoon was as another reviewer mentioned some of the best tasting I've ever had, but it was ruined by the dripping grease. The sweet & sour pork was almost all breading with very little meat. I'll be trying another restaurant next time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We started out by checking to make sure they are ""accessible"", since one of us has a wheelchair.. and they are, but having not been there before, we had no idea how cramped it is. We got in through one of the front doors, but there is no foyer or open space to wait for a table. They don't take rezzies, so this is important to note -- this is a very popular neighborhood joint and fills up fast. We showed up at about 6 on a Saturday and they were already quite busy. I started tweaking at this point, because it is stressful to navigate a crowded dining room with a w/c, and worse if there is no endpoint. But I only had to suffer for a few minutes (and I'm not even the one in the w/c, just the navigator), as they quickly squoze the three of us into a small table. The food from their small but diverse menu was a-ok and extremely reasonable, and we loved the decor of this homey corner pub in my dear Willy Street 'hood. Mom had the mustard chicken and inhaled it; sister had a bleu-stuffed pork chop and it was also quickly devoured. I had a walleye sandwich, which was not as flavorful as it could have been. The garlicky potatoes with it, however, were delish. We finished with cheesecakes all around (yummmm), and I can tell you they have a most decent beverage list, too. I really hate the stress of no rezzies, though. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The atmosphere: The downstairs bar area is small and cheap looking. The dining room is dated and screams ""cheap 1980's supper club"" - not at all romantic! The restaurant was filled with retirement-age couples/parties about to head to a Krannert performance on the Wednesday evening that we went. This past week, we went to Timpone's to celebrate my birthday. We started off sharing the ""Fritto Misto"" appetizr, described as ""Calamari, Gulf Shrimp, Scallops, Red Onion, and Zucchini."" When the dish arrived, it was nothing but a pile of glorified onion rings. There were only three pieces of calamari (small tentacles), 3 shrimp (which were small, and clearly of the phosphate-pumped Asian variety, and a scattered few wet calico scallops...95% of the ""Fritto Misto"" was red onion. I feel as though by listing the seafood first, that indicates that the bulk will be seafood, or at the very least, there will be an even distribution of the components. Not wanting to be a ""difficult customer"", I chalked it up to just a ""bad batch."" That being said, the recipe was a straight copy of Judy Rodgers' dish in the Zuni Cafe (San Francisco) cookbook, and I could have made it at home... However, when I received my entree, ""Sea Scallops with a Dijon Beurre Blanc on a bed of celery root puree""... I was furious. There were 5 scallops, each approximately the size of a quarter (no exaggeration) and only seared on one side. The mound of puree could not have been more than 1/2 cup (and didn't even taste good). My husband ordered ""Chianti-Braised Shortribs with Homemade Gnocchi"" - which came with fewer than 10 small gnocchi. Worst of all, the food tasted bad; the beurre blanc was so sweet it was like Creme Anglaise with Dijon and I could have done a better braise at home easily. I know that times are tough, and that food costs are supposed to be ~30% of the final restaurant price- but I felt completely gouged. I'm happy to pay for a delicious meal and I do not expect large portions. I travel pretty frequently to Chicago and DC- I know what good food costs and what ""normal"" portion sizes are at ""fine dining"" restaurants. I did not want to make a scene because I didn't want my husband to feel bad for picking the restaurant. The only reason this place could possibly stay in business is because of its proximity to campus/the Krannert Center for Performing Arts or because most people have very low expectations due to the lack of ""Fine Dining"" in the C-U area. Our server was very attentive and great, but the food was so bad (even with the small portions, we didn't finish our food and didn't want to take the leftovers home!). We will not be returning.

 Probably one of the better Chinese places at UIUC, but still not entirely great. We sat down to eat inside and began to peruse the menu which has over 1000 items to choose from. Within 2 minutes we were approached by a waitress and asked if we had any questions, which we did not. After that we were ignored for 15 minutes until we all closed our menus and the waitress immediately came over (maybe that's how it works?). I had the sliced pepper steak which was #644 I believe. For $6.99 it was a pretty decent sized portion. The quality however, was typical of cheap Chinese food, poor. The peppers and onions did not taste fresh at all, but I did still like them. The sauce used was pretty tasty as well as the rice it was served with. Overall, kind of salty, but hey it is Chinese food, right? My friends ordered a seafood Ho-fun and a bok choy and pork, which they said was good. I'd like to try some other menu items. I think Lai Lai is better than Cravings and Chopsticks, for sure.

 I have always liked the Chart House chain, even though I am not a seafood fan! The Chart House in Las Vegas, at the Golden Nugget is one of my favorites! The 75,000 gallon aquarium is the center piece of this restaurant and there is not a bad seat in the house for viewing it! You can even ask the server for a fish identification chart if you are so inclined to learn what types of fish are swimming around in it. It is absolutely amazing! The food too is great. The shrimp cocktail is firm and fresh, served with a great cocktail sauce. The ""Calamari and Friends"" was delicious! I highly recommend. It was lightly fried and very fresh. The ""friends"" included lightly fried veggies -- carrots, peppers, and sweet potatoes. The Chopped Spinach Salad with warm bacon dressing, chopped egg, bacon, radishes & mushrooms wash beautifully presented and then chopped by our server. The dressing was just enough and not overwhelming like can often be with this type of salad. Since I am not a seafood lover, I got the 12 oz. prime rib and it was melt in your mouth! The baked potato that I ordered as a side was also perfectly done. My partner had the Stuffed Flounder filled with jumbo lump crab drizzled with lemon butter and served with Yukon golden mashed potatoes and asparagus. The stuffing was good but the fish lacked some flavor and was rather bland. The prices are right in line with this type of high end restaurant with main dishes costing between $25 and $40.

 Hi again, well I did it, I am the first and only person to complete the entire menu at BurGR, got to meet Gordon himself too at the year anniversary party, he was funny and nice, just a great guy you would want to share a beer with - as usual on my recent trip I dined at BurGR about 4 times, I have eating everything on the menu so now I'm creating new things like having a burger with pita bread instead of a bun, but the best thing is a burger wrapped on lettuce, Paleo diet freindly! (thanks to my boy Garret on dayshift) it was awesome, I even had my buddy Jason try it and he liked it too and ordered one himself the next visit. As always everyone there is amazing, Managers Darren, Benji and Emily came and talked to me and always make every visit great, Servers Garret, Jahaira, Alex with glasses, James, Ginger, cute lil blond girl, guy with Mohawk (sorry couldn't remember everyone's name when I was writing this) and a cast of others always take damn good care of me, I usually ask for 3 tea's and a water (no lemon, that's very important and it's a test to see if my server is really listening to me), cause I drink pretty quickly and they always get it right, are fun to talk to, know the menu front to back, make good suggestions, which in turn makes it for a better dinning experience, also the busser's Jennifer and Kelly kicked butt too, the chefs are always entertaining and friendly, even when they are busy as crap, they will still take time out to say hi, one of the reason's I always sit back there is I like to watch everybody working in the kitchen and see how things run ""HANDS PLEASE"" - over all I have not had a bad experience yet, still don't understand anyone's bad reviews, but I guess every one's experience isn't always the same as everyone else's right, If you had a bad experience the first time I would suggest a second trip back, maybe walk to the front of the line and ask for a manager and just ""calmly"" explain that your first experience wasn't that great and I bet they will go over and beyond to make sure that doesn't happen on your 2nd experience. As for me I go back to Vegas in 18 days and I will probably eat at least 3 times there, the entire staff from the girls at the front, managers, servers, busser's, chefs are always incredible to me and any one I have brought there or told to dine there, even if you don't want a burger go for the desserts ;) till next time David Cagle ",0,0,0,0,1

 I went here for a meeting a few weeks ago and from the moment I got there, I could tell the staff wanted to be anywhere but at work that morning. Maybe it was also the company I was there with, but I felt like I should be about 80 to enjoy. Not that there is anything wrong with being 80, but I don't need to feel that way, yet! I ordered a Cesear salad because there's not a lot of vegetarian dishes. It was blah. Nothing to write home about. Like others have said, I got out of there paying $20, but I got a sad salad and a diet coke. It's on a lake, cute, but it's not a place I will go back to. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is a fun place for drinks and food. The bar is in the middle of the large dining room. The restaurant is well-located in a hip lively area of Scottsdale, near the art walk and canal area. The food is pretty good for a gastropub, but what I really love about this place is the interesting mixed drinks..and oh by the way, food is decent too. Other reviewers have hit on the high food notes such as chopped salad, lamb burger, and scallops. I could settle for the apps, Midwestern Manhattan, and the atmosphere. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We stayed here on our way to Sedona. We arrived at 1130pm and checked out around 9 am. We saw they were pet friendly and the guy gave us a rate of around 50$. I checked my credit card today and saw a charge of $156. I called them to inquire on the charge and they said it was because we had a dog. If you look above, you see it is pet friendly with no mention of any charges. This seems like a scam to me. I'll be on the phone with AMEX in the morning. There are a bunch of places around this area. I'd recommend staying in one of the many other places. Plus, there were some guys at the back entrance smoking something which made me feel uncomfortable for my wife. Maybe choose a different area. EDIT: You can see the honesty from this hotel in the comment below as a response. The manager is named ""john F"" in the title and ""ajay patel"" in the comment body. Let this be a symptom of your experience at the hotel. I suppose he thought putting the ""kennedy"" on the end would be going too far. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Went for dinner last night, ordered the bone in rib eye, was OK however, the side dishes are certainly something you should pass on, had the asparagus, 5 strips of asparagus, seriously? $12 bucks for 5 asparagus smothered with cheese, the twice baked potato was a joke, overcooked and dry spinach was so so. Service was OK, this place used to be about the food, now I think its all about the money, so many better choices out there.

 Another valley must have! If you've lived here in Arizona for a while, then you've heard of Miracle Mile Deli. They've been very popular in the valley for some time, and for good reason. Some of the best deli foods served anywhere, at a decent price, and very clean. I saw someone comment that the place reminded them of a hospital with it's cleanliness. Well, it is very clean, but not to the point of not wanting to be there...that's silly. Always good service and very quick. I will always recommend this Deli to friends. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This was our 2nd visit to this location, the first after they just opened. We came in around 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon, not too busy as we were sat in less than 10 min. My wife and I decided to get the stuffed deep dish pizza, we always enjoy their thin crust so we thought this should be good. As we were ordering the waitress told us the deep dish can take up to 45 mins to bake, since we weren't sure we wanted to wait that long, we told her to make it a thin crust. She then told us it would be 30 mins for a thin crust!? So we decided for an extra 15 mins we would stay with the deep dish. Over an hour later the pizza was finally delivered to our table and we were both starving. After a couple of bites, we both looked at each other and remarked how hard and thick the crust was! I was nearly impossible to cut it with a knife! Not only hard but absolutely no flavor to it. We ended up just eating the filling out of our slice which was good. We both did not want any more! When our waitress came back, she said that the manager wanted to buy us dessert for our wait but we literally lost our appetite from the pizza. We may go back again but never will order that pizza again, yuck! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Well we all know KFC is known for ""Finger Licking Good"" but we may not always have known them for quality service. This location is in the Spectrum Mall Parking Lot that offers dine in, carry out and drive thru. I frequently visit this location to pick up lunch for the office. I have only used the drive thru once which was a quick nice experience the other times I did carry out. The interior is nice and the location is well kept with cleanliness but I have been disappointed in getting wrong orders or there not being enough chicken. The staff is very friendly and acknowledge/greet everyone who walks through the door. They great about honoring coupons and ringing in orders. Matter of fact they repeat the orders so it throws me off when my orders are wrong. My very last experience was during lunch right at 11:15am. I ordered grilled only Chicken for the office and there was not enough which was strange since I was only ordering 10 pieces. The friendly cashier told me the wait would be 20 mins so I decided to wait. He offered me a drink for my wait. Well I declined his offer even though that was a kind gesture. After playing the waiting game it took 40 mins for my chicken to be ready. Not sure why or how this would have taken so long but it did. The food was good which kept the office happy though they really need to get the service part down when it comes to the food. Once they take care of this I see more stars added to their ratings.

 I am a Magic player who used to come here regularly back in '06 and '07. They had a case for magic singles and binders of rares. Not anymore. Gamer's Inn has devoted all their magic singles sales to their online store. Since they got rid of their computer room, the interior decor looks terrible. DO NOT buy the ""instant MTG collection"". The value of the ""random"" cards in the box are maybe worth half of what they charge for them: $70 for about $30 worth of jank rares, and useless commons and uncommons. You are not allowed to look at the cards until after you buy them; meanwhile, the staff has already Pre-sorted the cards ""to guarantee you get a certain number of rares, etc"". In other words, THEY know what is in the box (i.e., junk) but YOU don't get to know until they have your money- and no take-backs! Selling bulk cards is a perfectly acceptable way to dispense of low-value cards- but slapping a ""random cards"" label on them and inflating the price is a con game. Too bad, I used to really like this place. ",0,1,0,0,0

 DO NOT GO HERE!!!! WOW, were to begin on what is wrong with this facility. I have been going to this place for over 7 years and I have never had such horrible customer service until the recent eye doctor took over. The only reason I ranked it a 1 is because it won't let me rank it a zero! I have given them multiple chances because everyone can have a bad day, but strike 3 your out! The new doctor here does not ""LISTEN"" to his patience and pretty much does what he wants. Also, this place is now nickle and diming customers to death. Maybe if you applied a little effort and kindness toward your customers you wouldn't have to pillage and plunder them and more customers would come your way. There are two ladies here that have worked at this facility since I've started and a word of advice, ""Find another employer because you are too good for this place."" You have always been friendly and helpful to me, even when trying to fix the other employees screw ups. Like when I ordered contacts and they went on backorder but nobody felt it necessary to make any attempt to contact or inform me of the situation. ""I"" had to call you guys 8 days later to find out what was going on. Guess what they are still on backorder and have no eta date. I'd hate to ask for another brand to use because they will probably charge me another $50.00 contact fitting even though its not my fault. If this is the closest facility to you or your insurance only takes Nationwide Vision. Go out of your way to avoid this place and find another Nationwide Vision to assist you. You will save yourself an enormous amout of frustration and money. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Lunched at BJ's today with colleagues. We were all in the mood for breakfast. Our server, Vanessa, was absolutely terrific. I ordered a dry spinach egg white omelette with a little feta and it was one of the best I've had in Vegas. Just had a great spice on it. I asked for avocado on the side instead of potatoes and toast and they accommodated me. No brewed iced tea w/free refills - just bottled tea, which was a negative for one of my lunch-mates. My other colleague loved the steak and eggs -- a great deal at about $5! Dinner/lunch/happy hour menus all look great too. Seemed a bit smoky the first time I was there, but it was fine at lunch-time today. Highly recommend this place. Can't wait to go back and try the salmon entree.They also have happy hour and late night food deals. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Cab #785. Took cab from hotel to airport. The hotel told me to make sure to ask to go through paradise. But the cab initially wanted to take the highway (much more miles and not faster - I had google maps up). While following my instructions initially the driver decided to go his own way despite my repeated request to go my way. He then proceeded to tell me that I could drive if i wanted and that his job was to take me to the airport the way he wanted. He then insisted again on how his way was better (it was slightly longer). Also they dont tell you until when you are about to click on okay that there is a $3 charge to pay with credit card. Very bad experience. There was no complain number and it was hard to see the driver's ID. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Went for the Latin/Salsa nights advertised on the website. I think the DJ played maybe 6 Latin songs, one salsa, a few merenge, some reggaeton and then it all went to hell. I think some of the patrons requested some not so ""Latin"" music and next thing you know, it was time for ""let me take a selfie"". I can see why the crowd was so small since they likely do not stick to the advertised music. I wrote the DJ a note, ""It is Latin/Salsa night, you should play that sh** meng"" with an unhappy face.

 I've been to tasty station serval times. The food is tasty and they have good lunch prices. The one thing I will note is that it takes way too long to get your food! My co-worker and myself go during lunch but we are going to have to stop going because it takes them 30 min to 50 min to bring us our food and we do not have enough time to eat because our lunch is over by the time we get our food. I do not understand why it takes them so long they are not even busy. One time it took them 30min and we were the only ones in the place? Today we had to leave because they had two other tables and after 45 min they had not even begun cooking our food ( they only had two other table sof 3-5 people)? If they do not pick up the pace they will be out of business soon. ",0,0,1,0,0

 It's Overrated! Plain and simple! The reason it's famous is that it offers aspects that most Phoenix restaurants lack: (1) It's not a chain (2) It has hip swanky northern California feel as it is next to a wine bar. It didn't hurt that Jerry Colangelo would publicly recommend this place for a date and soon it just became a hit. It was a trendier option to the usual bar food right before a Suns game. That's how it got famouse. People would park and dine here early before Diamondback and Suns games and then walk to the game afterwards. However, when the #1 ranking came out, it just drove this place through the roof. The food hasn't changed. Yes, they make great pizza but like another reviewer mentioned, i can think of at least 5 places in Phoenix that offer better pizza. Is it worth the wait...most certainly not. It's just annoying now because any out-of-town guest wants to dine here and taste the ""best pizza in America"" and they are always let down. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Seller beware is right! You get little to nothing when you consign with them and they do not accept responsibility when they loose or misplace your merchandise.

 I moved from Columbus, OH to Pittsburgh and was elated to find out that my COSI membership in Columbus was still usable at the Children's Museum. While C-bus's children's museum is mainly about science, Pittsburgh's has art and what not going on. My son loves this place and has finally discovered the art room. He's not super creative but he likes the fact that he can pop on an apron and paint. He even threw a clay cup and silk screened some paper cut outs. They have other workshop space where you can sew or build lil motors. The changing tough art exhibits are neat too. On the downside, if an exhibit opens try to see it early.

 Oishii is one of growing number of Sushi restaurants in Edinburgh, but does a good job of standing out from the crown. I am massive sushi fan and i'm fairly confident that I have worked my way round almost all of the sushi joints in town, but there is something really special about this one before you even start to eat. Its very small and intimate, tastefully decorated and doesn't feel gimmicky - I would go as far as to say it feels quite authentic. While the kitchen is though the back, the sushi chef (and I guess owner as he has been there since it opened and is incredibly passionate about what he does) stands though the front and prepares the sushi to order in front of the customers. There are a handful of stools around the counter to sit, or at the window if you fancy people watching on rose street plus a few proper tables if there is a group of you. I would always recommend booking ahead though, as it really only seats about 20. The actual food is great too. I won't be going as far as to say its the best in Edinburgh, but its certainly 4 star worthy. Importantly though, its very reasonably priced and you are hard pushed to find better value. The menu is not massive, but that's a good thing as its common for sushi places to offer way too many combination. This shows me that they know what works best, and that's what they want you to try. I was particularly impressed with their spicy tuna had rolls, and the flavour and texture of the tuna is unlike most other places and when I complimented this, I was offered a detailed explanation this was, again giving an insight to the passion of the chef and the attention to detail that he puts into the food. If you are a Sushi fan, I highly recommend giving it a try. ",0,0,0,1,0

 First let me say that kickball is FUN, as it should be!! Our team has a blast! BUT, let me say that our league, AZ VALLEY, SUCKS!! They are so unorganized it's ridiculous. You know of the ""half season"" party they so promote and say is just so awesome was just about the lamest, unorganized, pathetic event I've ever seen. The ""host bar"" Hazelwoods, was packed with tons of people, non kickball players, there was no where for our team to sit, much less stand. We were told they weren't really even aware that we were having our mid season ""party"" there. The ""specials"" that we were told about were simply the ""specials"" that Hazelwoods always has, so nothing special for AZ VALLEY league. Then, we were supposed to get ""tickets"" for free drinks... But of course, you had to wait until 10pm to get them. So, if you played at 7pm and were done at 8pm, you were supposed to sit around and wait until likely after 10pm to get your ""free drink ticket"". I don't know about you guys, but some of us have to work on friday and don't want to sit around for a ""free drink"" until after 10. Sure, we drank and stayed out, but NOT at Hazelwoods which was packed. The start of our season was delayed by almost a full month because some other league had issues and had to use our field. Then of course, we had two rain delays (ok, reasonable). But a season that should have started in Sept and end in Dec. is still playing in FEBRUARY! Folks, I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. This league is VERY unorganized, and for $70 and having to referee games, I will NOT be joining this league again. I'm sure there are other leagues that are better organized, but AZ VALLEY is NOT. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I received a great hotel deal here through email. Thought it seemed too good to be true but it wasn't. Booked 4 nights in a 1 bedroom condo style unit for $340.00 bucks! The Good: Well kept hotel and ground Outstanding service from every Westin employee I encountered. Nice up to date rooms with great beds. 2 pools - 1 Adult only....Bonus! Free shuttle to the neighboring Westin resort next door and the shopping center near by. Free Parking. Great decks & patios off the the rooms with furniture and ceiling fans. The Bad No hotel or bar on site really because this is the Villa. You can go next door to the main hotel and there are several to choose from with is a plus. Only window in the 1 bedroom condo was the sliding glass door off of the bedroom. Rest of the unit felt like cave almost because there were no windows.

 I was very disappointed to find that the closest Goodwill to my daughter's had closed--until I saw this location which is even closer to where I am staying in town. I stopped in there this evening and found it is an even larger store located where the Gold's Gym used to be, a 30,000 sq. ft. area. They have a pretty big selection spread out, all the usual clothing and housewares plus tons of Halloween costumes, accessories and decorations since it's September. I found the sewing and notions section off on the left wall and bought some yarn for the preemie hats I knit, plus a pretty lavender baby blanket for my new granddaughter and a plastic container to keep craft supplies in. Today was senior day (lucky break) so I got 25% off my purchase, also there isis always one color tag 50% off and once or twice a month they have a 50% off everything day. They don't have garage sale prices because it's a store with rent, employees, electricity, phone and advertising, etc. to pay but the prices still beat what buying new costs. If I don't want to pay the price I just don't buy it. The store looked as clean as can be expected for a thrift shop where customers are constantly messing things up and the two clerks I dealt with we're pleasant and helpful. There is a huge private lot to park in. I'll be back soon with my daughter to look around again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Yeah, not impressed. We ordered the fried zucchini to start. It's great that it's freshly hand battered, but they seem to have forgotten something -- the FLAVOR. This stuff had no seasoning on it at all, so we have to pour on a generous helping of salt to get it to taste like anything. And for $8 that's disappointing. We each ordered burgers. At $10 a pop I was expecting a nice juicy burger. What I got was dry and totally tasteless. The whole burger just tasted like nothing. Perhaps their salt shaker fell on the floor and rolled under the fridge or something tonight. It was accompanied by some typical frozen steak fries. Again NO SALT OR SEASONING. For a $40 night out I really shouldn't have to dump salt all over everything I order. The service...meh. Our server was so meek I could barely hear her. Serving takes a bit of personality, no? When we asked what the happy hour specials were, she said ""Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....it depends on the drink."" What? What does that mean? Basically it means you get a random discount on whatever you order, maybe, perhaps. There is no list, no standard ""$5.00 well drinks"" or anything normal like that. It's basically ""order something and hope it's on our happy hour specials."" Rather disappointed. They need to either lower their prices or kick it up a notch on the food and service. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Chose this hotel since I was in town visiting wife and had some hotel points to burn. Had I done my homework I would have stayed somewhere else. I am a top tier member of their frequent stay program. The room we were given was nothing special. We had a broken refrigerator outside of our room when we arrived. The room service trays that were in the hallway when we checked in stayed there for two days. The air conditioner barely kept the room cool enough. The refrigerator they put in the room wouldn't cool bottled water down unless it was put in freezer. This hotel looks and feels old. The pools inside and out didn't appear to have been cleaned in a while. We never ate at the hotel as there are many other places our family had planned for us to eat at. Cost me 5k in points all in all. Would NOT stay here again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I went there tonight and had their wings and burger. Both were awesome. I always get my wings extra crispy and very hot with blue cheese. They didn't have blue cheese but I reluctantly ordered anyhow. The wings were neither crispy or very hot. The set up was perfect for a disaster. As it turned out, the garlic ranch was pretty awesome, and the wings fell off the bone. They were extremely tasty as well. Needless to say, quite a nice surprise. The burger was fantastic as well. Not a huge selection of beers, about 5 in total but the pumpkin kilt lifter and IPA were good. Bartender actually was there for more than just a paycheck which is odd these days. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I wished they had 0 stars because this place doesn't even deserve a 1 Thanks for ruinin my big 2-1 Checkin was a bit slow and they told us that we don't get a deal for marquee even though we stayed there btw it was a lie cause I got in for free Stayed at the wraparound suite and yeah it was pretty but everything was dusty The bath I wouldn't even want to dip my feet in there So got to the room the remote control for the television hardly even worked Checked the fridge and there was already a yoohoo gone The dining table was sticky it looked like someone threw up in the bathroom area For the whole weekend I had the do not disturb sign out and on Saturday they came in anyways talk about rude and invasion of privacy Their plumbing sucks too.. I peed.. wiped my down there ...flushed once and it clogged... Seriously? I peed and it clogged After we called for the plumber to come they fixed it after 30 minutes During check out guess what? They charged us $250 for damages.. Really? Come on your a resort in Vegas and youre going to charge $250 for using a plunger I could've just paid $2.00 for my own plunger at cvs not only that they charged 56. Something for using the minibar and i did not remove anything or touched it After calling the Lobby a guy supervisor said that they wouldn't charge for the minibar and that the housekeeping supervisor would come and check for the damages After coming the supervisor said everything was clear and that she would call and tell them not to charge So.. I thought I wasn't going to be chafed anything and saw $250 on my transaction and the next day $56 on it they didnt even take anything off After calling many times I finally got through The first time I called they told me that it was because we damaged something I told them that the housekeeping supervisor called them that it was clear they told me that they didn't receive a call which angered me they forwarded the call to the person who made the report and they didn't pick up (not a surprise) I left a voicemail to tell them to call me back never got a call back (a week later still no call) yeah called again and now they tell me that it was a housekeeping charge really now who has ever gotten charged for house keeping when you had a do not disturb sign out -.- Kept fighting and they told me that they were going to get to supervisor which would call on Friday and still no call This is some bs charging me 300+ and ignoring and also making different charges and so far I still have the charges And yes they still didn't call me back time to call the AGAIN -.- This is a warning don't ever come to this resort and just repeating thanks... for ruing my 21st birthday ",1,0,0,0,0

 I give the casino/ bar area an ok review..due to us leaving Prive cause it sucked so bad. I actually liked one little bar I found with a lounge in the middle of the casino & the dj playing some good tunes while people were randomnly dancing Andrew the bartender was amazing he made the best rasberry cheesecake shots, hooked it up with a few daquiris, woo woos, & the mystery drink that was so good but had bacardi 151 I was gone thanks to him!! Also a plus when we were leaving to head back to the room ..Thriller came on which led me to moonwalk 20 feet while people were playing slots down the aisle & then a quick spin & crotch grab for good luck..oh friday in vegas was good towards the end of the night!

 Took the wife and daughter here for lunch on a Saturday after we heard all the hype about the burgers. The burgers are good, not great, but not bad either, lets say middle of the road. I really like the bacon, it was crispy, yet not burnt. I had the Cajun fries while my wife and daughter had the regular fries. Cajun fries had great flavor, but both styles are soggy and didn't really taste done. I agree with some of the other reviews on here, NO SHAKES????? How can this be, a burger joint with no shakes? The atmosphere in this place is terrible, the tables are so close together, your practically sitting arm and arm with people you don't know. The lighting is brutal, we felt like we were under interrogation lights!! I think when I have that craving for a burger and shake, I will go the extra distance and drive out to Cheeburger Cheeburger, being we have no great burger joints out in old Henderson. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Don't go here. The food came out cold and was way overpriced. Cheaper and tastier meals are everywhere in Vegas, so don't give this place another thought. I would suggest going to Panda Express for a more authentic experience. Yes, Panda Express = More Authentic Experience. For a city filled with Asian gamblers, it was odd to see no other Asian person dinning at an Asian restaurant (always a big negative in my book). Maybe their frequent game play has given then enough comps to dine elsewhere, so I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt as far a demographically biased portion of my rating goes. I ordered the prix fixe menu where the main course was braised sea bass. The sea bass was more boiled than braised. It was texturally unappealing and had no flavor. The greens that accompanied it were overcooked and essentially dead. I really should have just gone to the food court.... ",0,1,0,0,0

 I went here early on Tuesday morning around 10 and they were just 1 other party in the joint. My boyfriend and I headed to the stool seats in front and began this mission of smoked meat goodness!

 Cheap as far as buffets on the strip go, but not very good and I could have easily gotten a better meal for the same price that was not all you can eat. The mashed potatoes were a little watery, and the selection was pretty limited. Plus, there were children crawling everywhere and it made you feel like you were in the kiddie section of Disneyland. I was also kind of sad that I couldn't order alcohol throughout my meal. I must say though, I got pretty excited when I found the kids food section after the first disappointing plate. I'm always happy eating pizza, because for some reason ""bad"" pizza tends to be decent. Two thumbs up on the frozen yogurt machine, that's one thing I'll never grow out of. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Thank goddess a decent ramenhouse has opened in Vegas. I used to live in Cali and went for ramen several times a week (yes, I am an addict). I'm very picky about the quality of my ramen, and Monta, Shuseki, Ichiza, etc. just don't cut it. (Personally, I think Monta is highly overrated. I gave it at least 5 visits to make sure, and it still does nothing for me. But that's for another review.) Finally Vegas has something that lives up to the better places in California. I would rank it in my top five ramens, having explored San Francisco, San Mateo, San Jose, Santa Monica and Los Angeles. Like any typical ramenhouse, Sora's space is limited. Most likely you'll have to wait for a table, and they don't take reservations. Your best bets are to come either early or late into the peak dining hours. But please don't go right before closing. If you've ever waited tables, you know how annoying this is, especially when these latecomers assume they can hang out for hours after closing time when all the chairs are put up and floor mopped. And then tip 10%. But I digress. On opening night, we ordered the fried rice with special sauce, an interesting combination. The special sauce was a thick, opaque cornstarch-ladden concoction, a little salty and tinged with chopped scallions. It somewhat reminded me of the more rural Japanese breakfast noodles dipped in ""slime."" If you're not into this type of texture, then steer clear away from the special sauce. Overall, it gave an interesting contrast to the savory fried rice and pickled ginger (the red slivered kind, not the sweeter sushi kind). The gyoza was decent, nicely crispy bottoms with a chewy skin. But what blew me away was their homemade dipping sauce. I haven't had this good a sauce in so long. It was a perfect balance of soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar, garlic. I couldn't get enough. My entire table ordered miso, half of us the spicy version. I do agree with other reviewers that the spicy was not very, but it did have that little extra karamiso kick prevalent at some other ramenhouses. No need to supplement with a side of kimchi here (which they don't offer on the menu anyway). The broth was succulent, rich and oh-so flavorful with bits of fat dotting the bowl. Oftentimes the richer the broth, the less they tend to give you, and Ramen Sora makes no exception in that. Personally I would prefer just another half-to-one more ladle of broth, but what they DO serve you will be pretty sufficient for most people. One of the highlights of my heaven-in-a-bowl was the chashu. Thick cut and hearty, yet so tender it almost disintegrates in your chopsticks -- let alone melt in your mouth. You can tell the pork has been well-cooked for a good length of time, letting the fat render into the succulent meat itself. The noodles are the other highlight. Thick, hearty, perfectly-cooked...in a word: amazing. Ramen Sora's noodles are deliciously chewy, making a nice mouthful after mouthful. (One of the most disappointing things about MONTA is their style of noodle. Admittedly, this is just my opinion, but I do not care for their sliver-thin wimpy noodles. They hold no flavor, and the texture reminds me of oversoaked bean thread.) The servers are friendly and attentive, and I'm was quite shocked at how slammed they were on opening day. Word of ramen travels fast anywhere you go. I stopped by after work today to get a couple orders to take home. Not surprisingly, I was their very first take-out order. I was amused to watch them explore how to pack their wonderful ramen for travel. Unfortunately, because the eggs are only parboiled/partially cooked and are meant to complete cooking when served in broth, they weren't able to supply me with egg. I asked if they could give me a fully-boiled egg, but the chef wasn't able to at this time. No biggie. Instead, I opted for extra menma (fermented bamboo) because I love the flavor and ""chewy"" crunch. I'm sure they'll work out this small detail in the future. The noodles held up well hours later, as well as a stovetop reheating of the broth. The flavors were all there, and at home I can slurp in comfort! Some will come to Sora and knock it down because they're only familiar with Monta. Others will become complete converts. Whatever your preference, I still highly recommend you give all styles of ramen a try. It is diversity that makes life interesting after all, isn't it? ",0,0,0,0,1

 So here's the deal on JITB. In the 5 years we have lived in Buckeye we have only gone through the drive thru at this location. We have only gotten the oreo shakes. (Little tip if you bring them home and put them in the freezer for a couple of hours they are simply awesome you eat them with a spoon) So yesterday my wife and I decided to stop in here and get some of the food. The service was very friendly as it always has been. The dinning room was cleanish, but for whatever reason the men's bathroom was closed. The food honestly was not good. A couple of cheeseburgers, an order of curly fries, a couple of tacos that I have heard people rave about, and a drink. The meat on the burgers is obviously a frozen patty that was overcooked and dry. The fries were ok, but the tacos were not that good, and I cannot figure out why people would rave about them. Really aside from the occasional oreo shake I will not be returning to this place for anything else. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Wanted to give it higher rating BUT had to bring it down due to three reasons - check in and check out lines are insane! It felt like I was in line at amusement park. It took at least 30 mins in line to get my keys, not cool! - 1 point Another reason was that the lines for the elevators were just as long! They need more elevators! It was crazy having to wait so long to go up and down to my room on 17th floor. -1 The third reason - WAY too many kids! I felt I couldn't really enjoy Vegas to full extent as there were so many strollers and kids walking all over the casino. I mean really people - go to circus circus if you really HAVE to bring your kids. You really don't. It's expensive and not appropriate when there is so much second hand smoke around (I was having trouble dealing with that, and can only imagine how the kids feel!). Because there were so many kids, I ended up going to the Luxor and Excelsior and other casinos to go have fun. The pools were packed with families and kids and not the setting I was hoping for my first Vegas trip-1 The good points are that the hotel itself is beautiful, the room was very nice with great view. The walls are thin though and the neighbors (who had kids) were banging on our door asking that me and my friend , to keep it down because they couldn't sleep (11pm). What's worse is that at that time we were just watching tv and not even talking loud or doing anything else since we had just flown in and were already tired. The restaurants at the Mandalay were awesome! Hubert Keller's burger bar was awesome (must try nutella shake) as well as Border Grill (carnitas were heaven). I was there for a training for work and the convention center was great, roomy, even though quite far. The Shark Aquarium was also really cool, though a lot smaller than I expected. My recommendation - if you are looking for family friendly hotel and Casino, I guess this would be the place. If you are Young, single or just want to party at Vegas - this is not the place to stay. When I go back to Vegas I will go to a more adult centered hotel. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I knew this place would be good when I walked in and there were fresh eggs on the kitchen counter! How nice to see that they used real We came here on a Saturday morning at 9:30 am, and there was hardly anyone here. I found it refreshing that their menu was simple and not not overwhelming. The waitress was super friendly and really good with her suggestions - she pushed us to try the cheddar jalapeno biscuit, and I am so glad we did! We got the breakfast burrito, turkey bacon, egg whites, coffee, and a biscuit. And YES, the biscuits are fantastic - fresh, hot, soft in the middle. So good! Coffee is great and is served in gigantic mugs so they don't have to bug you a million times to top it off. Service was great. Food was great. Atmosphere was great as well.

 Usually pick up Soup and salads to go. Used to be good few months ago when it had just opened but recently since about a month ago they changed their containers and have become very stingy with their portions. You order a medium soup cup but will get only half cup (equivalent to small) I had ordered their Gallon soups too which come in a small bucket (not even close to half gallon). Same goes with the salads, very less quantity and ingredients. If you add chicken to your salads you get couple small pieces of chicken (not worth paying extra). I ordered chicken Enchilada soup, you have to pay extra if you need to sprinkle with half a spoon of cheese or sour cream!!! You need to order 3 salads to make it equal to one regular salad from other restaurants. I had just tried the Glendale location, not sure if all other locations are like that too! ",0,1,0,0,0

 All I can say to the people who think this place is expensive: You have never actually BEEN to a theme park that's expensive. Granted, we are Phoenicians so coming back on a season pass is obviously an option but even if you compare the other stuff to, say Six Flags Hurricane Harbor in NJ (we went a few months ago while visiting the family), this place is a WHOLE lot cheaper and so much easier to get around. Lockers: $7 here vs. $20 at SF Unlimited fountain drink wristband: $7 (our family used one and we all shared) vs. not available at SF (but they DO offer a $10 souvenir cup that's refillable for $1) Parking: $7 vs. $25 at SF (no, that's not a typ-o; and you'll feel like you walked to Philly by the time you get to the actual entrance) Food items were in line with SF but not as high as Disney/Universal. My sons, age 7 & 10 had a blast today! Also, I couldn't belive how quickly we got back to our car! Other places like SF and Disney you walk forever! Granted, they're a lot bigger, but I feel like there's so much wasted space around the entrance/exit points at those places.. Great park layout. Very clean as well. We'll be regulars now that the kids are old enough to enjoy all the rides. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Not impressed. I went to the Vinter Grill with my girlfriend and her family. We called ahead to tell them we had two dinners that were vegan (me and my girlfriend), and they said they would accommodate us. When we got there I asked the host to confirm the chef knew we were vegan. He looked at me like he had no idea what I was talking about and told me to tell the waitress myself. When I did tell the waitress she looked at me like she had never heard of the word vegan and said she didn't know what that meant. Great. So, I explained it to her and she said she would ask the kitchen. Long story short the chef took some pizza dough and some noodles and made a marinara sauce with some veggies, put half on the pizza and half on the noodles and gave it to us. So little care and thought from a place so highly rated. I will not go back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm giving this location 2 stars, soley for its convenient location. Otherwise it would have been 1. My wife and I go specifically for the Goya products, and tortillas. Well, on Saturday she goes and finds they were having deals on other items, and ended up spending $53.88. She gets home, starts cooking, and realizes the very specific bottle of seasoning, which she went there to get in the first place, was Not among the other groceries. Also missing was a jalape \ u00f1o pepper. No worries, just a mile down the street. When she gets there, with receipt in hand, she explains the situation to the store mgr. Well, apparently, a missing $0.88 jalape \ u00f1o, and an almost $3 bottle of seasoning, is not to be taken lightly. The manager went ""straight to the video tape!"". Questioned the cashier, and bagger (who both said she took them with her), and then argued with my wife that she was wrong/mistaken. We're maybe talking $5, at the very most, of items off of a grocery bill, which cost over $50. Took her almost 15-20 mins of disputing with the guy, until they finally compensated her.

 Being pretty new to the Tempe area, I have to say this place is great. Why? Firstly, the environment and the staff here have been top notch and friendly since day one since I started being a customer at XB until even now, never a bad customer service experience. Secondly, I was rather happily surprised at the people you can end up meeting and picking a convo up with. Pretty much everyone I have met so far has been really interesting and welcoming, and down right just fun to speak with. Last but not least, the shop does offer quite a bit of good loose teas, in-house roasted coffees, and tasty specialty treats. Tip to anyone new to Tempe that might live in this area: Come down, get a drink, strike up a convo! You never know, you might make a friend or two. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Nice little Mexican joint in North Scottsdale - puff puff pass please wink! Literally, just pass. Parking is limited for such large place so I wonder what happens during rush hour, or maybe they didn't expect any rush! The food - tacos, nachos, chimichungas, etc....nothing too impressive, but I can't say I was dissatisfied. I didn't expect much so I wasn't too disappointed. I ordered a couple of drinks and maybe I should have ordered more to drown out the sorrow of this experience!

 FAIL, This place was cool when they first opened. I go here on occasion when I have a bunch of laundry piled up. You have to buy a card and put money on it. Well I have a couple of cards as I have forgotten to bring it before. Well I go to use one of my cards and it says invalid card. I had money on it and bought it here. Well I call the number on the back and it rings to a full voicemail box. The attendant is rarely there but I asked her and she offered no help. They even state to fill out a refund form located next to the cards. Well guess what, there are no forms or a place for them. As far as the place, it used to be clean but they cut the help and so it goes hours with no attendant. One time I was there and there was even food on the counters that someone had left. The prices are pretty steep to use the good machines and the driers take at least two cycles to dry anything. It is sad too because this place used to be nice. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The restaurant was very crowded and noisy. Some baby was screaming throughout the entire meal. The noise was exacerbated by the lack of any carpet or tapestry to muddle sound.

 The only two saving graces to this location: Angela who worked at the Benefit Brow Bar (but now she's left left) and the GM, Pam (but she's rarely ever there) The store is lacking associates. They're out of product 75% of the time even though they just received their shipment. The other benefit bar employee (I don't even know her name) tries to claim she's done your eyebrows before and then acts that you've somehow like jumped ship or something by going to the other Aestetician. She said to me ""oh hey, I used to do your eyebrows"" I looked at her like she was insane and said... No you didn't? Funniest thing is I didn't even know they did brows until Angela pulled me over one Sunday when I was buying bronzer. It came across as a blatant lie in attempt to steal her colleagues customer.. Then I found out she did it to my grandma, too... Who I had referred to Angela. What?! Worst of all, the fill in temp 'manager' or whatever her authority roll is, Frances is degrading to her employees openly in front of customers. I've seen her act in ways a ""manager"" never should... as I stood with my mouth wide open. Because of all of this, even though this store is a few minutes from home I will drive a little further to Town Square to take my business to Sephora and search for wherever Angela went to do brows because she is awesome!

 Serious BBQ!! Dusty really knows his stuff!! I ordered the mixed rib platter minus the babies, and instead subbed another beef rib. To round out my meal was the loaded mash and I added some greens. I won't be hungry again until at least this time tomorrow!! Rollin' Smoke's rub compliments the flavor of both the beef and spare ribs nicely. I added a little of their spicy BBQ sauce because I like my BBQ to have a bit of a kick. The spareribs were perfect and the beef ribs were very impressive. Smokey but not overpowering. Dusty came to my table and asked how everything was, and I couldn't compliment him enough. He shared his technique on how he preps the beef ribs. I guess I'll be back, because I certainly don't have that kind of patience!! If you're in Vegas craving BBQ, this is the place to go. The portions are big, the prices extremely fair, and the atmosphere removes you from the strip and puts you in a true BBQ joint that you leave smelling smokey! This is real BBQ and not that over salty crap that Famous guy prepares in several spots around town. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We came here with a group of 9. A few of us had maybe 2 spoon fulls of left overs when we were done eating the ""all you can eat sushi."" 3 people had 2 bites of salad. One had a bite of rice left. One person had a spoon full of soup at the bottom of her bowl. When we were done the server came over & told us if we didn't finish those last bites of our food they would have to charge extra to the whole table. Really? What if we didn't like the food? You would still make us eat it? Then the server didn't know how to ring up the bill & tried charging us extra anyway. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone! It's like a prison camp where they are constantly watching us eat and checking our plates as they take each one away! Not a good way to keep customers coming back. Oh and they put extra rice in every sushi roll to get you full faster... ",1,0,0,0,0

 Love this place, but my last visit was a little sub-par. Server was a little standoffish, and the food preperation was not what I was expecting, especially when the bill rises above $40-50 after tip. Probably go back again, but I'm hoping for a much better experience when I do. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Ok, so recently became a family of 3 instead of 2 and our dining options have changed and also our dining out frequency. We looked online and thought the reviews looked great so drove 30 miles to this place for lunch. The greeter was very pleasanrt and the ambience lovely on a Sunday afternoon. Our waitress arived after approx 15 mins and had a very unusual affect, would not make eye contact and kept interupting us mid-sentence. I asked for advice about the Italian wine list and she interupted me and said ""I'll just bring you a sample of 2, it will save time"" and then turned to my husband to ask what he wanted. Weird, but I let it go. Then when she returned for my drink order I asked her for bottled water as the tap water that was given to us tasted odd, she said she agreed and walked away, when she returned I asked if they got a lot of complaints about the heavy taste of chlorine in the water and she said ""different people have diferent tastes"" and when I emphasised how bad it tasted she said ""it's an ongoing battle"" while walking away from us. Incredibly rude waitress and I couldn't believe she didn't seem to care when a customer had a complaint. After approx 15 more minutes in a relatively empty restaurant our appetizer was served. We ordered the carpaccio and it was ok, it needed some seasoning and especially would have benefitted from some more citrus. I ordered the Buffalo DOP and it was a big disappointment. No flavor (I ordered it without the parmesan) and very wet with tomato sauce. My husband enjoyed the quattro formaggio but agreed that it was far inferior to Cibo, Bianco et al. The final insult was when I went to the bathroon to change my baby's diaper and found myself unable to as there was no changing table, I guess they expected the many moms in the room to change their children on the floor. When I brought this to the attention of the seater on the way out her reaction was ""yeah, we don't have one"" as per all 20 year old Scottsdale ladies and was quite unruffled by my predicament and definitely offered no alternative. Add to this the general attitude of the staff (young waitress chatting with the seater and walking away shaking her head and obviously mad about something) and the heat within the restaurant ( about 10 degrees above comfortable) and the fact that nobody came and asked us how our meal was or if we needed anything and overall our experience was ABYSMAL. will never return as we felt like we were unimportant in their day and overall felt like we had wasted our money and our family day out.

 This place is awesome! I've only had their burrito but it was great! In my opinion, the freshly made tortillas and fresh meat makes their burritos much better than Qdoba and Chipotle.

 I experienced the fireworks dinner cruise package on July 26, it was something I booked a couple months in advance for my birthday weekend. I highly recommend any kind of cruise for a special occasion. AML does brunch, dinner, overnights or simple sightseeing cruises and this was a very fun, original idea. The boarding time on my ticket was for 6:45 but I arrived around 5 pm to get a window table since it's first come first serve. Because there was a line forming well before departure, they let us in around 6. AML cruises seem to cater to an older crowd, probably because of the price point, there were mostly middle aged/retired folks on board. We are a couple in our mid twenties and were the youngest people there! The buffet dinner I chose was already ready for us once we got seated, food was as described on the menu, I really liked the sliced beef and veal tortellini- drinks are not included, soda or juice was 3.50$ with no refills and you'd have to tip on top of that. Maybe because we weren't paying for any extras, the service was slow - our server was inattentive to our needs and we constantly had to flag her down for water refills. Our dining room was on the bottom level of the Louis Jolliet ship, loved the huge windows and ambiance lights, everything was decorated nicely. We had some great views and just cruising on the river was a very relaxing/romantic setting. The floor is designed at a slant though so it can be uncomfortable depending on where you are sitting. You are free to leave your table and get some air on the upper decks but there is no guarantee that you will get the same spot when you come back as servers clear the table and re-set it. If you want more action, one of the decks had a dance floor, bar and DJ. I recommend leaving for no more than half hour periods or so and leave an article of clothing or something on the table to signal that it is occupied. Once the fireworks come along, everyone is gathered on the top deck, there are some comfy sofas and seats to lounge on - get there the earlier the better because it does get packed. Tip: when going down the exterior stairs on the ship, best to walk sideways, they are extremely steep and narrow, I ended up scraping the back of my ankles on the gritty sandpaper non-slip strips. Ouch! In all, if you like beautiful settings, a little glitz and glamour of going away on a 4 hour dinner cruise- this is for you. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My Sister recommended Aveda to me awhile ago. She always told me such good things about it. Groupon had a deal for the school so i decided now was a good time to try it, i didnt have much to lose right? To This date ive been to the school around 7 times and each time has been wonderful!!! ""Manny"" was the first student i had there. He was funny, witty, and gave me confidence that he knew what he was doing with my hair. I had allover color done with some highlights and peek a boo's. I loved every moment i spent there. Music playing and good vibes in the air. I walked out feeling amazing! Next visit More highlights and a mani and pedi. Once again awesome experience, great vibes, professional students, great instructors who made themselves readily available. Kelsey is an amazing instructor who really knows her colors and cuts. She has looked at my hair each and every time ive been there and made recommendations about what color should be done. Plus I look forward to seeing her style and what new hair color or cut she has had done! Amazing!!!! When you go you need to have some time on your hands. These are students and they want to do their best which might take a little bit more time then if they were seasoned stylists. But they will give you a aromatherapy massage, facial or hand massage with plenty of flavored water or tea. Also I reccomend being open and relaxed when dealing with the students, if they sense you are tense or think they dont know what they are doing it will not help them do their job or build their confidence. :) Thumbs wayyyyy up aveda!!!!

 A few years ago I had scheduled a haircut with master stylist Brandon. It cost me about $100 plus tip. I had never paid so much for a haircut before so I expected amazing results but to me it was ""eh"". I never returned again and would not reccommend because it was nothing special to me at all and could have gone somewhere else for a lot less. I really like to try different places for haircuts. I kind of got bored of my stylist so I decied to Kelly Cardenas Salon once more but with someone else. I didn't know who so I had just called the salon and they chose Jen for me stating that she was awesome at haircuts. Her cuts were $55. Yes the shampoo room is always amazing, but that was the only thing good about this whole experience. Never returning again! I got a trim which was barely a trim. Then she started to blow dry my hair as another guy came by to help out with the drying and I realized it was Brandon! Jen left the rest of the blow drying to Brandon while she went to start another haircut with someone else. My hair was blowed dried to the crisp and on top Brandon started to flat iron my hair strand by strand while i would see my hair smoking, when he got to the tips of my hair with the iron it would pull my hair like crazy. He said that was to seal the cuticles. Waste of my money and time. I probably have to get a real trim next week. I told them my hair was thinning and looked thin so why the hell would you flat iron??? I'm sorry but its a shame to call them experts. Stylist Jenn finally came back after finishing cutting someone's hair to my flat ironed head and said ""it looks so much healthier"" really?? I could have done this myself at home instead of paying $55 plus tip. I'm so unhappy because I wasted my money on nothing. I wish I had the personality to complain but I'm the one who just never returns!! I basically went in with long hair and came out with longer hair from all the flat ironing!! uggh!! complete fail and my hair is more dry and damaged from all the heat!!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 The Skinny: great pita bread and hummus, everything else is not so great (3), solid service (2). Khoury's is a Mediterranean restaurant tucked away in a strip mall close to Southern Hills Hospital. We started with an appy of hummus and freshly made pita. This was a delight. Really, half of it is the show of watching the pita lady knead the dough and place it in the woodburning oven. My only gripe is the serving size for hummus is a little small for $6. However, this appetizer alone is worth the trip. I ordered the Khoury's Salad with Chicken and my hubby ordered the gyros plate. (I wanted to try the moussaka but they were out.) The salad was okay - the vegetables were great but there was an overabundance of a bland dressing. The chicken itself was singularly uninteresting. It was cut so small that when cooked, it left the meat too dry. I was expecting something similar to chicken from a kabob placed on top of the salad but I have no idea how they cooked this. My hubby's gyros was ok - the gyros meat was well seasoned. However, the problem lay in the tzatziki sauce. The yogurt was not strained enough, leaving the dressing a little thin for my taste. I also prefer a little more garlic in my tzatziki. The fries served with the sandwiches are homemade - good but not great. Normally, a place like this would get only maybe a 2.5 from me, but the pita bread really put this place over the top. Maybe I ought to have tried a pizza instead. ",0,0,1,0,0

 My sweetie has wanted to see the show for quite awhile so we made online reservations before our trip to Vegas, The show itself is a little cheesy, but quite a lot of fun. Lots of audience participation and humor. The food was not much better than a cheap buffet, though the soup was pretty good. The dessert was the best part. We asked ahead of time for the fruit plate rather than the apple turnover thing and I am glad that we did! It was delicious. The service was banquet style, so not a lot of interaction. Overall, it was a fun evening. But a ""been there, done that"" one. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This is a cozy mom and pop's type of place off the strip which has its charm. I'm sad to say I won't be returning, because the food simply was not good. Let's see... what did we order: Filet Mignon Pho. Sounds fancy and awesome, right? It would be if the broth wasn't watered down and the noodles didn't appear to have been soaking for a while. The beef was also overcooked. You can probably get a better bowl of pho at a generic Pho 99, filet mignon or not. Yellow Curry with Chicken. Not much flavor. The curry sauce was watery, kind of like what happens when you cook meat with the lid on and all the juices from the meat waters down the sauce. So I guess the dish was more like Yellow Chicken Juice with Chicken. I can honestly make better curry out of cans at home. Red Curry with Shrimp. Also not much flavor and very watered down. I don't get how people think this is restaurant is worthy of five stars? We also got some random appetizers and everything was average at best. Bland is the word I would use to describe the food here. I really wanted to like this place, but sorry, I just couldn't do it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have previously enjoyed this place but tonight, it was bad...heres the storyHello, We visited your restaurant for our 2nd wedding anniversary, because we have always enjoyed our food and time there. However, tonight was a bit disappointing. My husband spent more than i would have on his dinner, a steak and it showed up on a small plate, with basil or something, that looked old. The steak itself had lots of fat on it he had to trim off himself, and the steak overall did not taste great. This was after waiting about 5 minutes for our server to notice we were not eating because my husbands side dish had not arrived. When she finally brought it over it was plain french fries! Are you kidding me?! For $25.00!!! What a joke. They looked like frozen, out of a bag fries. Secondly our service was pretty bad, we asked for straws, they were pretty much thrown at us, and so was the bottle of ketchup. Wasn't the nice dining experience we were hoping for. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We got off the plane, stepped outside, and the bus was already there loading passengers. Great. We approached the bus and the manager asked us where we were headed. When we told them Monte Carlo, the manager and the driver proceeded to argue (right in front of us) about taking us there. The driver didn't seem to want to go out of his way. You know, to do his job. Mind you, the bus had a total of 6 people on it. Once we got on the bus, the driver announced to the entire bus that he has multiple locations to travel to and he was sorry, but his ""bosses boss"" was forcing him to do so. Unprofessional.

 Was not impressed with the food at all. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which came out barely warm and with almost no BBQ sauce. I had to ask for more sauce. The bun was so wet, like it had been sitting for a while, that I couldn't even pick up the sandwich. I used a fork. I also ordered the sweet potato tots, which I had to send back because they were mushy. Lonnie ordered the fish and chips, which he liked, but wasn't impressed. So far no other place match's Four Peaks when it comes to fish and chips. You really had to search for a reasonable meal, some items were too high for a bar. Wouldn't eat there, but it has a nice atmosphere for drinking, and large tables for groups meeting up. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Very meh. Possibly hyped up due to Yelp reviews... I tried the Chipotle Chicken Avocado, and taste wise, it was just OK. The Chicken Bacon Avocado at Safeway is an upgraded version of it in both taste and portion... and you can always just add some spicier sauce if you want a kick. Also tried the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich. Chicken was slightly dry and overall nothing special. Overall, the portions were small and taste was average. If you compare to Subway, then ya, taste is good... but I've easily had much better sandwiches for the same price. ",0,1,0,0,0

 They need to take out about 4-5 of the tables they have packed in this place - Way to crowded. Not to mention there was a guy singing and playing an accordion on the night we went for dinner. Would have been fine except for the fact that there are 10 people too many in the place to begin with and then he wanders around the dining floor going table to table. Wanted to pay the guy to stop for 30 min while I ate! Pasta dishes are way overpriced and honestly not that great. $20 for noodles and meat sauce... Dinner specials/entrees are your best bet and were very good. but also way over prices. Didn't have desert but multiple people in my dinner party raved about one of the cakes they had. Simply put - this place does not execute the level of food their price points represent. I'm all for paying for a good meal but when it falls short.... and this place does!

The woman at the front desk treated me with respect while getting all her requirements met. She came responded to my call about a party in the next room and quieted them immediately. The real highlight was the breakfast. The woman in charge, Elaine, ran a clean, organized, attractive dining room. The selections were plentiful and the quality was fresh.

I could go on and on about what I ate but honestly, you have to eat them to understand. Just a note: I am a chocoholic so most everything I have ordered has been chocolate. That being said, their caramel is crazy good. They make it themselves and if you can find something with caramel on it, I would recommend it. They know what they are doing and actually put out amazing desserts. The service is fantastic, too. The nice lady behind the counter actually remembered me and made reference to what I had ordered before. Hope they stay in business for a long time... at least as long as I live in the area!

For breakfast the chicken fried steak is one of the best I have ever had. The have fried calamari and a tuna poke stack that is insane. Steak and eggs always on point and you can never go wrong with the burritos for breakfast. Beer is ice cold however only one Stella Challis is frustrating.

 I give 3.5 to 4 stars for food. But for service, it is probably a 2-star or less for me. SERVICE: Being Chinese, I know service is never the forte of an authentic Chinese restaurant. But I was still surprised at the lack of service and the total carelessness and cluelessness there. First, they don't seem to care which table orders what so the orders frequently got mixed up when I was there; the server would carry the food and wander around from table to table, asking if anyone ordered this. So I had to watch the plates whenever the server carried them out from the kitchen and stopped her to give mine to me, because the server was walking AWAY from me with my food on her tray. Second, they started making dumplings 40 minutes after I ordered them. After the dumplings were finally ready, because they forgot who ordered it or simply did not care to check, they let it sit on the side table behind the cashier for another 15 minutes. Our dumplings were finally uncovered when the owner saw the dumplings sitting in the cashier area and started talking loudly in Chinese, ""Whose dumplings are these?"" I had to raise my hand to claim them. So we got our dumplings after we finished our meal and were about to pay the bill. Third, it was difficult to get hold of a server/owner to ask if the dish was coming out anytime soon. They rushed by your table and never made any eye contact. They don't come by your table and fill your water diligently, or check on your order. The owner was especially warm and hospitable to her acquainted clientele when I was there, but was quite indifferent to others (I guess I shouldn't be surprised how they selectively treat people... in the Chinese way). FOOD: In terms of food, I don't have major complaints. The food was good, quite authentic, and fairly priced. But if you ask me to compare Chou's Kitchen to the street food I had growing up in China, Chou's does not come close in taste and quality. We ordered (1) Spicy Braised Beef Combination (in Chinese, ""sliced lung by the married couple,"" a dish in chili oil, toasted peanuts, and cilantro with a mixture of beef slices and various beef parts, including stomach--it sounds gross but I dare you to try it). The best dish we got that night. To me, it was not spicy enough because it is traditionally a very hot dish from Sichuan Province. But the flavor was there and I was thrilled to see a dish Chinese restaurants in the U.S. don't normally serve, even though this is a STANDARD appetizer in almost any restaurant in China. (2) Lamb skewer. Pretty disappointed. It has the similar cumin rub as the ones I would buy from the Xinjiang Uyghur vendors on a street cart in China. But the quality of the lamb was so bad and almost inedible: it was predominantly fat and connective tissues, and the very small amount of lean meat was tough and overcooked. (3) Fried beef buns (in Chinese, ""water-fried beef buns""). So-so. Too much dough for my liking and too little filling. Also, not juicy enough. (4) Soybean Paste Noodle (a soupless ""mix-it-yourself"" cold noodle with cubed ham, sliced cucumber, and a soybean meat sauce). It was extremely basic. The noodle was an alkaline noodle, so it was yellower and more elastic than the average soup noodles. It was a filling dish, but nothing special, and quite bland. (5) Dumplings with Pork and Napa Cabbage. Yes these are the dumplings that came grossly late so we had to box all of them. For 5 bucks they were great, much better than the ones from the frozen section at a Chinese grocery store. But they were NOT worth the 1.5+ hour wait. I would recommend this dish to people who like homemade Chinese dumplings because they are delicious, not because they are the watery relatives of potstickers. But if they don't come at the end of your meal, you should probably cancel the order. All in all, it was a decent Chinese eatery with some management/service issues. I saw some items on the menu that I don't usually see elsewhere and they are quite good. But still, these are basic, entry-level Chinese food items that are quick to prepare and hard to mess up. I would probably come back and hope to see an improvement in the structureless service. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Customer service is lacking at this location. The guy on the phone put me on hold and forgot to mute the phone or actually put it on hold. I heard the whole conversation with his buddy and other customers. Besides the ridiculously low trade in value they give you here (which is expected) the service is terrible. I won't go In here unless I absolutely have to actually no I rather go to Walmart (and that tells you a lot). I bought a new game but received an opened copy in a envelope sleeve. And I asked why that was and he said it was because they needed empty display cases. I told him I wanted a new one that was sealed and said he couldn't give me a sealed one. I asked him if the new copies came with any downloadable content he said he didn't no but most likely no. I should of left and spent my money else where. Lucky for them I was in a hurry.

 I'm disappointed. I've practiced Bikram but this was my first time at this studio. There are a few things I totally expected: carpeted floors (not uncommon), sweltering heat (fully expected), and the smell of sweat (you can't avoid it). I'm familiar with the odor that permeates the Bikram studios but the stench at this particular studio was AWFUL! When was the last time they cleaned the carpets? Why are there tiny bugs crawling on the floor? My former studio definitely had a smell but it was nothing like this. A few other things I was disappointed with - I know people are afraid of the strictness that's associated with Bikram but there are definitely a few ""ground rules"" that I appreciate. This particular studio didn't set those rules and I was really disappointed by that. 1. students new to Bikram were allowed to practice in the front row. When I first started Bikram, I was politely asked to stand at the back of the room so I could learn from someone in the front row with more experience and so my wiggling and moving wouldn't distract everyone else. Now I understand the importance of this. 2. they didn't explain at the start of class the importance of following ONLY the poses that the teacher instructed. Some guy was doing sit-ups?? 3. They didn't ask people to sit silently through class if they were tired. People were walking in and out of the room throughout class. This is NOT one of those easy, relaxing yoga classes that one might expect. It's often referred to as ""Bikram's torture chamber"" and for good reason. I just want to practice in a studio where everyone has the same goal in mind (to heal the body and to build an energy with everyone else in the room). What I did like about the studio - there was plenty of seating outside the room to relax and prepare your mind for class. The teacher was great. She was calm and encouraging. The class was actually less crowded than some I've been to although I'm sure that won't always be true. And most of the people in class were very respectful and focused which definitely helped the energy. I bought the LivingSocial deal and so I'll complete my 20 classes but I may try another studio at the end of it. I was really excited to start Bikram in a new city, as I just moved to Phoenix, but I'm just disappointed with my experience at this studio. ",0,1,0,0,0

The veggie melt was overflowing with cheese and the bread it came w was drenched in butter/oil for sureee I also got the sweet potato mash which was ok. Overall, definitely a super heavy heavy meal. My friend and I felt like we had to go work out right afterwards. But a cute place with a nice homey atmosphere. Go if you don't mind some heavy heavy food. ",0,0,1,0,0

 While staying at the Westin, we decided to have breakfast here since it was close. The wait for our party of 5 was about 20 minutes. When it was our turn, the hostess called our name and so we followed her into the restaurant (we had been waiting outside)...we stood at the front area while she told us to wait just a moment as they were getting our table ready. As we stood there for a couple of minutes, another hostess came up and pretty much scolded us telling us that we needed to wait outside instead of blocking the register area while our table was getting cleared. That was rude. I ordered the fancy scramble which wasn't all that fancy. They were scrambled eggs with a slice of brie and a dollop of fig splatted on top. I could've done that myself at home. My BIL ordered the huevos rancheros which he stated was pretty good. The kids had the silver dollar pancakes which they devoured. Unfortunately I can't remember what my hubs and SIL ordered - which means it must not have been that memorable. Our server was pretty good though and she was attentive. Coffee and waters were refilled promptly. I probably would not come here again unless majority ruled. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've eaten here many times over the past few months and I have always been amazed. With the addition of their new Chef comes a whole new experience you wouldn't expect from a 'pizza place'; but this is so much more. Every night they have a special menu available and prepared by the Chef himself. Having ate at all of the best restaurants in the Valley; I can tell you this Chef knows his stuff. The seafood he prepares is amazing and Debbie (The owner) always has some amazing wines available to pair perfectly with the dish. You'll find true Italian dishes and some amazing 'New American' offerings as well. The service and atmosphere are always relaxing yet, refined. If this place were in Scottsdale, I'd expect to pay 60-80 per dish; but it's not. So the prices for the quality of food you get are such an amazing deal. The staff is always willing to do whatever they can to accommodate you in anything that you want. If you're in the Chandler area, go try this place, it's well worth it! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Tried to use no stars but wouldn't let me. 4 min wait after we were seated and the place is only 1/2 full. The worst part: they stopped selling Mountain Dew! Never coming back, bad service, high price, and no Mountain Dew. The pizza is not much better than the frozen and it's way quicker to run to the store and cook it than waiting in the restaurant!

 I ate here five years or so ago and it wasn't the worst slophouse in Vegas, but it was close. It's gone up a notch or so, but I'd still rather go to Bellagio or Wynn if I absolutely must stay on the strip. Best in town (IMHO) is GVR. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Stayed here during a business trip, but as a fourth choice since the first three were completely booked. There was a reason why this was a fourth choice... Accommodation - It's a rather older and lower-end hotel in the Charlotte area. As the other reviewer said, it's on the fringes of downtown. Other patrons seem to be mostly flight crew and some convention stayers. Rooms were clean and made-to, but just not at the rate they were charging, which was not too much lower (I think) than the newer hotels with better locations. Service - I was turned off by the check-in process. During my check-in, the man was joking around with me and didn't address my question about what rooms were available. Upon finding out that a colleague had checked into a renovated room, I made a similar request, only to be told those weren't available. I understand that rooms get booked, but this process seemed to me a lack of professionalism. ",0,1,0,0,0

 About 15 years ago, the owner would sell pocket sandwiches to people sitting in traffic along 2nd ave. I tried one of these and it was excellent: a good combination of fresh baked bread, meat, spices, etc. I've stopped by a few times since, but you never really know what will be served, or if the place is even open. This is truly a one man operation, and definitely an experience in dining. So yes, make your reservation, bring a bottle of Hungarian Bull's Blood wine, and enjoy authentic Hungarian cooking and a social experience. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Good chips and salsa is about all the positive I have to say about Manuel's on this visit. The food quality was lacking - oversalted and grisley steak, greasy quesadilla my daughter rung out before eating and wilted lettuce strewn about the plates. All of the prices are REALLY high for the quality of the food and it seems like there are NO more affordable options. Even the kids menu is high ($5.50 plus extra for juice) and their emphatic NO SUBSTITUTIONS is frustrating. The happy hour menu looks more promising but for a Family, it's a NO THANK YOU. Sadly we won't be back to Manuel's any time soon. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Love Love Love Mario Batali's Enoteca Italian restaurant in the shoppes area of Venetian. Thought I'd try this restaurant at the Palazzo. Nice decor certainly fitting a steakhouse. Prices are pretty standard to high compared to most premium steakhouses. Wine by the bottle is psycho, glasses start at @ $18 each. Starters: prosciutto sliced soooo thin you could see through it. Served with 3 tiny pieces of melon smaller than my little finger. Nice presentation though and enough proscuitto ($29.00). One of the specials was lobster raviloi but they were sold out and substituted for braised short rib ravioli. Excellent flavor - served in a butter herb sauce. 3 ravs also around $29.00. Entrees: Osso bucco perfectly cooked, topped with a little bit of gremelata, and a small portion of risotto. Could have made a meal on the risotto, it was very al dente, a little lemony and did not look like it was arborio rice either but it was good. I think my osso bucco is better however. Another entree was the simple 8oz petite filet cooked medium rare. It was a very odd looking piece of meat. When it came sitting in the middle of a huge white plate it didn't even look real. It had no aroma or evidence of being cooked as in just off the grill. It was dull. Cutting into it, there was absolutely no juice. Weird. But, still delicious and tender. Can't explain that. Hmmmm, $45.00 for the filet, $39.00 for the osso bucco. Didn't really get the connection off the menu to Mario Batali's great Italian works. But if you go, bring your credit card or lots of money. Small portions, big prices, but still good. Additionally, your waiter will give you all the day's additions to the menu which are numerous. ",0,0,1,0,0

 My husband and I went here on a Wednesday evening around 6 p.m. The restaurant was fairly busy with both dine-in customers and a to-go line. They also seemed understaffed, and worst of all, the waiters use iPads to take your order, which seemed to be more of a burden for them than a time-saver. Our waiter seemed like he cared but was overwhelmed. Some other members of the staff, however, seemed the opposite. Part of the reason we tried this Indian restaurant was because it has a full bar. Unfortunately, simple mixed drinks took between 10-15 minutes to arrive at our table. I would not recommend ordering any of the more elaborate drinks on the menu because the wait time would probably be even longer. We ordered naan, an appetizer, and two entrees. They brought out the naan first, then 10-15 minutes later, only one entree. Then we waited about ten minutes for the second entree. Thankfully, we were sharing both things, or this would've been way awkward. At this point, we still hadn't received our appetizer, so we asked the waiter to please cancel it. The food was actually quite great. We ordered the Chef's special lamb kabob and the Vertical Vindaloo with chicken thigh, and they were both excellent. The vindaloo was not saucy enough for my liking, and the ""Full"" size was rather small for the price. Other than that, we weren't disappointed by the actual food, despite its strange delivery times.

 Came here to grab some coffee and a cookie before heading over to the Panda show that's right next to this cafe. We came here today on July 4th around 7pm and this cafe was quite busy. It took nearly 20 min before we got our regular coffee. This is something that should've taken no longer than 5 minutes but there were only 2 people working at the time. They did their best to work as fast as they possible can but there were too many customers and we were getting frustrated. Our show was going to start at 7:30pm and we were very worried because it took forever to get our drinks. I noticed customers yelling and showing their frustration to the cashier and the lady making the drinks. These customers also had a show to catch and service was unacceptably slow. I couldn't believe why management didn't have more people working here on a holiday weekend. Both the coffee and chocolate chip cookie was delicious. I liked how the cookie was soft and had bits of walnut with just the right amount of chocolate chips. 5 stars for my order. 5 stars and two thumbs up to the two people working there tonight. 0 stars to the Grand Lux management!

 Azure is a chill, hip pool area on the Palazzo hotel grounds for people ages 21+. My girlfriend was offered an 'invite' by one of the Azure workers as she was about to go to one of the Palazzo's family friendly pools. We made a detour and met up with her at Azure. For two twenty/early thirty something couples without children who want to enjoy upbeat tunes and sunshine, and have poolside food and drinks sans screaming kids and overcrowded pools, Azure was a good option for us. We were seated at the lounge chairs where there is a food and/or drink minimum of $50.00/person, which is relatively easy to attain on The Strip. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Third time here in 4 years. Don't plan to come back. Worst brew pub in area. Asian noodle bowl tasted like water, no flavor at all. Medium rare (some pink) curd burger was served well done despite having the med/rare skewer in it. Burger didn't have much taste either and was pretty pricey for what you got. Fries were pretty boring. Quesadillas went uneaten, meh. Cheese curds were at best average. The soft pretzels were awesome and the beers are really good! Love the atmosphere!

 Otro easily had the best food overall of any restaurant I've been to since I've been in Phoenix (granted only 2.5 months, but we've eaten out a lot!). We started with an order of guac to share in addition to the salsa verde and spicy salsa that I think comes with each meal. I could drink the salsa verde, and the spicy salsa was also very good. The guacamole was like what I'd make at home (so amazing:). Chips weren't out of this world but they were decent. I ordered the Naco Torta which was delicious! My friend hates eggs and didn't want to try it even with the eggs removed, but I convinced him and he downed an entire half (which is gargantuan) in a few minutes. He had the pancakes - sooooo good. Another friend had the chicken soup which she thought was a bit too salty but liked. I also liked the dark wood for the booths and the atmosphere. I've been to Gallo too (same owner) and liked it, but thought the service was better at Otro and the lack of a wait was a nice bonus. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I think their delivery service is pretty good, it was quick and the delivery guy was friendly. And the lady I ordered my pizza through was VERY friendly and upbeat. I've heard a lot of bad things about their workers? But I always go around noon so maybe those people are just going at the wrong time. Who knows! Now onto the food. Their pizza isn't the best pizza you'll ever have, but for the price it's good. It's a little greasy sometimes, I'll admit. But honestly I get the craving for them sometime! They have great cheese to put on their pizzas, and they usually put a good amount on. And I love their breadsticks! Yum! Like I said though, there is better. But if you're looking for cheap, quick, decent pizza I'd go here. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Absolutely LOVE Nail Haven! My girlfriend and I visit monthly for our pedicures. They have an awesome membership plan for $15 a month and you get a free pedicure, plus 10% off any other services. They are the BEST pedicures with hot rocks and everything. They take their time as well. I don't know about you, but when I'm getting a pedicure, I want to relax, and I love that they don't rush you through it. I really don't understand why there is such a negative review on here, but I guess everyone has different experiences.

 Wow. Probably one of the worst experiences I have ever had with local retail. For those of you just looking for a quick review, the owner was condescending and deliberately tried to mislead me. I brought in 3 pipes to be reamed and sterilized. and when I got them back the insides were still flithy. When I confronted him, he tried to convince me that you can't clean the insides. It ended with me telling him he lost a customer. For the full story read below. I'm new to pipe smoking and have been frequenting several of Phoenix's local tobacco shops looking for a new pipe and place I can call my own. When I first went to Ye olde pipe things were pleasant enough, it was just before closing and a young cigar smoking kid approached my wife and I with a big smile and offered to let us see any of the pipes we wanted. I was ready to impulse buy and he suggested I take my time and come in later and talk to a regular customer of theirs who knew everything there was to know about pipes. I was pretty excited about how cool the store seemed and that they were really invested in developing regular customers. I found a few estate pipes at an antique store and went back to ye olde pipe to buy some cleaning supplies. The kid was there with another man and they suggested I just have the shop clean them for me and that it would be about $5 a pipe. I came in the next day and the owner was at the counter. I showed him my pipes and he said it would be $10 a pipe. More than what I was quoted, but 10 bucks seemed reasonable. I asked what the cleaning entailed and he said they reamed the bowl, cleaned and sterilized the shank and polished the outside. I gave him my pipes and came back a few days later. The shanks looked a lot better and the bowls seemed a bit cleaner, but when I separated the shank from the bowl, the insides were still full of gunk. I showed it to him and he grumbled something about it just being cleaning supply residue and he put a pipe cleaner through it and said it was fine. I double checked to make sure the whole thing was sterilized as I had no idea where the pipe was before. He said yes, I bought some tobacco and a pouch and dropped him 50 bucks when I checked out. When I got home and examined the pipes under light I realized the shanks were just as filthy as when I brought them in. When I ran a pipe cleaner with a bit of alcohol on it though the pipe it came out brown with a single pass. I took the pipes back and asked him if they passed as clean to him? He shrugged me aside and said yes, they looked fine, what was my problem? Since he refused to acknowledge the visible gunk in the shaft I gave him a pipe cleaner with alcohol to pass through it. When it came out brown he began to defend himself by saying you can never get everything out. As he put more cleaners through it and they came out browner and browner he began to concede a little that maybe it could use another pass, but that I only paid $10 bucks a pipe so what did I expect? A full restoration would cost $40-50. All of this was explained to me with a condescending air as if I was too young and stupid to know anything about a clean pipe.I told him I expected a clean and sterile pipe and that he never mentioned that I would need to spend $40.00 to have it actually cleaned. I then asked if he really believed the pipes were clean to his standards, he said yes. I then told him that he could give me my pipe back (which he was still pulling brown pipe cleaners out of) and that I didn't appreciate his condescending attitude. I then told him he lost a customer. He responded with 'get out, and don't ever come back.' I don't intend to. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I am so very lucky to have F&E on my corner! My neighbor works there and is always bringing us goodies and coupons. It's perfect when we need to just ""run to the store real fast"". I love their meats but I do find the produce pricy and to be honest... sometimes I just don't need 3 zuchini. They carry just about everything I need on a weekly basis. The prepackaged meals are decent but 99% of the time I'd rather cook my own. I grab them if I know time will be short for dinner that night or whatever. All of the F&E brand packaged foods and drinks I have tried have been great. The peanutbutter granola bars... wow. =) The drinks are awesome *ahem* mango lemonade! They also cary a variety of major name brand stuff as well. They have a decent wine selection with fun stuff to try on a regular basis. It's always clean, the staff is always friendly and helpful. It's self check out but the majority of the time some one will come and scan or bag for you... sometimes you get both! This place makes me smile. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Something's were appealing, like ground beef for $1.88 lb in what appeared to be a 10lb roll. That's a bargain I can't find anywhere else. The bulk items are kind of a turn off. Here I'm thinking people are sticking their hands in to nosh on a few goodies and sure enough, some guy sticks his hand in and pulls out two gummy candies. Clearly he is mentally challenged and couldn't read the ""DO NOT...."" sign that's applied to every few barrels. I was surprised by the variety of products they carry. There was what appeared to be a massive selection of coffee on the wall but I didn't get a close up view. I picked up some Greek yogurt, Bolthouse Farms beverage, Kefir, and a couple other items which were priced much lower than any of the other Valley grocery stores. Not knowing the types of meat cuts and prices I couldn't compare WinCo to any of the area grocery stores. Overall feeling, I am not going out of my way to shop here.

 I came her last weekend with two other guests. I'm basing my rating on the average of our three scores... We all really wanted to like this place. It started off great! The chips and salsa they bring to the table are delicious and addicting. I was excited to order the fresh guacamole but then it started going downhill. I only had one bite of the guacamole - I thought it tasted nasty. One of my guests had only one bite while the other guests took out the grilled jalepenos that were mixed in it and found it to be ""ok"". On to entrees....one guest ordered a chicken burrito that was ""ok""- It was swimming in this creme sauce that he tried taking off. The waitress kept stressing that she recommended the tacos - I should've listened to her! My other guest ordered tacos and they looked nice and fresh. I ordered off the brunch menu and got the omelet with potatoes and these cinnamon fried bananas. The bananas were good but the omelet was dripping with oil! And the potatoes had a REALLY WEIRD taste to them - they were uneatable! Ewwwww. I mentioned this to the waitress with the suggestion that the chef taste the batch being served (I didn't want anyone getting sick from them) and she just smiled and said ok. Once we asked for our check it took 20 minutes to get it... They weren't busy. Maybe understaffed? I paid the check and I have no plans of returning. I can get way better food thats edible at the Suncoast cafe across the street- and still have money left to play wheel of fortune! My other guest said they would never return again either, while the other said he would just come for a drink and a taco appetizer. Bummer..... ",0,1,0,0,0

For the price of $55/night was decent and free wifi in my room something that i have not found in other casinos on the strip like the excalibur. Don't expect to walk to the strip from this location.

 Some things are better than others and if you choose the right dish you won't be disappointed. This is not ""American"" Italian food so if you like Olive Garden, this place isn't for you. Two appetizers to knock your socks off - the Carpaccio, and Polipo Con Patate! Yeah, you have to like raw beef for one and octopus for the other, but you are in Vegas baby, try something different. Delicious Cioppino (Tuscan-style fish soup with monkfish, seabass, mussels, clams, scallops, prawns, tomato and herbs). Very good Fiadoni Di Pietro (salmon stuffed spinach ravioli) - the saffron sauce was awesome. Well - obviously I like Italian seafood.

 Had an office lunch here last week and boy was I impressed. The first thing I always look at - even when I am not drinking - is the cocktail list. If a place cares about their cocktails, then they must care about their food. This is, I think, the first place in Scottsdale I have seen a cocktail (actually several) listing Absinthe on its list. Boom - I am impressed. Plus all these beauties are actually included in the happy hour deal - not like some places where you get the crappy Sky vodka or Absolute cosmo for 5 bucks but the better drinks are still 12. Anyway - love them for that. The place is super cool, I love NYC and the huge art on the wall showing central park definitely got me in the mood. The bathroom even smelled like the tropics - I felt wierd coming back t the table and saying to my work mate - ""oh my god, you have to go to the bathroom - it smells so good in there!"" ha ha!! I had the blackened salmon salad - forget the menu name. A touch over cooked, more on the side of full medium as opposed to medium rare, but the salad dressing (passion fruit) was lovely. The beet chips are amazing for sure. I definitely want to go back for happy hour and try that black truffle hummus and a fun cocktail! So far my favorite place tof all the new joints in the Quarter.

We were near the restaurant so we went to the host stand to make reservations for the next day.

 Our family read about this great event and decided to give it a try - sounded fun! We purchased our tickets the day before which was a good thing because they were sold out. We arrived at 530 pm and there was ample parking. We headed to the gate and entered in the e-ticket line where I had to hear about how frustrating it was to scan the phone (then don't take e-tickets!). The lady at the front gate handing out maps was super friendly and really took time to make our 2 year old feel welcome and even got him a little wrist band like the rest of us had. We entered and people were just standing around. This was the theme for the night - lack of movement. We headed down the trails and it felt like I was a rat in a maze just looking for my way out. The trails were so congested that it was hard to move and to pull the little wagon I had the kiddos in. At first I felt bad about clogging up the narrow trails with my wagon but (1) it was better than letting them run loose and burning down the whole place or burning themselves and (2) the large scooters that were being rented out took up more room than my wagon. This was, in my opinion, not a very kid friendly event. My 4 year old kept asking why we had taken them there and after about 10 minutes I was wondering the same. There was live music but that still wasn't enough to bring up the star rating. The stations to purchase beverages were nice but also blocking access to getting around. I will agree with others that it is a beautiful thing to see -- but I would not go back - ever. The $30 price tag is way too steep for what this is. In New Mexico there is a shuttle tour that takes you through neighborhoods that decorate with luminarias and that is $3. Would I return? No way. ",1,0,0,0,0

After we got our coffee, it took a full 30 minutes for our not so friendly waitress to take our order. When we finally did get our order, we had to request coffee refills and ask for pancake syrup.

 Variety is lacking....Vegas buffet. $32 on Sundays. Includes decent Wycliff champagne. We asked for the extra orange juice to make mimosas Great small village decor. Americanized french food. Hearty meats for ya'll meat lovers. Very good crepes. The food is pretty rich. Potatoes Au Gratin was great. We prefer an overall healthier mixture of food though. Veg options were pretty low. Salad fixings were basic. I recommend the Belagio Buffet the best! $20 for lunch. Diverse food and elegant experience. ",0,0,1,0,0

 In a sea of wildly overpriced tourist trap restaurants in Old Montreal, this one manages to serve some reasonably priced Italian food! The menu and the decor is by no means cutting edge stuff or that attractive but both serve their purpose. The table d'hote would give you a lot of bang for you buck with a starter plus coffee or tea, but nothing caught my eye on that separate menu. I ordered some linguine with a rose sauce, mushrooms and green onions, substituting chicken for the prosciutto. Our wonderful server loaded me up with fresh grated Parmesan cheese and black pepper. It was a decent meal, the chicken had a bit of a strange texture to it but the sauce was beautiful. I couldn't help mopping up every last drop with the bread basket. What really made this place and this experience was our server. I can only hope you are lucky enough to have her too! She did not look down I my substitution, was timely with everything, so sweet, gave us directions and separate bills? No problem! Everyone enjoyed themselves and their meals. Go here for a less pricey, homey bite in this area. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Beware - Food Baby On Board! Why do I take an All You Can Eat menu as a personal challenge? I went yesterday with 2 friends for late lunch/early dinner. We had planned on Ichi Ban at Central and Thomas for the proximity to our houses, but they didn't open till 5. They'd been to Sushi Q before, and suggested it. They did not tell me about the AYCE menu! $25.95 with a decent selection of apps, nigiri and rolls. I wasn't doing to do it. I was going to order from the regular menu. I chose 3 rolls (soft shell crab, tootsie and I don't remember the third) - when I figured the price, I realized I was just a couple bucks shy of the AYCE price. So, if I ordered just one more item, it would be more cost effective to go the AYCE route. What was I thinking? Three rolls is PLENTY! Ordered - soft shell crab, tootsie and summer (spicy crab roll with spicy tuna on top) to start - with the plan of doing a round 2. Ate - all of mine, plus helped one of my companions finish her summer roll. It was TOO MUCH FOOD! For my appetite, the AYCE is a waste of money. I should have done a miso soup and two rolls - that would have been perfect for me. Dining companion M should have also ordered from the regular menu. We would have been fine if we didn't have to help her. Dining companion D made the AYCE well worth it - he was the only one it ended up making sense for. All rolls were fresh and tasty. D cannot have any seeds, the sushi chef was happy to make adjustments accordingly. Oh, and M hates avocado - he was also happy to oblige her. Good to know they will make substitutions, even on an AYCE menu! The lady next to me had a seaweed salad that looked awesome and very fresh - and her salmon sashimi was gorgeous! Clean place, friendly staff, fair prices. I love strip mall sushi! Places like this, you know you're paying for the food - not the address and state of the art decor. (Why I don't go to the ""pretty"" places much - I'd rather spend my cash on the food than the ""see and be seen"" factor!) It wasn't the most amazing sushi in town, but there was nothing wrong with it, and I will gladly be back! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Good beer selection for such a little market, but other than that it has a lot of negatives. The owner and help were kinda of rude, but hey what do you expect from a hole in the wall market. The beer prices are VERY steep compared to the super market. I did notice when I got home that 2 out of the 4 beers I got were pretty old based on the brew date. One of those two beers was skunked (a belgian style blonde). If this is your only option, its not a horrible choice, but if one of the near by SAQs are open, I would go there instead. ",0,0,1,0,0

 So you're calling your would be paying customer, a liar? I walked into your establishment at 7:50pm and your neighbor Tropical Smoothie Caffe can verify that since we walked into their place after you denied us service. Plus, we have a receipt from the IHOP down the street posting our order at 8:15pm so how can we be at two places at once or why would we leave a full service restaurant and arrive to your place ten minutes before closing? I am not the only one that has posted a bad review about your ""convenient"" hours so if situations like this happened more than once then you should rethink and recalibrate your customer servicing, store hours and work ethic.

 The deli/bistro in this store is awful. Customer service is non-existent. I have been here on many occasions because I work close by and every time I get helped juuuuuust as I consider leaving empty handed because I've waited so long while being ignored. The first really bad trip was for breakfast. When I finally got helped, I ordered a number 1 from the sign. She said ""well what do you want in it?"" I said...""whatever the sign said was in a number 1."" She replied that she didn't know, and couldn't see the sign so I should just tell her what I want. So, I chose a few items I saw in the hot case. She charged extra for biscuits & gravy...you'd THINK that if she knew those didn't come with a number 1, that must mean she has SOME idea what DOES. As she scooped my food, she proceeded to talk to a co-worker saying ""I don't even know why we MAKE breakfast anymore. Nobody buys it. It just sits around & gets old, then we throw it all away."" That's just what I like to hear when I'm buying some of it, right? When I got to work with my breakfast I found that she was right on the money: potatoes overdone and dried out, biscuits & gravy was gross, & eggs were crusty/dry and old. My last trip was the final straw. I stood in line behind 1 man. After he was helped, the woman completely ignored me, walked over to another part of the counter, helped a lady there, then proceeded to chat with her about some guy they both know, the day they are having, etc... I waited until they were finished socializing. She finally came back, looked at me, then looked at the man off to the side BEHIND me, and asked if he had been helped. He said he was just waiting. So finally she asked if I had been helped. Uhhh...well lady, you're the ONLY one helping people and you have helped everyone BUT me including people behind me, so NOOOOOO...I have not. I got a single slice of pizza, which was not very fresh. I also stopped by the seafood counter before I left. I thought I might get some Cajun crab dip. I stood there for a while listening to the seafood lady chat with a customer about how the government sucks and the economy is bad...finally I left with no dip. It is my understanding that Bashas used to be the only store in town. They must still think they are because they certainly don't act like there is any competition. Unfortunately for them. there are lots of other stores that I am more than willing to drive a little extra to get to from now on to avoid the crappy customer service here. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Brunch was excellent with some of the best potatoes I've ever had. The chorizo and eggs were great. And the farmbread and apple butter..delicious. If I was rating on brunch alone, easily 5 stars. Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by lunch and even more so by dinner, hence only 3 stars. If you are looking for a brunch spot with wonderful outside dining where you are not haveing to suck car exhaust fumes, give Porch a shot. I think the outdoor dining may be the best in the city.

 Moved in the first of the year and thought we found the perfect place to start our new life in the Las Vegas area while we looked for a home to purchase. Nice complex, nice units, a little on the pricey side but we felt like it was a good safe start until we got familiar with Nevada. It wasn't long before we realized that many of the tenants in the complex with pets do not clean up their animal's waste even though the complex provides stations with bags. We brought this to management's attention in January and again in February. After complaining yet again in March we have been told by management that this is common among complexes that allow pets and it is impossible to enforce the complex rules regarding this matter. We knew moving from a home of 20 years to an apartment there would be some adjustments and differences to get used to, but we never imagined animal waste would be one of them. We thought it was nice that apartments allowed pets, they didn't back in our day when we were renters, and had no idea such problems existed. Not sure which is more frustrating management that admits it can't enforce its own rules or people with such lack of consideration for their neighbors. If you don't mind neighbors who leave animal waste, the flies and other problems it creates, then this place is perfect. Being new to the state our experience here has not left a very good first impression of the area or its residents. Needless to say we will not renew our lease and cannot wait to get out of this complex. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I'm always able to stay here for free due to my Harrah's total rewards card, and some trips, it's totally necessary. We were placed in a Deluxe Love Tub room, complete with a large hot tub across the room from the bed, and mirrors above the tub and bed. Creepy. The room itself was a decent size and the bed was comfortable. It was one of the nicer IP rooms I've stayed in, and it looks like there's been some minor upgrades. This visit was just fine. I enjoy Imperial Palace's central location on the strip, it's so easy to go and hang out/gamble in the other awesome Harrah's properties. The casino itself is tiny and it's hard to breathe in it due to the cigar and cigarette smoke. Losing a lot of money here will make you reconsider living. Seriously, go elsewhere! At least you'll be broke in a nicer place! :) IMPERIAL PALACE, PLEASE RENOVATE AND UPDATE YOURSELF! It's so sad here! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've been meaning to come back to this place for a while now after discovering it through a Yelp Elite event some time ago. I finally had the time, so I jetted down to the restaurant and I had a really good time. The service here was great. I was greeted and seated immediately, and decided that lunch was the way to go for me. I like the fact that they serve breakfast here until 2PM, because sometimes I DO want breakfast at noon! They also have happy hour daily from 3-7 which is awesome as well. No need to rush after work. Just do happy hour on a Saturday! Anyways, I went with the burger, and surprisingly, they have a variety of sides to choose from. I ""like"" french fries, but am always looking for something more at times. Sometimes I want a salad instead, or soup, and BLD gives you that choice. Instead of fries, they have 4 or 5 choices to go with. I went with hummus. It was delicious! Nice change of pace from fries. Anyways, its a bit of a drive, but a nice alternative from the ordinary. Lovely decor, spacey with lots of good food to choose from. I will be back! ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place was recommended by a friend. He said it was one of his family's fav spots. I went to check it out with The Better Half and was pleasantly surprised. The food was a little better than ok but just shy of a full 4 Stars, but I'm upgrading to 4 Stars because of the service. They started out with the complimentary Chips & Salsa....they were just ok. Salsa was too runny and bland for my tastes. I prefer it with a thicker consistency and spicier. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ajo-als-scottsdale?select=BVcuBjkGkzOq6aCuT79B3g#BVcuBjkGkzOq6aCuT79B3g ....so I asked for the real deal Spicy Salsa, and they went to the kitchen and brought it out for me, which was awesome. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ajo-als-scottsdale?select=V-gPwFtgugPtMDkWlWITog#V-gPwFtgugPtMDkWlWITog The Better Half ordered the Mushroom Enchiladas, which she absolutely loved.

The music was blaring when we arrived (not sure why on Mother's Day afternoon) but they did turn it down when we asked.

 A little over a year ago we stopped by this hotel one night to gamble and have some drinks. I think the hotel had only been open a few months and was not very busy. We had SO much fun. The ambiance was cool and the hotel/resort wasn't full of itself quite yet. The people that worked there were so nice. We decided next time around we would love to stay there. We recently visited again for my hubby's 30th birthday. First - the place is SO busy... almost too busy to the point where they haven't figured out how to handle it. It took an hour to check in ( we were at the front desk by 3pm) and then another hour until our room was ready. Upon check in we were asked if we wanted to upgrade our wrap around terrace suite with a view of the bellagio fountains for another $175 a night. No thanks, no big deal. Well, after waiting FOREVER for our room and then getting to it, we found that we were staring at a concrete wall on one whole side of our wrapround balcony and on the other side, a parking garage. We did have an OK view of the bellagio and the palms in the far corner. Anyway, I did not pay $650 a night to stare at a concrete wall. I called the front desk and complained and they claimed no one has ever complained about this room. WHAT? REALLY? Who builds a wraparound suite (only one level price wise down from their penthouses) that is completely blocked by a concrete wall? On a high note, we could climb onto the roof from our balcony and actually onto the very top of the hotel. Liability anyone? I gave it up and had some drinks and got over it. I was more angry that they didn't offer a dinner voucher, or something else to make me smile since we paid quite a bit for the room and weren't happy. I may pursue a little further now that I'm home and look for some sort of refund. The room was a good size but was nothing super special. Was more homey & not like a trendy Vegas room. My hubby is in the civil/architectural engineering business and can always tell when the cheaper way out has been taken and he was constantly pointing out things that could have been done better. The bed was really comfy. I've stayed in cooler rooms at The Hard Rock HRH towers, the Encore & the Palazzo. We had a kitchen, but it had absolutely nothing in any of the cabinets. Not a spoon or a fork to be found. Luckily I had done grocery delivery and had some cutlery in my order. I wanted to make cupcakes for a late night snack for my hubby's birthday and I had to use the ice bucket to mix the batter. What made me really angry is that there is NO iPhone/iPod dock. EVERY other room I've ever stayed at in Vegas has had one (complimentary). At the cosmo, they make you pay for a special connector... seriously? They provided Satellite music but I don't feel like listening to the same 20 songs all weekend. I have Spotify on my phone and had made a dance playlist just for this weekend. So lame. The pool was cool. Good drinks, fun ambiance. It was positioned so by the late afternoon when it's the warmest in Vegas, the building completely blocked the sun and so it got pretty cold. Probably during the summer it will be no biggie, since it's always hot. There are pool tables and stuff by the pool and a good sized hot tub for the windy day we were there. I thought the buffet was good, but it was only my second one in Vegas. The guys we were with were disappointed in it and the selection. We ate at Holsteins twice and it was yummy... the shakes were to die for. Overall, it's a nice hotel with really good looking people. Usually when we stay at a hotel we just kind of camp out there the whole weekend.. at the pool or casino or the clubs. The casino was OK, the pool was fun, there was no way we were waiting in the 3 hour line to get into Marquee (or paying the 3K for bottle service to avoid the line). This trip, we were across the street at Planet Hollywood where our friends were staying, at the Wynn/Encore for the clubs and bars there or at the Bellagio. I've stayed at Mandalay, theHotel, Hard Rock, Luxor, Encore, the Palazzo, Monte Carlo and now the Cosmpolitan. I think this is the first time I didn't think I got my money's worth. Maybe we are old or something, but next time we definitely will be staying at the Wynn or Encore. The Cosmo is the ""IN"" place but honestly, I don't think it has the staying power. Give it a couple of years... ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've never been a big fan of Party City and this Party City is no different than any of the others I've been to. The parking lot is pretty crazy though, since there are so many other businesses in the area. It can be a madhouse trying to get here, especially during the lunch hour. The inside is laid out the same as most Party Cities, but I've never memorized this. I still get lost and can't always find what I'm looking for, which can be frustrating. This place seemed dingy, but the lighting wasn't good either. The prices are decent, especially for party items that you know are just going to be thrown away after one use. The employees were really helpful though and I was able to get in and out rather quickly. If I needed anything party related, I'd come back here. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The Cathedral of Learning is perfect. Maybe I am a little biased because I went to Pitt for my undergraduate degree, am currently enrolled as a graduate student for Pitt as well and have lived in Pittsburgh all of my life... But regardless, I love it. The building is gorgeous and is often referred to as Hogwarts- for Pitt students anyway :). The nationality rooms are awesome and so unique! I love taking a look in them and checking out the art and all of the work in general, that has been put into them! There's a secret attic in the American room and I was lucky enough to explore it when I was taking one of my classes as an undergrad. The Cathedral is perfect to study in. Tons of spaces with quiet areas as well as areas for groups to meet. The view from the top is incredible as well!

 Love this grocery store. I usually never shop at Fry's and shop at Safeway, but this is the ONLY Fry's store that I will go to. It's fancy and always has items that you wouldn't normally find in a regular grocery store. We usually only come here though for the pastry department....and the fresh sushi. There's a sushi roll there that we always have to get when we stop by and it never fails us. For some reason, I can't remember the name, but it's basically a california roll with some mayo spicy sauce drizzled on top. The guy who stands there and yells out ""fresh sushi"" could take a break though, his voice is annoying. Anyway, my review here is for the pastry department. We have ordered our sons birthday cake here for the past 2 years....last year they were cupcakes with angry bird rings on top. Delish! This year, we ordered a quarter sheet white cake with whipped cream topping using their Despicable Me theme of Minions on the cake. The cake turned out the exact same way the picture did. We were impressed - and more so, we were so impressed by the taste of the cake. It was so good! Our guests also asked where we purchased the cake. So kudos to the pastry chefs at the Fry's on Shea & Tatum! We'll definitely be coming back. There's also some limited cover parking which is great for those super hot days - but expect to drive around if you're looking for a spot. And they have valet, too, for the super lazy. They also will wash your car for you (for a fee) if you want, while you're shopping. ",0,0,0,0,1

They are willing to help you out and they give you a nice verity of food and items for a little shop they are. I would highly suggest going there, the food is healthier for you and isn't much more than our typical everyday food. They have certainly got me wanting to go back for more. ",0,0,0,0,1

 After moving to Leith, I have been pleasantly surprised to discover that it is not an impoverished, drug-ridden, Trainspotting-esque hellhole as many snooty South Edinburgh types like to imply. As an area, it's actually got a lot going for it. However, the New Kirkgate shopping centre at the foot of Leith Walk does seem to corroborate all those negative stereotypes. This depressing precinct is given over exclusively to cut-price retailers, from Lidl and Farmfoods to Pound Stretcher and the dismal Shoe Zone. There are always chain-smoking unemployed men sitting on the pigeon-daubed benches beside the statue of Queen Victoria, bored teenagers in hoodies idling outside the shops and single mothers in the supermarket bawling at their unruly offspring. In fact, the whole set-up seems to encapsulate the desolate image of 'broken Britain' so often invoked by politicians. It serves as a reminder that, in many ways, the supposed regeneration of Leith is only skin deep. A lot of what makes this shopping centre so dispiriting, however, is not just the fact that everything here is cheap and low quality - after all, it's actually very useful to have somewhere nearby where you can get eight tins of sweetcorn for a pound, or a pair of boots for under a tenner. It's more that it's such an ugly and soulless development, the misguided project of 1960s city planners who ripped out the historic buildings and cobbled marketplace of the original Kirkgate, to replace it with this concrete monstrosity. The Newkirkgate Shopping Centre may seem like an embodiment of social deprivation, but it's worth bearing in mind that it didn't have to be this way ",0,1,0,0,0

 You know you're in Vegas when your hotel has it's own Dolphin and Tiger exhibit. That was pretty cool. The hotel pool is pretty nice for a giant wading pool when it hits 105 degrees. Just crowded as hell though. The hotel/casino itself inside - lots and lots of restaurants (BLT Burger = awesome), a mall, a giant sports-betting area, pretty much everything that any of the other casinos/hotels generally have. I have to say that the location is probably the most outstanding draw to the hotel, with the Bellagio about 3 minutes' walk away. However, for a more authentic-feeling experience in Vegas (if there is such a thing), I say hit up Fremont Street instead of the Strip... ",0,0,1,0,0

 Stayed here for the first time in 8 years. What a surprise. The Hospitality Suites are amazing, customer service amazing, Cravings Buffet outstanding and the pool area is just awesome. Restaurants and service were great, location on strip was perfect. Great improvements and upgrades since our last visit. We stayed for 2 nights then moved over to Mandalay Bay for 3 nights. Wish we would have stayed here all 5 days. Mandalay Bay was a big disappointment. ",0,0,0,0,1

 For those looking for a designer bargain, but would rather not drive the 30 miles to the Scottsdale location, this My Sister's Closet is sometimes the diamond in the rough. Because most of the super nice stuff migrates north, there aren't as many high high end merchandise, however don't let this prevent you from checking it out. I have found many a good deals on Free People, Ella Moss, Rich and Skinny, Paige, etc. If you are in the area don't over look this awesome spot. I just bought a vintage mini-cross body leather D&B for $14! ",0,0,0,1,0

 First time at RnR, met my daughter for lunch. She had been there before so she ordered the Brussels Burger. I went for the Bacon Bleu Burger with Brussels sprouts on the side. Lunch took about 15 minutes to arrive which was surprising with only about 20 folks in the place. My 'medium' burger was definitely well done, as there was zero pink in the middle. The burger comes on a pretzel bun but with no condiments so it needed mayo, which took another 7 minutes. The burger itself was tasty. Decent size but $13 was a bit steep. The sprouts were nicely Caramelized and had Caramelized onions and bacon. Good stuff there. My daughters burger was also over cooked ($15). All in all, they could've done better but I'll try it again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I work for a dealer that partners with Terry's garage in which they service and certify about 1/2 of our fleet, which is over 75+ cars per month. If there were to be a harsher critic when it comes to the auto industry overall it would be me, and I can tell you that the first time I actually used Terry's for my 212,000 mile 1999 4Runner for a simple oil change and break light bulb replacement that didn't even pass the $40 mark, they also washed and vacuumed my Toyota! And picked it up for me and brought it back to me. They are spectacular, and tell you anything your car may need before turning a wrench. Go to Terry's, you WILL NOT regret it!!!

 We walked around the nice restaurant area in MGM Grand and out of them all, this one seemed the most reasonably priced. And it looked a little empty. . . .which was a little concerning but it turned out to be great! It may be because, as the server informed us, they had just did a 180 change on their menu just a couple days ago. (The menu online as of now doesn't reflect the menu we had just 2 days ago) To start, we had a fried ball of cheese and some other goodness. Difficult to describe. . . but it was amazing! I'm sure if you want to order it you can probably just describe to them that you want a fried ball that has alfredo sauce in the middle. We imagined it to be tiny, but the portion was pretty large. For entrees, we had short ribs ravioli which was interesting and delicious. We were expecting about 5 or 6 raviolis, but nope, they gave a plate full and each was stuffed with lots of meat. Yum! And we also ordered the risotto with sea scallops. The risotto was cooked just right, not overly buttery or oily, and was flavorful and not too hard. I'd definitely recommend! :) Total bill for appetizer, 2 entrees, and 1 soft drink after tax and tip was around $75. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Don't take your keys with you. From the company that advertises - We'll pick you up, i found them to be less than accommodating. After being in Vegas for a week, and having one of these new cars that is ""keyless"", when i returned the car, I mistakenly had my keys in my pocket. Did anyone ask me to give them the keys when I returned the car? No, they just let me walk away, go to the shuttle bus, and get all the way to my gate. THEN, i get the call about having taken the car keys. Admittedly, this was my mistake, but Sasha, the manager told me that if I didn't make sure to get the keys back to them that day, i was going to be charged for replacement keys. Could I mail them to them? NO! Could they come get them at the airport? NO! It was fortunate that my flight was delayed and I could leave the airport, but I imagine I'm not the first nor the last person this has happened to. I almost exclusively rent from Enterprise... now I'll pick anyone else but! You'd think that since they run back and forth to the airport that you could just hand the keys to someone at the airport like a lost and found to get them their keys back. The only lucky thing besides having to go on the shuttle back to the rental car place in Vegas, which is a haul, was that i was able to go downstairs to the curb, hand the keys to one of the shuttle drivers and pray that he gave them to Enterprise! I can only imagine if I was unable to get in and out of security to make my flight how much it would have been for replacement keys. And you KNOW that they have another set, but just another way to make money off the customer I guess. So, lesson learned by me... If possible, I'll never rent a keyless car again, unless that's the norm, and secondly, I'll make sure that i check myself for keys on my person. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is horrible. The pharmacy staff is rude, slow, and have actually sent my prescriptions to other pharmacies without my requesting them to do so. Terri S. actually told me today that I would have to drive across town for one they screwed up. When I persisted, she asked me to go outside to the walk up window to give her a chance to call and have it fixed. When I got around to the window, they had put up a ""this window is closed"" sign. Oddly enough, ""Terri S."" was nowhere to be seen either. This is not the first time I have had problems with rude staff at this location, either. Their normal weekday staff ignores customers until they are addressed verbally, and they have a tendency to serve multiple customers out of the same window simultaneously. I would strongly urge anyone considering visiting this location to go elsewhere. Even Walmart has better customer service. I can't believe I just said that, but it is true. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My wife & I stopped by for a drink after eating at the other Hash House. We accidentally went to the wrong place. The other place was good too, but we really want to try this place's food. It was extremely busy here. People were waiting outside to get seated. Once we went inside, we noticed what the hype was all about. All the food portions are huge. Everything looked really good. Too bad we couldn't try the food since we were full. We ended up going to the bar to grab a drink which took for ever. The waitress was really busy trying to keep up with all the orders. She at least acknowledge that we were waiting to be helped. We decided to have a Hash House Bloody Mary. They have a good selection of drinks. The Bloody Mary tasted really good. It was a bit spicy for my taste but I enjoyed. I look forward to stopping by for lunch next time I am in town. The food all looked good!!! Hopefully, it taste good too!!! ",0,0,1,0,0

 HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! My husband and I decided to come here tonight, as he has had this pizza before at work. Big mistake. We walk in and the guy greets us and is very nice. He tells is we can sit anywhere we want, so we do. We look at the menu and wait for someone to come by to get our drink order. Doesn't happen right away, as the guy and girl that seem to be the only 2 working, continue their conversation. A group of people come in and the girl comes out to their table and jokes about how she's the manager (I sincerely hope not!). Then she asks them what they would like to drink. Apparently, serving your regulars/friends takes priority over guests that were there first. That was our cue to leave. Not spending time and money at an establishment with such rude service.

 Went there to celebrate a birthday. The food was amazing. I had the osso bucco and my friend had mussels. Had a side of the bacon cheddar biscuits. I could eat them every day.The reason I gave it a 4 is because of the server. She seemed to be annoyed when we asked questions about different items on the menu. Plus the manager stopped by our table and we told her both of us were having a birthday this week.and she said we would be getting a complimentary dessert. The server came by and asked if we wanted dessert and we told her the manager said it was on the house. She snapped at us and said I knpw that. We shared the coconut cake.Amazing! We had ordered coffee with our dessert and asked for a refill after I paid the bill which was over $70 including the 20 percent tip.That seemed to really irritate her. She brought us the coffee, but no more cream. My friend said do you think they charge per cup and she is upset we asked for a refill after the bill was paid or she's unhappy with her tip? The manager was at the door when we left and we told her how fabulous the food was. My regret is not telling her about the server. The food rates 5 stars and I will definitely be back, but make sure I have a different server. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My family and I were feeling something new today. However, trying this was a bad idea. The tables inside the building are less than a foot apart. I felt like I was eating with strangers, and it was uncomfortable. Also, it was extremely hot inside. It is hard to enjoy a meal when sweating. When I went up to get food, there was a woman at the buffet licking her fingers and then grabbing the tongs to get food. It was gross. We had to leave after not even finishing our first plate.

 Went here last week with two other couples for the Happy Hour. First, the facility is very attractive, with a rustic, old hacienda feeling. Because it was a nice afternoon we sat on the patio. We were fortunate to sit on the east side of the patio because it not only protected as from the afternoon sun but the north side looks over the muddy irrigation canal Scottsdale promotes as ""The Waterfront"" while the east side overlooks Stetson St. Happy Hour has a limited selection of $3 tapas. My wife and I shared the meatballs, chix w/ saffron rice, and the pork bruschetta. We found them okay, nothing special, and a bit skimpy in portion size, except for the rice. There were 3 small meatballs, which were good. The pork consisted of 2 small pieces of meat on wooden skewers. The chix w/saffron rice was the best of the three in terms of taste and quantity. Of the other four people with us, three felt as we did that the food was okay while the fourth thought the food was horrible. Happy Hour also has two-for-one sangria and house wines. Opt for the wine because the sangria, while flavorful is a very small serving. We would not make a special effort to return here for Happy Hour but if we were in the vicinity would probably stop. Be very careful of the waiter pushing their paella specials! Prices are $25 or $45 PER PERSON which is not emphasized by the waiter so you could get a big surprise. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I'm a huge fan of Kohls and moving to the Charlotte area has pushed me to find a different Kohls than the one I always went to an hour away. And here it goes, from the many other Kohls that I've stepped foot on, this is the most disorganized department store I've been to. The prices are higher than other Kohls' for the EXACT same product. I purchased a cardigan for $21 at the Charlotte Kohls while the day after I visited my hometown Kohls and found the exact cardigan for $15. That was a return. The selection in this Kohls is so poor. I asked an associate if she could help me find a pencil skirt in the middle of the summer and she said that they don't carry skirts. How can they not carry skirts?!?! Last week I stopped by to get the battery of my watch changed. I purchased this watch for $250 at their store and when I asked the lady to change my battery she told me that she is afraid to do it because she broke her watch changing the battery. Are you kidding me? You also have to pay for a battery change while other Kohls change it for free. I love Kohls but everytime I've been to this store I've gotten an attitude from most of the associates and never been able to find a good deal so I've stopped going. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Not Rustic one bit but sort of Basement Chic. Family owned featuring The Home Cook preparation Style of breakfast, lunch and dinners in a wide assortment of diner priced meals. I noticed while dining at lunch time that most people were having breakfast plates and the few who weren't where having GIANT sized burritos and almost everyone leaving were carrying out doggy boxes for latter . I decided on a Spicy Chicken Wrap and got to pick one of 12 sides I picked Grilled Vegetables. Well it wasn't too salty or oily and the chicken seemed fresh and being an overly generous portion that could feed two ladies I think I should give 3 stars but, My Spicy Chicken Wrap was NOT SPICY one bit and when I took a bite out of it a big slice of tomato plopped out and the 1/2 wrap I was holding started squirting out liquid all over the plate like it was peeing. My side of grilled vegetables were peppers onions mushrooms zucchini cut real small like omelet mix so they were disappointing , I was thinking I would get pieces of vegetables maybe carrots or broccoli.

 I had been waiting for this convenient place to open, but it took me a little while afterward to get around to eating here, & I wish I had read the reviews first. Anyhow, here's how it went for me here today at a little after 11 AM: Good: I found this new place to be clean & comfortable inside, with both booths & tables. This was my first visit to a Federico's, & you order at the counter, & then they call you to pick up. I ordered a #12 Two Chiles Rellenos plate. It comes with tortillas, & I asked for corn, & also a shredded beef hard taco to go along with it, since I was pretty hungry & wanted to be sure it was enough food. Not so good: Back at the table, I noticed that my ticket had the #17 Chile Verde plate on it, with corn tortillas, rather than Chiles Rellenos, with corn tortillas. I went back up to the counter & the girl said she would fix it. Not so good: It was a rather long time later, when my number was called, even though the restaurant wasn't busy. A person who worked nearby with a half-hour lunch break would never have been able to eat the food before they had to leave. Good: My plate came out piled high with food, & looked really attractive. The Chiles had a big dollop of guacamole & also sour cream on top, & there was a little salad plus generous servings of refried beans & Spanish Rice. Not so good: I started with bites of beans, rice, & a piece off the end of one of the chiles. My plate food was all just barely warm... almost room temperature! :-O Not so good: I unwrapped my tortilla package, & the tortilla was hot, but it was FLOUR! I ordered corn, & that was printed IN RED on their copy of my receipt! Not so good: They used Anaheim Chiles for the Rellenos, & by the time they're breaded & covered with sauce & the two toppings, you can barely taste the chiles. They were too mild for this recipe, & if they want to use long skinny chiles, they should have been Nu Mex Big Jims like the other restaurants around the Valley give you. (Otherwise, use a big Pablano, & only serve one.) The only thing that saved this place from one Star was that the flavor of the beans & rice was good, & the portions of everything generous. (I didn't need to have ordered the side taco.) They DO really feed you here, but they need to tighten up the ship... a lot! :-O #12 Chiles Rellenos Plate $6.59, Shredded Beef Hard Taco $2.09.

 For $50 a person, Bacchanal Buffet is one of the most expensive buffet in the strip. I had such high expectation for this since it is rated as the best buffet by numerous sources. Unfortunately, I don't think this place really lives up to the hype. We came here around 6pm on a weekday and there was zero wait. We walked up to the cashier, she swiped my credit card and we were seated right away. I love the glass decorations here and they made the place so much more prettier. As I walked through the area, I realize that this place is gigangtic. On one side, there is the buffet that goes on and on while the middle area is reserved specifically for desserts. To start off with the good, I love the desserts here. There are just so much varieties so much sure you save room in your stomach for them. From the usual cheesecakes, ice-creams to the more unique crepes and macaroons, they are absolutely delicious. As for my other favorites, they include the cocktail shrimps and lamb chops. The meat was so tender and juicy. As for the not so good, let's start with the service. It was by far the worst service I have received in any of the Vegas buffets I have eaten. Every time when I finished a plate and grabbed more food, the previous plate would always be there waiting for me. And with 2 people eating, that is a lot of plate stacking to save room for the not very large table to begin with. Drink refills were also very slow and ours didn't get refilled until we were already at the dessert phase (I had to even ask for it). If the servers can't even handle the people on a weekday, what would they do on a weekend? As for the food, I was pretty disappointed with the seafood. The oysters were very skinny, the crab legs were very salty and the clams were very sandy. The Japanese section also needs major improvement because the sushi selection is quite little. Seriously, I can find a $20 buffet in LA with better selection than what they offer here. If the price of the buffet is somewhat lower, I would rate buffet a lot higher. But for $50, I just don't think the selection and the quality of the food are worth that much. For now, Bellagio buffet is still my number one favorite in Vegas. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I don't know how this place has stayed in business for so long. It has never appealed to me, yet some family member drags me there every five years or so. It never changes. It seems like an independently owned Chili's. The menu is boring. The food nothing special. Most recently, I ordered a salad and asked for some rolls or bread and they didn't have anything except for some super spongy Italian sliced bread that tasted like a step up from wonder bread. My beet salad had such crunch beets they were barely cooked. Grapefruit segments were all membrane. Lettuce was ice cold, nearly frozen. See you in another five years. ",0,1,0,0,0

 He does get the job done and on time. He is courteous and friendly. I must say, though, that on two separate occasions he took some items of mine with him. The first time I hired him was to install some kitchen appliances, one of the appliances being a gas stove. I purchased a gas range connector kit not knowing that the stove already came with one. So, I ended up with two gas range connector kits. I kept both kits with the stove. He finished installing the kitchen appliances (a dishwasher, a gas stove, and an over the range microwave) in a timely manner. After he left I could not find the extra gas connector kit that I had left with the stove. I thought maybe he placed it somewhere on the counter or in the adjacent room where the appliances had been sitting. The extra kit was never found. We hired him again several months later to replace our old garbage disposal with a new one. Again, he showed up on time and was friendly and courteous. The new garbage disposal came with its own gasket, flange, and rings. He replaced the old one with the new one in a timely manner and then moved on to some other things in house that needed fixing. Upon him leaving, I looked at his bucket of tools he was carrying with him. In the bucket I saw a gasket, flange, and rings. After he left, I was checking out the new garbage disposal and realized that he reused the old flange (and most likely reused the old gasket and rings as well). The new garbage disposal came with a nice, shiny flange. It was obvious to me that he did not use the nice, shiny flange. The gasket, flange, and rings I saw in his bucket of tools were the ones that came with the new garbage disposal. It is one thing to reuse the old gasket, flange, and rings because they seem like they are in good condition. That I can understand. But, he took it to a whole different level of shadiness by basically stealing. Yes, I probably would have just placed that extra gas connector kit, gasket, rings, and the nice, shiny flange in a drawer, never to be used. But he could have at least asked to take them. I probably wouldn't have cared if he asked but he didn't. So that is why I would not hire him again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 2.5 Stars I share the sentiment with my fellow Yelpers on The Golden Spoon on its decline of quality. I first found The Golden Spoon in Carlsbad, CA about 8 years ago. They then infiltrated the valley with many many stores which made me happy with our favorite place for Froyo at that time. After having a pretty good presence in the valley stores started to close for good. My six mile trek became traveling across town to get this awesome Froyo. The Golden Spoon to me is like one of those family members you look past their flaws because you're so fawn of them. Well my eyes are now open to the fact that their frozen yogurt no longer has the same great taste I remembered and this store is always dirty.

 Went here a few times on lunch with co-workers, and I honestly can't even remember what I had, any of the times I was there; the most recent having been yesterday. It was something with chickpeas. While that probably says a lot right there, the food wasn't bad, it just wasn't anywhere near where I like my Mediterranean fare to be. There was nothing special or memorable to it, and it was sort of overall quite bland. Possibly because it's not Persian or Greek or Moroccan, but some sort of Americanized, averaged version of all the widely varied cuisines that get lumped into ""Mediterranean"". It's a sort of ""health-food-ified"" Frankenstein that has all the right parts of delicious Mediterranean food, but they just aren't working quiiiiite right. Food alone would give it 3 stars, though. I never feel oogy after eating it, and it is what it advertises. What knocks it down to two, is the fact that every time I come in, I'm treated very rudely. One of my co-workers with a stamp loyalty card who was buying another co-worker who forgot his wallet in his desk lunch tried to get two stamps, and was actually yelled at. On another occasion I was given the third degree for asking for napkins with my takeout. There's a rather snarly atmosphere of ""the customer is trying to pull the wool over our eyes and steal our plastic cutlery!"" that just does not impress. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The husband and I did the 9pm guided tour. Here's why I gave it only 3 stars: -The signs themselves weren't turned on, but instead were illuminated by ground lights facing the signs. We specifically chose the night tour because we wanted to see the neon signs in their full glory. Had we known the signs would only be visible via ground lights, we would have chosen a day tour. -Our tour guide was a bit soft spoken, so for the hearing impaired (like, my husband) this was an inconvenience. There's nothing available to read on each of the signs, so hearing the tour guide is crucial. Had those 2 matters not existed, I easily would have given this museum 5 stars! The tour was a lot of fun. It's neat to see the signs that coined early Las Vegas as ""Glitter Gulch."" The stories of how some of the hotels/motels/casinos started and evolved along with their signs is very enjoyable. Figures mentioned range from a prestigious dry cleaners and Liberace to ""Bugsy"" Siegel and, of course, Elvis. Although soft spoken, our tour guide was enthusiastic, informative, and knowledgeable of the signs and the establishments they came from. Parking is free, and that's always nice. ",0,0,1,0,0

 A neighborhood ethnic place in yet another ubiquitous strip mall. I thought the food was good and the owners charming. I had the lamb shank with vegetables and cous cous.

 Reid's is a local grocery store, with a little cafe attached. If I were to work in the area, I'd probably frequent this place quite often. The prices did seem a little pricier than your normal grocer, but you'd kind of expect that from this location. It's located on the bottom floor in 7th Street Station parking garage & borders the light rail. They have several sets of tables & chairs for eating lunch on a nice day. I did a quick walk through the store & this really is a full grocery store, having everything you'd need on a shopping trip. They may not have a huge variety or assortment of things, but they have every type of item you'd find in your local large grocer. Also, they have a large wine selection, 2 aisles worth. I'm no wine connoisseur, but they seemed to have a good selection from low end to high end. Reid's is really a nice little, local grocer that has all of your needs in the food department. They also serve up some lunch but I haven't had any so I can't speak to that. If I were to work uptown, I'd definitely check this out more often & pick up some goodies here. ",0,0,1,0,0

I don't mind when you can't check in early but when some jerk at the front desk makes it my problem it is beyond disappointing. And no tag line like ""hi welcome to planet Hollywood"". Instead we got a disgruntled young punk who needs an attitude adjustment. If you are reading this PH I suggest you start hiring engaged employees especially with unemployment still high. As prominent employers have always said, you need to hire stars to represent the company's image.

 3.5 stars. Don't get me wrong, the Vdarra is a great alternative option for accommodations on The Strip. I like how this hotel doesn't have a casino and is smoke free. My room was upgraded to an executive suite which included a washer/dryer, kitchen, king sized bed and a couch that converted into a mattress. It was perfect for my group of friends and I to rest comfortably. One thing that bugged me about the suite was that you can smell a hint of mildew (?) in the air. Luckily it wasn't too strong and was easy to cover up with an air freshener. The pool area was fine. I'm in the minority of those who doesn't like to tan my skin to death so it would have been nice if there were shaded areas to lounge around in. We also were not aware that the Vdarra charges a $22.40 front desk fee after our stay. One of my girls called to inquire why we were charged for that. The reason was that this covered the use of the pool and spa, water bottles and phone usage (which we all didn't take advantage of minus the pool). If I stay here again, I definitely will take advantage of all of the amenities the Vdarra has to offer. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We always do take out, so I can tell you that the food is consistently delicious. I do think that the staff are ""on island time"" because they take their time and do not rush. My favorite is the curry chicken with greens and black beans. My partner likes the ribs with slaw and black beans. Good food, large portions, reasonable prices... keeps me coming back for more!

 I am huge fan of Michael Mina restaurants! From San Francisco to Scottsdale I will go out of my way to experience his different concepts. Always a great experience..except AF. The food - fantastic! Great presentation..flavorful and unique in combination of ingredients. Why a one star rating? Service.. Service kills any positive thoughts I had about AF. With so many choices we have as diners, restaurants should put their best foot forward when it comes to service. I do not accept restaurants providing excellent food and mediocre service. We must have had the new server that they just hired away from Applebees.. and let me tell you after spending $300 for two of us I expect better. He would hardly talk, and when he did, it was mumbled. Hardly came around to see if we needed anything, was laughing and joking with his other table and barely said two words to us. Why the attitude I don't know. It was that way from the start. My recommendation is don't use your weakest talent to take care of your strongest customers. Just doesn't work. Even after sending a quick note about out disappointment to their people.. No one seemed to care. And at this point neither do I - off to new and different restaurants. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Burrito with chorizo had far too much chorizo. I requested light chorizo yet it was so overloaded I couldn't see or taste the egg.

 I'm only giving 3 stars for 2 reasons: mediocre service and a so-so presentation. The restaurant is located near UNLV, which probably explains why everything is only mediocre because it caters mostly to students. The food quality and the prices are great though. Palatability is questionable at first glance because of the presentation, as I mentioned earlier. They have good promos like 12 rolls for 5.99 usd... extremely cheap for good-tasting food.

 Been to this location 3+ times, always underwhelmed. I like the geographic location and its hours. Slices are big, crust OK+, and OK toppings. Here's what we hate: They always have two or three dry, withered pies that look like they should have been thrown into the trash hours ago, right up front (Who's going to buy that!?). ""Hey, look at all those gross ones"" is NOT the first thing I want to spring to mind as I saddle up to the plexiglass and pick out a slice. They make pineapple, pepperoni pizza? Who thinks that's a good idea? Particularly when they list capicola as an available topping, which is a kind of HAM. Also, the dudes making pies (at least at this location) look like they work at gun point; they never smile or make eye contact--they don't look like they're even beginning to enjoy what they're doing. A ""great attitude"" is not something I would normally expect from dudes at a pizza joint, but these dudes work in an OPEN kitchen. And open kitchens DO seem to necessitate some social interaction with the customer. If, for example, the counter-dude is in the back, and a sudden swarm of customers buzz in, I've twice seen pizza-dude ignore the customers in favor of waiting on counter-dude to notice and return. That's horrible customer service. At any rate, this is an OK spot to get an OK slice, or even to get a pie to go if you're drunk or starving, or if you're in a bind (you just moved). But I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at Pizza Sola, at least not at this location. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was seeking a new Dentist because my current one stopped offering nitrus. I haven't had any dentist/hygenist work on my mouth without nitrus for over 30 years! When I arrived at Pinnacle Peak Dentistry, I was warmly welcomed and thanked for selecting their practice. I was introduced to my hygenist, Jackie and I immediately felt comfortable. She said she could use nitrus but explained that, for years, she used a topical ointment that would eliminate any discomfort and assured me she was thorough but gentle. I am not saying I wasn't nervous but I felt absolutely no pain or discomfort. When Dr. Clayton came in, he have my mouth a thorough examination and explained areas where I should be more diligent - again, he was warm and welcoming. I can't say enough about Dr. Clayton and his team. While I never look forward to visiting the Dentist, I won't be as hesitant when I return for my next visit in April. ",0,0,0,0,1

 LOOK OVER HERE FOLKS ! Its very simple! Tsing tao slings chinese food at crazy affordable prices. DO NOT GO THERE TO EAT IN......TRUST ME. Call for a delivery or pick up. Pro's- 7.00 dinner combo's include a small eggroll and rice..killer deal They have duck sauce, plastic cutlery, soy sauce, sticks right next to the counter. Food was good Dinner combo comes in a plastic snap lid container.....no need to transfer leftovers. They deliver.....why i dont know? Their prices are great!! CONS....the place is small, faces west and was baking hot when we were there. All of the tables turn into a waiting area for pick up customers There really is little space to eat there. We grabbed ours to go Their fried rice is orange.....bright orange......its ok. ....but real fried rice is dark brown. Just saying.... In the end.....where the heck are you going to get 2 combo orders WITH EGGROLLS for 14.50 ? Eggrolls and fried rice are huge upcharges at most places. Last fried rice we ordered was 7.00 !!

 I love a good steak and have no problem paying for one, but Prime's is not worth the price. We had two different cuts, the porterhouse and the dry-aged bone-in ribeye. The quality of the steak might have been there, but the preparation of it threw the whole thing off. However, I did really like the sauce that accompanied the steaks, so much so that we requested some in leftover box. We had truffle mashed potatoes that were divine (but honestly, it's truffle so how bad could it be?) but the glazed carrots were tangy, which I did not like at all. As for the appetizers, we shared the Caesar salad which was fabulous. The presentation was unique in that it was a whole head of romaine lettuce (I'll post a picture). Service was confusing to say the least. Our server was very nice and friendly, but very condescending. Maybe it was because we look young, but when we asked a question about the mushrooms he became very patronizing towards us. The same when we wanted coffee. It was very odd. We also waited a long time for little things like the coffee, bread, butter, etc. They didn't even bring bread until we asked for it. I much prefer returning to Craftsteak on the Strip. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Canal has been a stop on many a ""bar tour"" through the Waterfront / Old Town area. The bar always has a good crowd in the evenings and the patio is fantastic on warm nights. With summer finally clearing out and it now being possible to sit outside during the daylight hours, we made our way to Canal for some late lunch / day drinking on a recent Sunday. First off, what a great place to sit and people watch! This was the first time we had ever ordered food at Canal, so we were interested to see if the cuisine lived up to the hip decor and vibe of the restaurant. The baby burgers (3 of them) were served up on an ""English High Tea"" tray. Great presentation, and the actual taste of those little guys didn't disappoint.....ahi tuna / fillet mignon / ground chicken. The fillet was my favorite. What can I say? I like red meat! We also had the fish tacos.....delicious! A great experience, all around. We're definitely looking forward to getting back here for dinner soon. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Looks like a real old-school comedy club, very small, seating at tables, and a low stage with red velvet curtain. I didn't go when Brad Garrett was there, so we had a bunch of no name comedians who came up and preformed. Everyone who came up were really amateurs who jumped from joke to joke with no real momentum. They really overused curse words, which really watered down most of the jokes. Using the F-word really loud doesn't make for good comedy. I got two free tickets off MyVegas, so my 2 friends and I all split a third ticket for only $55. Went there on 2/13/13. My friends and I came a little late, so the host gave us a booth in the back, which was still pretty close as the place is pretty small. I just wanted a glass of water, but had to pay $6 for Fiji Water instead. I wouldn't really recommend going back to this comedy club unless your really drunk or just looking for a cheap show. It seemed like it was kind of a hit or miss place for comedians, but all of the people there my night were misses. If your going to go, get the two free tickets of MyVegas, drink a lot before you go, and don't have very high expectations. Can't really spend a whole night there, but it's something to do.

 I have been going to Shaina for ALL of my waxing needs for years now and I seriously can't say enough good things about her and my experiences at Pink Cherry: Brazilian & Brows Specialty Waxing. The new location is AMAZING down to every detail. Gorgeous!! It is super clean, beautifully designed throughout to that of a high-end boutique, super friendly and professional staff, awesome products (that I love to buy!), and I couldn't imagine going anywhere else to get waxed! Honestly, it doesn't matter where you are coming from, this place is worth the trip as I know I wouldn't think for a second to go anywhere else!!! I have gotten waxed for years (eyebrows specifically), but it's always left me frustrated with the shaping of my brows and the experiences have always been mixed in terms of satisfaction. When I started coming here, Shaina was super friendly, quick, and professional! She actually ASKED me what I was needing in terms of the shaping and not only did she help my shape grow back beautifully, I literally know I can go in to my appointment and just TRUST her completely that I will leave with amazing brows! She is very detail oriented (as it shows in every aspect of her business) and while I may have found her purely by LUCK in the past, it is one find I have never regretted!! I have recommended this place to all of my family and friends and literally have family members who FLY into Vegas and go to Pink Chery: Brazilian & Brows to get waxed by Shaina! I have had Brazilians and Bikini waxes here as well and they have been as painless as possible and not to mention quick. Shaina is great at talking to you through the whole thing where it makes you nearly forget what your appointment is for and by the time you do, it's over! ;) I honestly can't say enough good things about this place and why I would recommend going here for all of your waxing needs!! Try this place once and you will be hooked!!! By the way, I absolutely LOVE the ""Whoopie Hand Cream""..it smells soooo delicious and leaves your skin feeling SUPER soft!!!! I've only seen it at THIS store but I recommend it to all my friends to give it a try and it would make a fantastic gift! And what I love even more is how AFFORDABLE all of the products are!!

 While in Vegas, the boyfriend and I went to this buffet on one of our mornings while in town. This buffet is pricey at about $35 a person, but it is worth it! They also have unlimited mimosas for about $10. Wait is usually about 30 minutes to get a table. Food wise, they have everything from omelettes, to french toast, to fruit, to seafood, to pancakes and much more. Food was really good and I got full petty fast. Service was pretty good and they kept our drinks full and they always took our plates away right away. I would probably be back here in the future when we are back in Vegas! Cheers. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I don't even know where to start. Maybe with the stained tablecloth? Or maybe with the decorations held up by masking tape? Oh, I know! How about the fact that we had to wait half an hour for our entrees! This place looks gross, inside and out, and the food I had was really superlatively awful. I love Indian food because it is so flavorful, and this completely failed to live up to expectations. I had the Samosas, which weren't TOO awful, and the Palak Paneer, which literally had almost no flavor at all. To add insult to injury everything was cold, we didn't get any rice (I guess you're supposed to buy it separately? Would have been nice to know...) and service took FOREVER which is totally understandable since there was ONE other table in the entire place. The only reason we went to this place was because we mistakenly bought a groupon that we thought was for the other Saffron that is closer to us, but if I had known what it was going to be like I would have just kissed the money for the groupon goodbye and NOT BOTHERED.

 In a town with a lot of expensive restaurants, this place stands out. I went with the girlfriend and had the tasting menu, which at $148 a piece as not cheap. The Chimay blanche was only $7, which is a bargain anywhere. The seating was at a bar, and was relatively casual, which is a nice change for a fine dining place. The tasting was ten courses, all of which were excellent, a few of which were really. The amuse of a foie-gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam was fantastic, as was the langoustine carpaccio with poppy seeds and the butter-poached oysters. The main course was a foie-gras stuffed quail with truffled mashed potatoes. Robuchon is famous for his ""pommes puree"", which I've tried to replicate at home from the recipe in ""The Complete Robuchon"". It doesn't come close, sadly. The desserts were also great, especially the pina colada dessert, which was pineapple, yogurt ice cream, malibu rum gelee, and pop rocks hidden in there.

 I grew up here and have been coming to Papa Dels since 1976. It sure has gotten mediocre. Went here today for lunch and first off the restaurant needs an update (this building dates from the 1990s if memory serves when the original location on 6th St. closed). It's ratty looking with a huge stain on the ceiling where the wallpaper has peeled off. Fix it. How hard can that be? The dough for the pizza (we ordered slices) has always been on the bready side, but I used to like that since it was moist and flavorful. This was dry as dust, lacking in sauce and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp forever. Blech. And seriously. It's not 1976 anymore. A salad can contain something other than iceberg lettuce. It's even available here in the midwest now, if the local grocery stores are any indication. Use it. My nephew ordered breadsticks that were just gross. Huge batons of bread (the pizza dough?) with a nuclear cheese or marinara sauce. They were completely unflavored. No cheese, garlic, butter or anything. Just batons of dry bread. Again, gross. Sad that an old institution has gone so far downhill. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I just went through the drive through and ordered a hot ham and cheese and a side salad. I asked for ranch dressing. The drive through wait was longer than I had expected but not the worst. I get to the window and I pay for my order and I hear the lady at the window specifically ask the person who handed her the bag if there was ranch dressing in it and a fork and the person told her yes. She said she was just checking to be sure they were there. I get back to the office and yes there is a plastic fork but no, there is NOT any dressing. Clearly the person lied about putting it in the bag. Sadly, that makes my review even worse because now I am eating a salad with no dressing and quite frankly I don't think it's very good this way!! Aside from not having any dressing the salad itself is warm. I prefer a crisp cold salad like most people. However, the ring of onion on it is very hot. Whew!!

The potatoes were soft and mushy, and even the toast seemed a bit off. To top it off, as soon as we got our meal, we were given our check.

 I really do love the food here but the rest of the experience just makes me never want to go back. I've been several times where I've had to wait much much too long for my food. Even at lunch in the middle of the week when the restaurant was only half full. But last night took the cake. We came in and since there were no free tables, we sat at the bar. We ordered some sodas and then our food pretty quickly. I had to be at work an hour and a half later so we definitely thought there'd be plenty of time but after 45 minutes without getting our food, I was getting very anxious. I finally asked a waitress to check on our food and I told her I had to leave soon to go to work. She kind of dilly-dallied into the kitchen and came back out and told us that our waitress would let us know what was going on. Our waitress came back out, did some stuff on the computer, cleaned some plates, and all while I was just staring at her waiting for an answer. Finally she comes to me and says that the kitchen lost a few tickets or I guess they thought our food had already come out or some lame answer. I told her to forget it because I just couldn't wait any longer. She said ""well don't worry about the drinks."" Thanks...if I had known I was going to get free drinks instead of dinner, I would've ordered a bottle of wine. I would've really appreciated a gift certificate or something. Now, I have worked in many restaurants and I understand things happen. But she really should've noticed after 20 minutes that we have not had our food and checked on it herself. The fact that I had to ask and then there was no sense of urgency or sincere remorse really irked me. I ended up going down to Fuel for a quick slice of pizza and inhaled it before work. Not what I had looked forward to doing right before 6 hours on my feet serving people drinks. I think I'll just be officially done with this place. Unfortunately. ",0,1,0,0,0

 this restuarant is a well-kept secret. the food is great -- try the vegetable medley -- and the staff is excellent. it's almost always deserted during dinner, so it's like having an entire restaurant to yourself. the best part. if you have an entertainment book, your meals are always 2-for-1 (expect on holidays). they never punch your diner's card, so you can use it as many times as you want. i'm talking about a prime rib dinner for two people for less than $20.

 Wow, as a Starbucks person generally, I was pretty impressed with this Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. The Cashier was friendly and talkative, which made me feel quite welcome even thought I'm not a regular. The baristas were quick and the pumpkin latte gave Starbucks a real run for its money. Most importantly, everything was clean-- from the ""condiment"" bar to the wands of the espresso machine (a bit of a ""must"" for me). I'm going back! Starbucks might have to up it's game to get me back! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Cory was my Energy Auditor and Jeff was my service rep, and both were extremely friendly, knowledgable, and time efficient. There was no sales pressure, and I was comfortable scheduling some work to be done through them. Unfortunately, through unforeseen financial circumstances, I had to cancel the work. And, I have to give them credit for not pushing me to reschedule, not being upset, and being very customer satisfaction oriented. This seems to be a very professional company, and I will go back to them once I am ready to resume any work to be done. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We had a bite to eat after seeing Le Reve. I was sort of worried based on the mixed reviews. They have a great wine list and I thought they were priced well. We ordered a bottle of wine and started with three vegetables for an appetizer - olives, asparagus with pecorino, and roasted beets. These were definitely hits and i would highly recommend any of them. We had the pancetta pizza with goat cheese. The pizza crust was very crisp and good - I wouldn't call it great. I work for an Italian company and haved travelled to Italy quite a bit and just don't think the pizza was all that ""authentic"". I would return here for some wine and appetizers but probably would skip the pizza. One final comment. This place is ok, it's not great, but I find the vehemence and prsonal attacks directed towards Mario Batali a bit disturbing. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Finally I got to try this place!!! Yay!!! Thanks to Amy K's suggestion, we ordered the drunken noodle soft crab and the northern red curry. We also ordered this beef dish...can't remember the name...and we also ordered catfish. And last but certainly not least, the mango sticky rice: drunken noodle soft crab: Very good. Definitely a must try. northern red curry: Yes, not much of a curry, more like a stew. Also not as sweet as panang..I think they use less coconut milk. So if you like coconut milk, you may not like this version of curry as much. beef dish: it was a cold dish...cubed filet mignon..anyway, we thought it would be warm so it was a little surprising..it tasted like the beef on the beef salad...good but nothing extraordinary. catfish: breaded and sauced...pretty good...loved it! put the sauce on our rice and ate it up! You must try it!! mango sticky rice: I looooooved this version...the rice was more complex in flavors than the others I've tasted...maybe I'm crazy...even the mango pieces were perfectly ripe and was sweeter than normal, too...but it was really good...my friend who doesn't even like sweets, loved it, too...i could come back just for this...hopefully i'm not building it up too much...haha Wish they were local...

 I've been here on 2 occasions. Once for dinner, and once for lunch. Both times have been good, quality experiences. When we had dinner at Tagliani's it was 4 of us. I was with my family, and my brother in law raved about it. We ordered 2 appetizers, and each of us ordered an entree. We family styled the entrees and everyone ate some of everything. All of it was very good. Bread was fresh and warm. Put it in the the ""Must do again"" category. Went back for lunch a few days ago. Went to check-in, and low and behold, a free app! Wings and Rings! And honestly, they were the best wings I've ever had. Grilled to absolute perfection. The rings were homemade. Awesome. I had the lunch special baked ziti. Very good. Gf had the Eggpant Parmesian. She gave it a 3.5. I tried the spaghetti and maranara that went with it. I thought it had a very clean, and fresh flavor. Great for a maranara. Little one had the pepperoni pizza off of the Kids' Menu. I had a couple of bites to try it, and I thought it was excellent. I'd have eaten it. The only gripe was the bread seemed a tad dated. But, it was 3pm when we got there, and I'm sure fresh bread might be a stretch. Overall, it was an excellent experience with great food, and good service. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The owner came to bus the table beside ours and sat to have a conversation. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. So I don't want this 3/5 to be misconstrued- by all means go to this Latin flare restaurant and try each of their, approximately, one million tequilas. But prepare to pay for the experience. I could stand a bit more quality for the price. The atmosphere is super relaxed and funky and the food was pretty good. My only complaints are their lack of queso dip for the chips and the price. But if these aren't a turnoff for you, please try it out. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This review is strictly on the Botox injections I received at Voci Spa. I know nothing else about their services like massages and facials so those may be great. My Botox experience has not been pleasant at all. I got in at the last minute with their most ""seasoned"" Botox injector. She spent plenty of time w me discussing her credentials and how she does things. I was very clear in my expectations about wanting my crows-feet taken care of. She suggested we do something like 10 units on each side including below the eyelid, right on top of my cheek where I have some fine lines as well. I told her I was hesitant bc I had heard it shouldn't be placed there due to lower eyelid swelling which can cause bags and even weaken your cheek a bit which could cause a slight sagging. I've been told this by other injectors. She assured me that would not be the case and encouraged me to do it. She said they charge by the unit which is what I was told when I initially called. This is not exactly precise. They charge by the Botox syringe or vial. Basically she said I would need 8-10 on each side so I had to purchase two syringes/vials meaning I'd have left over product. She said she'd ""find somewhere else to place the extra"" so I wouldn't waste it but I declined. I told her I wanted to go conservative this first time and maybe later I could come back for more vs using it just to use it. It was a turn off bc I was actually paying per area and not really per unit as I had been told. Anyway, she injected around my eyes including underneath. I bruised badly underneath my right eye (which has never happened before) and both lower lids immediately swelled which produced bags & extra lines. My concerns had been valid and I should've listened to my gut. I respect her many years in the business but that does not mean she is a good injector. A good injector takes into account the potential compensatory muscle movement and or swelling too in this case that can just give you a new problem whilst getting rid of another. The bruise goes away quickly but the bags don't and trust me Botox can cause bags underneath the eyes for sure- especially when too much product is used. Don't let anybody tell you differently. The bags may improve as the Botox where's off but while the fluid is there it's just stretching out that delicate skin and I can do nothing about it. The risk of placing it under the eye is just not warranted. Now I just wait for months to see if the bags improve. So frustrating. Listen to your gut people! ",1,0,0,0,0

 We stopped into Su Vino using a Groupon which was a super deal- tasting flight of 5 wines for two people + 1 appetizer at 15$. The appetizer alone cost about this much. The location is really nice, set back off the main area a bit- they have outdoor seating as well as indoor and bar seats. We sat at the bar and got great service. The two men on staff were very friendly and we had a good chat with them while doing our tasting. The wines tend to be on the sweeter side and they have some selections that are not what I'd choose to purchase myself, but it's fun to try them on the flight. Their Un-Oaked Chardonnay ($6 glass/$16 bottle) is crisp and clean, which I liked. We also tried the Razle Dazzle (sparkling wine $5 glass/$18 bottle) since we heard good things about it. I wouldn't order it at any point during a meal, but I would happily grab a bottle or two to drink with friends poolside- this stuff is sweet (but not sickly) and goes down easily. They have two 'Summer Refreshment Selections' which are very sweet and fruity (as you can perhaps tell by their names; Summer Rain and Blue Breeze). We tried the Summer Rain ($5glass/$11.75 bottle)- nothing wrong with a Riesling..has apple flavors which is nice. By far the best wines were the reds though. Their new release, Super Tuscan ($8.5 glass/$28.99 bottle) is very good, in my opinion. From what I remember it's a blend of Cab and ...ok I don't remember. It's nice though. The Bella Rossa ($8 glass/$24.5 bottle) was my husband's favorite. It has notes of chocolate and cherries. I'm not a big fan of Port, but their Porto Cocoa ($8 glass/$24.99 bottle) was pretty interesting and well worth a try. Usually these things are sickly syrupy sweet, yet this somehow managed to not hit that mark, which is good. It was our anniversary, so they gave us truffles (thank you!) to pair with our Port. Great way to finish the tasting. A note on the food- it is yum, but they do have everything prepackaged ready to go- they are not actually going to be cooking anything, more like assembling it on a plate. For me, this was fine for the Antipasto platter (which was the perfect size for two people). As added bonuses- they have a massive games table- you could buy a bottle and hang out for the afternoon which might be fun. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I wasn't expecting much from this restaurant, other than ok quality food with a high price for what it is. Surprisingly, the two noodle dishes we ordered were actually very good. I had Szechuan-style Beef noodle soup, which can be had for around seven dollars in California, but was around 13 dollars here. The noodles were a little weird, but the beef and soup were so delicious. The beef was actually very good quality with quite a bit of fat (which is apparently the correct style for this noodle soup). I gobbled it up. My dining mate had BBQ pork and duck noodle soup, which I wasn't particularly a fan of, but she said it was good (particularly the quality of the meats). The food itself was potentially of five-star quality for one of those quick sit and go restaurants in Vegas, but considering that it's about double the price and not THAT higher quality, I can only give it four stars.

 My family and i (a group of 5) came here for the poutine. enroute to the international fireworks competition at la ronde... while there is a lot of choices on the menu--burgers, tofu, salads... only 2 of poutine. i digress...each time we visit montreal we try to sample poutine from as many palces as possible (avoiding the fast food joints and sticking to the mom and pop places). so this go round we chose patati and we were happy with the poutine, but it was a small portion of very simple style poutine. while i'm not sure one needs a huge portion of poutine...it was only 4$ (canadian) but it hit the spot. our favourite poutine joint is still madam baldouc--they have the best selection and 2 sizes (large and larger). it was worth the trip to patati patata and exploring the avangart neighborhood...a bit of rock and roll meets hipster canadian style. good blonde ale as well. and good service from friendly guys behind the counter.

 I really like the food here, but consistently the service is atrocious. The servers are rude from the get go as if you are bothering them by just being there. Several examples: the restaurant only had two other couples seated, so when a friend popped in and we asked if we could get a 5th chair for the table, we were told a manager would have to approve it (this took several minutes as the manager was out smoking). My boyfriend and I both ordered bloody Mary's at brunch, but I was brought a tequila sunrise. As someone with lots of experience in the service industry, I immediately and very politely asked to have the drink I ordered. She took the sunrise away, did not return with a bloody, didn't apologize, and charged us for 2 bloodys and the sunrise. I sat at the bar once waiting for a table and the bartender told me he does not transfer checks to the waitresses because he doesn't get the tips then. The food is amazing, but don't expect the service to be prompt or polite. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Took the bf here for a very special milestone birthday. It was his first visit and my second, but has been several years for me. Had a drink at the bar while we waited a few minutes for a table. No, make that had a perfect, delicious, wish-I-could-replicate-that-at-home martini! We were seated by a gracious hostess, unfortunately it was a teeny tiny booth and the bf is super-tall so he was a little squished. Our server was all around wonderful, the Oysters Rockefeller amazing, and our steaks cooked to perfection. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the sommelier. Our server sent him over to assist us, and his disheveled appearance kind of turned me off right away. However, it was his total lack of enthusiasm that really got to me. He didn't seem interested in helping us at all, he barely spoke two sentences to us. Our server seemed more knowledgeable and was much more helpful, thank goodness! Overall, a wonderful dinner and will return for future special occasions. ",0,0,0,1,0

 For three weeks i have been waiting for this amazing buffet experience but have been let down with just pure disappointment. Before i went on my vegas vacation all my co workers have urged me to go to Le village buffet at Paris but i figured why not just go to the buffet that is closer, considering the fact that i was staying at the Mirage and didnt want to go through the hassle of leaving the hotel and driving through the traffic just for a buffet. Little did i know that this Cravings buffet was just awful. It was about 30 dollars per person, im not going to bitch about the price because everything in vegas is going to be expensive. I understand that majority of the buffets are about this price, so whatever right? I am a big seafood fan so i immediately went to the sushi bar and grabbed a tuna sushi with an avocado roll and a tuna roll. When i went back to my seat i noticed that the rice on the roll was stale and hard. I didnt even eat it. The tuna sushi was AWFUL it was a tiny little piece that was turning brown!!! i left it on the side of my plate because i didnt even want to touch it. I did enjoy the shrimp..so i grubbed on shrimp until i was sick of shrimp.. I figured that they couldnt mess up on salad and their salad bar was pretty good. but overall this was not a memorable experience. well..memorable yes..but in a bad way. ",0,1,0,0,0

 After trying Cafe Rio a few times. I now prefer this place over Chipotle! (They are very similar) What makes Cafe Rio stand out amongst it's competition is their sweet Barbacoa (shredded pork) it's just packed with flavor and just plain addicting! It's great in the salad or burrito. Try out the enchilda style (sauce and cheese baked on top of the burrito) when you get a burrito for a dollar more. I've tried the steak tacos as well. Not too bad but nothing to write home about. The prices are affordable and food portions are large. All the ingredients are always fresh and prepared right in front of you. Try out the house dressing on anything you order. As for drinks, they have a ton of selection, but since this is a Mexican restaurant, I suggest the Horchata!

 I'm sure I'm spoiled living by three awesome children's museums in the Chicagoland area, but this place was just okay. There were not that many things to do.

 Surprisingly very mediocre, considering I had heard such fantastic things. There are many things that could be talked about, but at a steakhouse like this everything should be coming back to the hunk of dry-aged beef in front of your face. It should be flavorful, seared to just a tad crisp on the outside, and it should be consistent. My steak was almost reasonable. My buddy's steak next to me (same cut) was left half-finished on the plate (overcooked and just generally not awesome). The ambience and service was great, but if you can't get the steak right...

 I can't believe I waited this long to come here, and regret not having been in sooner.

Clean, well decorated, with great staff. HUMONGOUS beer, wine and alcohol selection! OMG! They seem to really have it all here for just about anyone! Austin ordered a huge beer, and we split a pizza with french onion soup. The food was tasty, and we both walked away satisfied. What also impressed me was the staff. We were always getting checked on by someone, weather it was a server, the manager, or the bus boy taking our plates. Yard house also has a lot of TV's for your viewing pleasure. Ample space to sit and watch, weather its at the bar, table or booth. Open space, with lots of elbow room. No one's sitting on top of each other. Love it!

 Went to this place because of groupon, and sadly will not be back. It was a Friday around 730, any restaurants busiest time I understand, but when you put out a groupon you should expect it to be busier than normal on the first weekend. having 2 servers for the sushi side was a joke. it took about 20 minutes to get EDAMAME. told twice it was just so busy sorry. then another 30 minutes to get a few simple rolls like a spicy shrimp and california hand roll. Told again, it was just soo busy. They brought about the Bull roll and the setup calls for vodka to cause a flame to cook it partially. after 4 minutes of her trying to light it up, complaining about how bad the vodka they have is, it went on. Was lucky to have our water cups filled. The table next to us had not gotton 2 of their rolls and it was brought to ""another table"" one of the chefs came by to also apologize about it being very busy and waiting so long for everything, but what made me giggle was that he said, ""We are busy because we are good"" ....no, its because you just put out a groupon a few days ago.

 Vegas ain't cheap. It can be really difficult to have a solid meal for under $50 a person. I looked at the menu for Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria & Cucina and couldn't pass up the possibility of a good meal at very reasonable price. Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria is hidden within Crystals at City Center so we really wouldn't have found it if we didn't research restaurants in preparation for our trip. When planning our list of dining options, I discovered a fabulous secret: all day happy hour. Wolfgang Puck's Pizzeria offers all day happy hour at the bar which includes amazing deals on small plates and drinks. As there were only two of us, we walked right in and sat at the bar. We proceeded to order an insane amount of food including calamari, an insalata mista, gnocchi, and the lamb chorizo pizza. The calamari was crispy and delicious, one of the best I have had. It was served with a garlic aioli which made a fabulous dip. We received our salad shortly after finishing our calamari and were pleased but not wowed. It was a pretty basic salad with cherry tomatoes and parmesan but it was very well dressed. After finishing the salad we were happy to see a huge plate of gnocchi and a very large pizza, perfect for sharing. The gnocchi was one of the best I have had, served with a flavorful sausage bolognese, and the portion size was HUGE! The pizza was certainly upstaged by the gnocchi but still very good. The chorizo was tasty and I really loved the crust. We received our bill and were thrilled to see that it came to somewhere around $75-$80, a steal in Vegas! The food was excellent and I would definitely recommend it to someone wanting a delicious, casual meal in Vegas. Why four stars? Our waiter who was actually a bartender, was pretentious an inattentive. We did not receive any of the delicious bread people rave about and we barely saw him the entire time we were there! He was chatting and laughing with another party seated on the other side of the bar. That night I was very thankful for food runners because if there were none, we would've never eaten. This didn't seem to be an issue with every waiter/bartender, just ours so don't let this stop you from going. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've been here for three visits, two dinners and one lunch. I've been waiting to write a review, because I wanted to be fair. The service has always been pretty good here. I eat in the dining room, not the bar, and I'm greeted and seated promptly. The menu covers the basics for good BBQ; ribs, pulled pork, hot links, brisket, bbq chicken. Sides are good, and portions are generous. The ribs are awful. I mean, just wretched. Two stars bad, for a joint that could be doing better. The ribs were smoked, and clearly had some dry rub on them at some point. I like my ribs Memphis style, smoke and dry rub no sauce, so this should be right up my alley, right? That's where things go awry. The ribs are clearly reheated, which is perfectly normal. What's not normal is the texture. These ribs are squishy. There is no discernible difference in texture between the lean and the fat. These ribs are reheated by some moist heat process, which both rinses all the dry rub off and removes any of the char/caramelization from the grill. I saw grill marks on the ribs, so I'm not debating that the grill came into play at some point, but it was used way too little. I am begging that they change the method used to reheat the ribs. Ribs are the yardstick by which I measure good BBQ, and these aren't it. So much good stuff, but just terrible ribs. ",0,1,0,0,0

Never to go again, besides the other stores I normally go to, are way more organized, and friendlier than this one! ",1,0,0,0,0

 So I have to eat healthy says my doctor & my high blood pressure. So I was told thru the great vine that BFG cooks up good chicken. God I hate rumors and this is a perfect example as to why I cant stand a bunch of she said he said they said we said. Looks can be deceiving this is a very true statement. Anyway once in side the BFG it was packed so I felt good that this was a good decision to come here. I'm thinking its so packed in here this is going to be so good. Boy was I wrong. So we order food yes the husband was with me. Chicken mac & cheese ( Please see my pictures) along with other items. I have to tell you guys this was nothing but a mind game. I am still asking myself how can the line be outside if the food does not taste like anything. Its flavor less. It taste like it came from a common school cafeteria ewww! It took me back to elementary, middle school & high school. I looked at my husband and said I should have packed my own lunch. lol On my way out I saw a sticker from YELP by the front door I wondered if I was being punked and I also wondered if Ashton Kutcher would jump out from behind a car with a camera crew. Some one fooled YELP this food gets a big fat zero I wish I could take the one star back. They get a negative zero. I'm still at a lost for words on how they got the yelp sticker on the door.

 Christmas in Vegas? This should get you in the spirit! 20 or so themed light displays and you get to drive through the Las Vegas Speedway? Quite a unique experience. I read all the descriptions and news articles before coming and got real excited. Is it must see? I wouldn't go that far. Some of you will like this more than I did. Maybe I have high standards and have been fazed by all the people who go crazy on their houses during Christmas time... installing waving figures, ski lifts, shimmering lights, moving train sets, live music, and maybe even a visit from a real life Santa. It's not that elaborate here. You get all sorts of scenes, some Christmas related, some not so much. Elvis? Check. 12 Days of Christmas? Check. 3 wise men? Check. A lit McDonald's sign? Check. A castle sponsored by Yelp? Check. All of these are lit, but there aren't any moving parts or special effects. The most you get for effects is shimmering light tunnels that you drive through (pretty cool). None of the scenes overwhelmed me. It was $20 a car on the weekends ($15 Monday-Thursday), but I got a $2 discount for donating a bag of goods to the Goodwill collection truck located at the entrance. After you pay, there's a drive through station where you can buy little car snacks like popcorn, candy, and hot chocolate. They also have a dedicate station on onsite that you can turn your radio to to hear themed music while you're driving through. It takes about 30-45 minutes to drive through the whole thing, unless you have a really slow cars in front of you. Like racing on the Speedway, you can pass the slowbies on the turn if you rev up to 15 miles per hour. My advice? Take your time, because it doesn't last as long as the map makes it seem. In the end... worth doing if you have free time and are looking for something holiday themed to take your kids or sweetie too. Or you could just walk the flower garden at Bellagio and save yourself $20 and a 20 minute drive out of the city. ",0,0,1,0,0

 So I've been taking my clothes to this Delia's for about three years now and have been fairly impressed with their service (obviously, I've been going there for three years). However, something happened recently that may change my mind. I brought my dry cleaning in on Friday, April 12, 2013 and it's always ready the next day after 5:00, which is definitely a plus. So I picked up my clothes on Monday evening after work only to find out they had laundered, not dry cleaned, all of my expensive work shirts. I always leave explicit instructions to NOT launder my shirts as they have strechy material in them and will shrink and fade. Typically they reassure me that they wouldn't ever do that; however, this time they did. I was devastated when I picked them up. I was very poilte. The gentleman apologized and informed me they have several new people working there which may have been why this happened. I left the store with my dry cleaning hoping and praying my shirts were okay. Come to find out the next morning when I put one of them on, they had shrunk. They no longer fit my arms and I look like I'm trying to fit into a child's shirt. I called that day (which wasTuesday), spoke to someone and informed them of what had happened. I was told I would receive a call back in 20 minutes. I did not hear from anyone that day, so I called back the next morning. Again I was told that someone will call me back. It is now Thursday, I have a closet full of shrunken dress shirts and I still have not heard back from anyone. I'm writing this review in hopes of someone at Delia's realizing that you can't just ignore unhappy customers. I will happily return as a customer if they rectify this situation. However, if they do not, I will most definitely bring my business elsewhere since this lack of customer service is unacceptable. I will post again and let whoever is reading this know what happened. Until further notice, I highly recommend to anyone to not bring your clothes here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Visited this location a few weeks ago only to receive a completely wrong order. And, whatever it was that I received was not even edible - I took one bite and threw away. And, as you know Chick-fil-A is not cheap, so I spent $7 on nothing! I immediately sent an email and still haven't heard anything from them. Way to go on the customer service! Even McDonalds responds!! NEVER GOING TO ANOTHER CHICK-FIL-A! ",1,0,0,0,0

 My friends and I stayed two nights at the hotel. The part I liked the best was the huge bathroom with a shower and huge jacuzzi tub. I decided to see how the tub was with the jets, and two of the jets shot water up and across onto the wall. We were also missing a knob. If you like to work out the gym is pretty awesome, except it's warm. There is one bar to do curls with, free weights, elliptical, treadmill, some machine weights, and cold wet towels as well as green apples. There wasn't anything spectacular about the hotel. I wish there were more outlets around the bed, or plugs within the lamps. Our ipod dock also had a mashed up button. It has a kitchenette, fridge, microwave, LG tv. The TV guide didn't match up with the stations. I selected E and ended up with Bloomberg. I was in Arizona right before and stayed at a hotel at a fraction of the price and had more tv stations, free wifi, free breakfast, and parking, and a tv that matched up with the stations. I don't like resort fees. Your resort fee of $15 includes water bottles, newspaper, a clean room, valet parking, wifi and use of the gym which closes early as well as the pool which closes at 7. If this is Vegas, the city that doesn't sleep, why does the gym and pool close so early? If I'm paying for it in this fee, I'd like to use it more frequently. It's funny to me that you can go to a cheap motel and get free wifi, but go to a more fancy one and you have to pay for it. The only other thing I tried out in the hotel was Starbucks, which is a rip off. I paid $3.60 for a tall iced hazlenut coffee with no cream. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Oh my gnocchi!! So soft like little pillows that I want to float away with. It came w/ shitake mushrooms that really complemented the cream sauce which wasn't heavy at all. Also the portion was really great too!! Not too much but just right! My hubby had the burger which was good but nothing too special about it. But the fries were good! Get a side of the bbq sauce to dip them in! The only negative was that we opted to sit outside but at a lower table so we were crouching over our food which was uncomfortable but overall great place to check out what kinds of cars are parked in valet!

 lured by the chocolate fountain i decided to investigate. Got hungry so i bought a small dessert and a sandwich. The raspberry macaroon was okay...to me it was a bit too sweet. i thought the fresh raspberry would give it a tart kick but it was actually really sweet. the sugared rose petal on top was pretty cool too. also tried to smoked salmon sandwich which was pretty darn good i must say. The bread looked hard but it was soft and light. it had a good smoked flavor and instead of feeling like a sandwich is compiled of many ingredients it actually was infused together to give it 1 good flavor.

 Went in to browse high end watches Panerai, Breitling, Rolex, Ball etc. But I really wanted to see and purchase a Casio Gshock AWG 1000. Wasted a lot of time waiting for help when help arrived I asked for the specific model salesperson asked if I saw the model in the case. I couldn't tell from across the counter and he told me he had 150000 watches. Not very helpful and not interested in selling a 500 watch. Bottom line don't bother with Tourneau. On the other hand Panerai and Breitling boutiques in the same mall were friendly and willing to show and discuss any model. Btw I was wearing Rolex and have a Panerai. Don't bother with Tourneau.

 The only place I had a shawarma was in Kuwait so I don't have much to compare it to. I will say, the shawarma I had here was a lot different but not in a bad way. It was actually really good, just different. The order came with 2 sides and I chose rice for both. Sides were small. I ended up with more meat than rice. I had to get take out because of my daughter but the environment itself looked like something I can enjoy with my wife. It was $13! Ouch. Over priced in my opinion and that is the reason for the - 1 star. Hope to find other shawarma places that can compete. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Wandered in about 30 mins before they closed and was greeted with a warm welcome and slow blues on the radio. Felt immediately comfortable. Add this place to the Cave Creek Rd list of ""divey on the outside and great food on the inside"" spots. One guy running the show cooking, taking orders and answering the phone but he was friendly and welcoming. Pulled chicken sandwich had a smokey flavor I didn't expect and it was very welcome. Vegetable of the day was sauteed brussels sprouts with almond and bacon. Killed 2 huge mason jar lemonades. I want to give this place 4 1/2 stars. Drawbacks - no lunch specials on the weekend; no beer menu (he told me he's working on the liquor license) but also not byob; weird hours - closed at 8 on Friday and Saturday night and closed Sunday at 4. Those changes would probably make it 5 stars. ",0,0,0,1,0

 BEST HAPPY HOUR OF MY LIFE. I split: -The white Russian: Kahlua, vodka, and a little vial of hot white chocolate that you dump into the drink after it's served. Garnished with two big marshmallows on a stick. -Satisfaction Guaranteed: peanut liquor, caramel liquor, and a little vial of hot milk chocolate served in a stemless martini-type glass and chilled atop a cup of crushed ice. -Mini Philly sliders: shaved rib-eye, cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted pepper mayo on two warm, soft buns. -Carmelized pecans covered in praline and cocoa powder on the way out the door. Everything I ate melted in my mouth, despite being only $6 each. The bartender was also super sweet and friendly, and the presentation of everything blew me away! I'm totally in love with this unique little restaurant and I will be back whenever I'm in Vegas. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I love La Grande Orange. I recently moved to Phoenix and was delighted to find this place in my new neighborhood. Their 24-hour cold brewed coffee is refreshing and flavorful... not watered down even as the ice melts. I am excited to work my way through the many coffees, sandwiches, pizzas, and other menu items - - there are plenty vegetarian options! (They even keep vegans in mind and offer adjustments/alternatives on their menu.) I tried their signature english muffins for breakfast one day, on recommendation of many Yelpers, and they were amazing. I wouldn't pay the price for them every day, but they are a great treat to enjoy with a coffee out on the patio. Downsides: The prices are high. The service is inconsistent... I've been at the barista counter several times and waited for someone to acknowledge my presence. Luckily, when they do, they are nice and my order is up on the counter quickly. It is crazy chaotic most of the day, and gets difficult to navigate through the store without bumping into someone. Luckily, as you weave through the store, you get to look at all of the unique merchandise LGO has to offer, from the perfect handmade greeting card, the small but significant selection of beer, or the coffee table book you never knew you needed.

 Amazing experience! I had some time to kill at the end of my trip to vegas - all of my friends left around 4pm for the airport and I didn't need to be there until 9:30ish. After a weekend of partying and gambling, I was exhausted and didn't feel like aimlessly walking around the strip, so I called around 3pm hoping to get a massage appointment. I was quickly accommodated into a massage slot at 5pm - I honestly didn't have hopes for a same-day massage, so I was pretty impressed. The Spa is beautiful. They have rows of lockers with seriously the most comfortable robe I've ever been in, plush slippers, hair products, face washes, curling irons, straighteners, blow dryers, etc. etc. ETC. Walk a little further and there are large showers and a bathroom area. A few steps after that are the steam rooms, sauna, hot tub, and heated loungers. You are free to use any of these before and after your treatments. All around the spa are water dispensers, a variety of nut/fruit mixes, juice, teas, etc. I got the 50 minute Swedish massage. My masseuse was Natalie and she was WONDERFUL. Catered the massage to me, asking me a few times in the beginning if she should be firmer or lighter and within 5 minutes, I was getting the most perfect massage. I was so relaxed by the end, I could barely even get up to leave. I was shown a meditation room that I could take advantage of if I wanted and I definitely did. There are 6 plush beds, waters, soft serene music, and a waterfall lining one of the walls. I laid down and woke up 1.5 hours later. SO relaxing. Everyone you encounter is friendly and smiling. Everything is kept fully stocked. When the girl facilitating in getting you settled when you first arrive wasn't helping someone, she was constantly making sure the place was restocked and kept beautiful. I absolutely cannot wait to go back and stay longer, get a few other treatments, and get another massage!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I have been to the Villa ANtonio restaurant in Ballantyne many times. I typically get the Chicken Parmesan, always delicious.

Today was my first trip there for lunch. They had the lunch buffet. The lunch buffet was excellent. Good variety, including a salad bar, 3-4 types of pasta (Penne Carbanara, cheese ravioli, ziti w/spinach andd sausage, and a pasta with seafood) , chicken marsala, meatloaf, and minestrone soup. Other reviewers have said the buffet items change. Service was also excellent. The cost was also very reasonable, only $9.99. I plan to eat here weekly now. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ooooool \ u00e9! I don't dabble in The Cardinal Bar very often but now that Cafe Cortadito has opened up shop there (in what apparently used to be the bar's old coat closet), I'll be a regular. From their small space, they dish out delightful meals with a Spanish flair. After a bit of bike riding, my fella and I treated ourselves to their Appetizer Sampler Platter and split The Dirty Bird sandwich. The sampler offered smaller portions of their guacamole and chips, house cured olives, ceviche, croquetas papas and meat croquetas. The croquetas papas were melt-in-your-mouth-and-then-take-a-nap delicious and the ceviche had a light, fresh taste. I'm an olives girl so their house cured ones took the cake for me - a little spice, a lot of salt, a happy Katie. For $11.95, I'd say this was a pretty solid deal considering an order of the ceviche is $8.95 on its own. Share the platter with more than two people though and you might just jeopardize some friendships. You've been warned. The Dirty Bird consisted of chipotle poached chicken thigh with roasted corn, sweet potato, jicama and cilantro slaw all on house-baked bread. Yes. Oh yes. It was a little sweet, spicy and all kinds of nice. Go.there.now. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I have eaten here several times and for the most part, dinning in seems to be a solid 3 stars, maybe 4 if I'm feeling particularly generous. However, I will never be a customer here again, in any fashion. Why? Because of their utter failures in the take out department. 2 flippin times these clowns have ruined our night by butchering our take out order.

Strange, usually I have to order a pizza before I go get it. But not here because they only have two choices: cheese and pepperoni. Except when I went they didn't have cheese so I had to have pepperoni. It was kinda cold, the crust obviously came out frozen from a box before being topped with the crappiest, greasiest cheese ever.

 While Stratosphere may be far from the cream of the crop as LV hotels go, the Top of the World is certainly an exception to the rest of the hotel. Beautiful atmosphere, wonderful meal and great service. We all had the 4 course tasting menu, which for $90, and all things considering, I thought was a very nice price. Especially since the third course, the filet, I would guess at 10 to 12 oz. A far larger portion than I have seen on any tasting menu. While the food was not spectacular, it was certainly very good, and we all enjoyed. The wine pairing for $30 was fabulous, and for me perhaps the best part of the meal. It would have been a bargain for even more. I also highly recommend the bananas foster in a a almond brittlle bowl. The service was excellent, but not rushed at all. Servers were always in the area, but we had a rather slow pace to meal, to enjoy the view. We were there 2+ hours, and since the restaurant slowly rotates, we enjoyed 2 complete rotations, and spectacular views. The atmosphere is quiet on the inside, and the views cannot be beat.

 I am an F&B industry person and it literally hurts my heart to give a 2 star; however, I am rating based on my experience and HOPE that management takes that into account to improve quality and service. And honestly, I would rate 1 star on food but the service made up for the bad experience. Celebrating mother's day weekend, I was looking for a casual place to have lunch and enjoy some shopping. I have my favorite dining spots but wanted to try something different. West Addison at DC Ranch seemed like a good decision but was unfortunately wrong. My BF and I sat at the bar since it was literally empty. That's cool, I like personalized service! No complaints on that. I ordered the Tuna Salad and my BF ordered the Napa Salad. We also ordered the guacamole. 1st of all, the guac was watery and brown. It is on the menu as ""fresh"" but I find it hard to believe. It had ice chips in it and I am pretty sure it came out of a Costco tub or the like. So for my salad, my ""seared"" ahi tuna also came out brown and literally frozen. YUCK! The bartender tells me that they premake and fridge the tuna daily. Sorry, when it comes to raw I prefer made to order and special guidelines apply. It was horrible and I sent it back. The Napa salad that my BF ordered was not very significant at all. The pulled chicken was good and I liked the flavor of the dill ranch but other than that is was just a bed of lettuce. Biggest waste of $35 dollars I have spent in a long time. Good for a drinking spot but the kitchen needs a lot of work! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I love the atmosphere here ! From ping pong ,corn hole to the bar I'm a fan. Culinary Dropout/ the Yard is right down the street from my apartment so I can walk there and not worry about parking. Like most bar/restaurants around the mill ave area parking sucks. So be prepared! The seating within the restaurant is comfortable and eclectic. The crowd is diverse as well ! Service : Interesting to say the least ! She kept walking off in the middle of us ordering. I really could care less about service as long as you are bringing me my food. Food : Pretzel and cheese fondue pretty damn good. The pork belly ramen was pretty bland. Then again I like my ramen spicy! Pricing : Slightly more expensive than most of the restaurants in downtown Tempe. But the atmosphere makes up for the expensiveness in my mind. Also It's one of the nicest places in the area other than La Bocca and House of tricks. Keep in mind this location is still pretty new , so they are still working out the kinks.

 Wish I could give a negative rating. This place came recommended from a friend but I had awful experience there. Maybe some of the artists are really good. The one I wanted had a 6 month waiting list. I took a chance and went with someone else who was available. I was rescheduled 3 times, finally got in 3 weeks later and then the tat was screwed up. I won't go back there again. I asked this artist to do a tattoo the size of a silver dollar and he couldn't do it. I went back the next day while it was healing to get it touched up and it still needs to be fixed. The attitude there was ignorant and arrogant, the artist wasn't listening to what I wanted and then got pissed off when I returned to get a touch up. Hello, this is a permanent mark on me I have to live with. I have a lot of work to get done but wanted to start small and they just couldn't do it. I'm looking for another place. Any recommendations?

 So, it seems Fleur changed their menu quite a bit. Some items I liked are no longer on the menu: In the Shower Mac n Cheese, Croque Monsieur and Almond Panna Cotta. That's ok though, they have similar items. Hubert Keller always serves perfection on a plate! Roasted Bone Marrow: Onion jam, marrow butter, bacon and pain rustic. You just can't go wrong with bone marrow...add bacon to that. Oh c'mon! Worth clogging your arteries for. 5/5 Fried Truffle Mac n Cheese: Truffle bechamel, ham and peas. There's only a few places in town that has good fried mac n cheese - Fleur is one of them. 5/5 Fleur Burger: Wagyu beef, brioche comes with pomme frites. Add Foie Gras and Black Truffles. It's the same as Hubert Keller's (other restaurant) Burger Bar's Rossini burger. Best burger you'll ever eat! Glad they didn't take this off the menu. 5/5 Pot de Creme: Mocha or chocolate. Just coat your tongue with a spoonful of creamy chocolate-y goodness. Trust the French to make good desserts! 5/5 Inside the restaurant, seems dark and more intimate. The service was superb the times I've been here. ",0,0,0,0,1

 My husband and I went in to check this new place out and we were impressed. We sat at the bar and were helped by Jessie and Brandon throughout our visit. They were both very friendly and made sure we never needed anything. I had the macaroni and cheese (without meat for me) and it was, without a doubt, the best macaroni and cheese I have ever eaten. This is not your boring, run-of-the-mill mac'n'cheese, but instead it has a lot of different flavors and the green chilies give it a nice touch of heat without burning your mouth. My husband had the Pub Burger and couldn't stop talking about how good it was afterward. He had never had a burger with an egg on it, but he really liked it and plans to order it again on our next visit. We don't drink beer, but that wasn't an issue since the place has a bar and Jessie makes an incredible margarita. Next time we might try the wine as well since they offer that as well. This is a great new place and we'll definitely be back because I'm already craving that mac'n'cheese! ",0,0,0,0,1

 My secret guilty pleasure as an Italian? I come purely for the breadsticks and alfredo dipping sauce. I could seriously be just fine eating that for dinner. Oh and that awesome little Andie's mint I get with the bill. Plus, I don't mind getting a free sample of wine here and there. That's where OG's have earned their two stars. The reason it's lacking the other 3 stars is due to a couple of things. First, there's always a long wait on Friday and Saturday nights (which I understand) however they don't have very good turnover and they don't quote their wait times accurately. Second off, I have encountered some less than pleasant staff members that I could simply do without. And lastly, their prices keep creeping up and up. I could go get some bomb, scratch-made chicken fettuccini alfredo at Montesano's for the same exact price as Olive Garden's pre-packaged tasting dishes. Meh . ",0,1,0,0,0

 I am in town on an extended visit to help with a sick relative. I needed to get my nails filled and had no idea where to go. I found this place on Yelp and after reading the reviews decided to try it. I was NOT disappointed!! I was a walk-in and got right in. Joan did an excellent job. My nails looked absolutely fantastic and have held up beautifully for the past 2 weeks. I was so impressed that I am going back today to have them done again before I return me. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Surprisingly tasty. Who would have thought that tater tots on a burrito would work? They do, quite nicely on the Hungry Hippie. The husband had the High Roller and he was quite happy with the steak, but particularly the bacon was not cheap bacon, which is always a bonus. And the hot salsa/ sauce (as it is a bit on the chunkier side) is actually pretty hot with decent flavor without singeing off the taste buds. The space is small but apparently they deliver so if you're nearby, then you don't have to worry about finding a space in which to enjoy your yummy deliciousness. They are open late hours, which is also a bonus. Pretty sure when we return to the area, we'll be seeking out this little spot for a meal - good stuff! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ate here a few weeks ago and had a very sub par meal, the manager offered me a ""repeat."" I took him up on it because a $200 steak dinner with a bad steak is never a fun experience.

 Where do I start? I'm writing this review as me and my friend are killing roaches. We called the front desk and someone from maintenance showed up with a can of Raid, you are going to need more than that for this infestation. Also, there is no dresser/closet. The nightstand is disgusting and has some sticky goop on it. The bed covers have cigarette burns on them. The floor is so dirty is leaves your feet black, so...shoes on at all times. The sink handle fell off. The told us the fridge and microwave were an additional $5 each for out entire stay, when the charge went through (which isn't supposed to until we check out) they over charged us by $25. There is no such thing as hot water, if there is, it's warm and lasts about 3 minutes. We have been woken up by god knows what in the room above us as you can hear every footstep. We have been here for 5 nights and we have gone to the ""lobby"" to get out room key to work about 6-7 times, when we asked the lady at the front desk to get us a new key because we were locked out of the room she said: ""I'm in the middle of something, can you wait a few minutes?"" ...um, this is unacceptable, as well as everything else. The breakfast consists of a couple of dried up bagels and coffee (if that's what you call it...) The ""complimentary"" wifi is non existent. Needless to say... We will not be staying here again, and trust me neither should you. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My wife and I have been going here for as long as we have lived in Pittsburgh, which is about 10 years. This is our go-to Chinese restaurant, even after we moved out of the neighborhood. I have never had a bad meal here, and I will forever love their beef chow fun! My wife and I are moving to North Carolina in two days, and Tasty Chinese was the thing about Pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most. These are great folks, and I wish them the best of success in the future. Remember, everyone, just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad! Some people just have lousy taste buds, and many people have no idea what they are ordering to begin with. Try things for yourself, and you will find some great food at Tasty! ",0,0,0,0,1

 First visit last night and I'll be back. Our #evfn group had been invited to meet here this week, and there was a whole room set aside just for us. Service people Brandon and Ashley were cheerful and hopping the whole time. We tend to migrate/socialize table to table and they did an excellent job keeping up with the movement.

 Eh, this just didn't do it for me. It was a huge group of us. We had the VIP booth down stairs. The cabanas upstairs are the shit,we should have gotten one of those. Anyways, the whole VIP area downstairs was way over priced and I didn't think it was worth it. The main dance floor didn't have any music that was made past 2002, seriously. It was nearly impossible to walk anywhere without getting your drink spilled on you. I literally wore my grey goose and red bull down my dress the entire night. The only thing I really liked about this place was the set up. They have a few different areas in the club. Some I never made it to. Overall, I it was OK, hence the 3 stars.

I gave them a call and they said it needs to completely dry and then the bubbles should dry up if not feel free to bring it back. The bubbles did end up drying up after about 5 days.

 The bed was hard and uncomfortable. I barely slept because I couldn't get comfortable and there was a terrible noise that sounded like a really loud water pump going on. The hair dryer was MELTED and when I called for a replacement it took so long that we had to leave before it arrived. It was hanging from the door handle when we got back hours later. I could smell pot coming from down the hall by our room when we checked in and the only person that seemed to be around was the cleaning lady. Our smoke free room had such a strong smoke smell that I had a sore throat in the morning. The water pressure wasn't very good. There were young men loudly having sprint running races in the hall outside our room in the afternoon. (Not exaggerating, they were literally racing the length of the hall for fun, drunk.)

 The staff is very friendly here. Plenty of suits, sports coats, and other clothing to choose from. However, I found the styles and cuts of the suits to be lacking. The stripes of a pin striped suit should match up on the seams, but some of their styled didn't. If I'm going to pay $549 for a suit, it better be well made. I prefer to buy a sports coat here. They're more reasonably priced at around $119 and designed well. The Staff gets 5 Stars in my book. Overall, 3 Stars for the store. Return Factor - 50% ",0,0,1,0,0

 A group of us decided on Jolly Bob's last night to break away from the bitter cold and transport ourselves into a taste of the Caribbean. What an utter disappointment. I have eaten there several times before, although it has been a couple of years, and was very pleased. This time was a tragedy. The Lemon grass Margarita was nice but a little overdone with sweet and sour. I ordered a Mojito at the beginning of dinner but it was terrible. The club soda was flat and the drink was tasteless. The night got worse from there. Three of us had the seafood bisque that was totally cold. The Waitress took 2 back and instead of bringing 2 hot new bowls, she brought the same bowls back and we can only hope that they were given to the right people. The other guest just ate his cold since he was too hungry to wait. I ordered the blackened Mahi-Mahi and it was the worst piece of fish I have ever had, including what I prepared when I was just learning to cook. The piece was tiny and so overcooked I could hardly cut with a knife. My husband ordered the jerk combination and it was cold as well. He didn't send it back but ate what meat he could find around all the fat that made up at least half of his dish. Two guests ordered the Almond Shrimp and it was terrible. The only reason I can give it 2 stars is because the Black Jack fish that I received after sending my blackened Mahi-Mahi back was delicious and finally hot, and the wings ordered by another guest were delish. The original dressings on the salads also made them extraordinary. I really hope they can get their act together soon before it is too late. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Found this place online and decided to take a chance and try it on Tuesday night. The drive north on Central had me a little worried until I got about a block away. What a relief to see a trendy, cozy, but still airy sort of place. Exactly what I wanted in a nice wine bar. My friend and I felt fine in nice jeans and cute tops. This particular day they had a great special. We got a bottle of La Posta wine (I think that was the name) and 4 pieces of bruschetta for $20. The wine was recommended by the waiter...he knew what he was talking about. We got the bruschetta with apples, figs and brie; salmon and capers; prosciutto with figs & marscapone and the last had salami on it. The apple bruschetta was my favorite. I'll be back and will take more friends to experience the food, wine and atmosphere. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Park Place really falls under the heading of ""your home restaurant"" the same way as you have a home church or bar. If you're driving by 51 and 485, stuck at CMC Pineville, or just need a good place to eat, this is the place. If there is anything unusual about the menu, it's the depth. No matter your tastes, you'll find something you like; and it'll be good. I have yet to be disappointed there. Eggs in the morning, a sandwich for lunch, and a filling dinner. On those days when I'm out and hungry, there's no better place to go. When I tire of burgers and chicken fried steak, there's the Greek salad or giro. I like their chicken livers -- they're always good. Breakfast is breakfast. I order the way I want it, they cook it like I tell them and I eat it. That's worth a star all by itself. The portions are generous and the prices reasonable. The wait staff are attentive without being clingy . . . unless you're a regular . . . then everyone from the owner on down stops by to say 'hello.' ",0,0,0,1,0

 Let me preface this by saying that I just got off a plane and was starving and my friends had been rock climbing all day and probably would have thought a Slim Jim was the best thing they ever tasted. When you arrive, you will think you are in the wrong place. It's in a crazy seedy strip mall and at night I had trouble picking this restaurant out of the string of strange establishments. It was so dark that I thought they were closed (none of the strip mall's neon lights were on), but then I saw an open sign. Inside it is nicer. Huge wine selection. On the menu there is an entree specialty section priced in the +$20 range, but the standard menu has lots of options under $10. My 3 friends and I got 4 entrees and two beers for under $50. I may get crap for it, but I always order pad thai as a backup when at a new thai restaurant because it's usually edible, even if the other stuff you order is not. Everything we ordered (cashew nut chicken, lemon pepper pork, yellow curry, pad thai) was great, but I was surprised that the pad thai was phenomenal. The guys in the group were scraping every last peppercorn off the dish. I had to practically stop them from licking the plates! Even if we were biased by hunger, I have had marginal thai food before. This place was fantastic and I would definitely go back. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I love Aj's for a great coffee and ice tea selections and this one has the best selections. The store reminds me of Bristol Farms back home because of the over the top prices. I would rather grocery shop at whole foods and get just as good if not better quality. I mostly grab hot food or something from the bakery. Why the three star? There is one staff member that has the worst attitude. I'm a really soft spoken and sweet person by nature and I am shocked by her actions to customers, even me and all of this is bad customer service is done around her manager and he does nothing. For example, this morning I grab a number and as usual she will quickly call out three numbers at the same time and I pointed to the girl next to me who waited longer and she rolled her eyes at me.

 harper's reminds me of a kid who consistently gets ""A's"", isn't flashy, never causes any problems, and yet, doesn't get the recognition he or she deserves. over the 14 years i've lived in charlotte, i've probably been to harper's 15-20 times - that averages about 1-2 dinners a year. how is that possible? how have i not chosen this restaurant over others that aren't as consistent, well-priced, and just plain good. i've never had anything but great food and service at harper's, and they might just have the best chicken fingers in town. i'm pleased to say that when my husband and i were deciding where to go on saturday night for a 6pm dinner with our kids and my mom, we picked harper's. it was delicious. first of all, it's a beautiful restaurant with servers who are always on top of their game. secondly, it has a huge selection of entrees, wine, and very good kids' meals. my kids split a cheese pizza (and, of course, i had to try a piece). it was ridiculously good. in fact, it was one of the best pieces of cheese pizza i've ever had . . . at harper's. can you believe that? it was thin crust with a ton of gooey cheese, and not too much marinara sauce. honestly, i couldn't believe how good it was . . . but, i'll move on. i had the chicken fingers with two sides - and i picked mac and cheese and vegetables. insanely good. their chicken fingers are so delicious - i could go on for days about those . . . and the mac and cheese was also some of the best i've ever had. i love a gooey mac and cheese where the cheese overtakes the macaroni, and this was definitely that kind of mac and cheese. the veggies could have been cooked a little longer, but they were very good. my husband had the veggie burger, and he couldn't stop talking about how good it was. my mom had a grilled chicken sandwich, and she also thought it was fantastic. the kids each got a scoop of vanilla ice cream (comes with the kids meal - bonus!). for dessert, we all split a hot fudge/ice cream/brownie (with me eating the lion's portion). it wasn't the best hot fudge brownie i've ever had, but i consider myself a dessert connoisseur, and really - can you get a bad one? it was very good. our wine was great, my husband enjoyed his blue moon beers, and all in all, it was a perfect dinner. side note . . . i do have to admit that i had to get up and run 8 miles the next morning because the food was so good that i couldn't leave a morsel on my plate. but it was so worth it - i'd do it all again! go to harper's with or without kids, and you won't regret it. it's a very good meal, reasonably priced, and i bet you'll walk away thinking: ""hmm . . . that was really good. remind me again why we don't come here more often?""

 Being new to Albuquerque I have been doing some exploring. I was on the 40 and had noticed this Old Navy location. I made a mental note and planned on visiting because I need a pair jeans and maybe a shirt. Most of my wardrobe consists of business casual attire. Which is funny because if you have every worked a fast food gig before you remember saying how much you hate the monkey suit they gave you to wear. At least that's how I felt when I was a teenager. Well, fast forward to the future and if you work in an office you are back to that ""monkey suit."" It's a just a more sophisticated uniform. I may have gone a little off there. Let me reel myself in to why I went to Old Navy. I wanted to check the place out because Old Navy is everywhere and there stuff is the same all over the United States. As I walked in I was greeted by the associates. When I approached the men's section I had to check my calendar because this place looked like the day after thanksgiving. The selection was limited, granted it was a Sunday afternoon when I went. I looked around for a few minutes because that's all it took. There was no merchandise. I saw about 250 hooded zipper sweatshirts. I think maybe they had a big shipment or this jacket isn't very popular with the Albuquerque crowd. I need to try and go again. I may see a better selection before the weekend. Old Navy does have some great prices on their clothing. So if you are in the area go check it out. If there is no merchandise in the store, don't panic they didn't have a robbery! Cheers! ",0,0,1,0,0

 This was a horrible place. My husband and I wanted to upgrade our bed when we moved into our new home. We found big red mattress on craigs list and went to check them out. We dealt with the manager Jim. He was such a condescending ass. He was worse then a sleazy car salesman. The initial visit went well of course because that's the day we were purchasing. After we had already purchased and went back to schedule delivery it was horrible from that time on. Jim couldn't find our paperwork, we almost didn't receive the four $80 pillows we had purchased an his math was off so our deposit wasn't credited to our account. After they delivered the mattress the first couple nights we loved it. Then on the left side of the bed it started sagging and you felt like you were going to roll off in the middle of the night. When we contacted Jim to let him know our concern he was extremely irritated and acted as if he didn't believe us. He said he has never had a problem with that mattress ever so it was impossible that we had a problem. We told him to please come look at it and we would show him. He came to our house and because the problem with the bed was when you were laying on it and not visible to the naked eye while not in use he didn't want to warranty the bed. (The sagging was only visible to the naked eye when you sat on it) He was so rude an argued with my husband in front of our children in our home about the exchange. He said he was doing us a huge favor by even considering to make things right. He then said he would replace the mattress without using the warranty company for us. Then after my husband was upset with his behavior he said if we weren't planning on purchasing our other beds through him why would he make good on the warranty and he would take photos of the bed to submit to the warranty company so that the claim would be declined and we would just be out the 1500 dollars we spent with them. Then he changed his mind again and said he would replace it for us through the store after my husband pointed out the fact that he was not appreciative of his threats. After he finally left we were both so disgusted with the way he treated us it was just unbelievable. That was the worst part of all the mistakes, his unprofessionalism. Then when we received the new mattress they didn't call us to tell us they were on their way, so I had to move a few things out of the way for the delivery guys and while I was trying to do this I had three screaming babies at all the commotion my dog was making. I couldn't figure out why my dog was going so viscously crazy until I walked to the front door to let them in and saw the delivery guy hanging over my fence whistling and teasing my dog. Then when they came into the house one of them acted like he was the owner of the company asking all kinds of questions and totally acting as if he had a say in the exchange. I was unaware of who he was so I took the time to explain to him the issues thinking he was maybe a partner or something. He proceeded to tell me that the mattress he was delivering was more firm then the one he was taking and that was alarming because it was supposed to be replaced by the exact same mattress!! Then he said he saw some extremely light light finger marks that were barely visible. He said he was going to call Jim and tell him the mattress was dirty and acted as if he wasn't going to make the exchange. I told him this is ridiculous you can't barely see them and he had me get a rag and wipe them up which in turn made them visible. His attitude didn't change until I became frustrated and started taking names and asking questions about the owner information an the warranty company info. It was at that point that I was told Jim was not the owner of the company as he had stated to us previously, he was the manager, and the rude delivery guy was just that, a delivery guy named George. I have never in my life been treated so poorly, I couldn't believe it. We spent 1500 dollars with them and had planned on spending 1800 more with them next month to finish our kids rooms and then another 2600 the following month to finish our second home. Obviously that's not going to happen now and we are going to make sure we let anyone and everyone know of the horrible experience we had with him. My husband works with the public on a daily basis an gives an receives recommendations all the time and he will definitely be warning people of our experience. I have several moms groups that I belong to and my church group and we give and receive recommendations also and I will be letting them know of how awful we were treated by them. Now we have a 1500 dollar mattress with NO WARRANTY! When I called to get an address to send a complaint letter to corporate I accidently got a hold of the actual owner of the company Bobbie. He did listen to our complaint and asked what he could do to make it right, but in all honesty this problem was not a matter of material compensation. ",1,0,0,0,0

 They have Bells Oberon on tap here!! Get it while you can you guys!! We got here jus in time for the happy hour menu which was perfect. My friend and I shared the potato cakes, sliders, fries, and soft pretzel. The sliders and fries were so good! We honestly probably would have been full if we had jus stuck with that but the other two items were pretty decent also. Next time id like to get there in time for the fancy menu!!! ",0,0,1,0,0

 For a $5.00 matinee ticket, absolutely zero complaints here. The theatre & restrooms were clean, (the gold standard in my book), the theater itself was a comfy temp.,didnt need the hoidie I carried in. I am not one to blow dough on concessions, so can't comment on their prices, but overall a great experience. The seats are roomy, floors non-sticky, & I will def. visit again. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Today was the 3rd time I've been to 28GO. I've been meaning to write the review weeks ago, but I've been behind on my Yelping. Right away I must recommend everyone try their Golden Tea; it's unique, delicious, and healthy. It's nutty and sweet, if you try it you won't miss having a sugary soft drink. For food, I highly recommend any of the Ramen dishes. I've had the Miso Mazin and the Herbal Chicken, both were excellent. The stars I'm giving 28GO is an average of the 3 visits. The second time I was there I tried one of their stuffed waffles, and they were very bland. A 2 star dish, I personally think they should remove the waffle section from their menu. That's just my opinion; I won't order them again. The Ramen dishes are all 5 star. The Herbal Chicken brought back long forgotten memories of soup my grandmother used to make. The dish has a unique balance of sweet and savory, almost predominantly sweet but in a good way. If you're not used to the flavor you may not like it as much as me. If you order any of the Ramen dishes, don't order any other food dishes unless you're extremely hungry or dining with someone else. It's a lot of food. I tried one of their tapas dishes, the Belly Rice. It definitely wasn't tapas sized, a lot of food, and a uniquely tasty flavor combination. I ordered it and the Miso Mazin Ramen together, and was forced to gorge myself to discomfort because I was raised not to let food go to waste. I recommend 28GO. ***** Best music I've ever experienced in a restaurant. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Freaking good Pizza! We got the ""New Nicoles Favorite"" which was basil, feta, and something else. The pizza was deicious and fresh and paired perfectly with a glass of red wine. They offer convenient online ordering options and though they are tucked away in a shopping center, their customer service is on point. They had my order hot and ready at the promised time. I guess my ONLY critique would be I wish they put a *little* more sauce on the pizza, but that is just my personal preference. I will definitely be treating myself to Spinato's - glad to have found a good local pizza joint! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Not coming back. The last few times I have been they have been lousy with scheduling. The final straw was When they asked me to come back in an hour and when I did they had me wait 15 minutes to get to a chair. After they seated me and my feet were already soaking they then said it would be another 20 minutes. Which ended up being closer to 30. It was a huge waste of time.

 This place is your typical sports bar... A ton of TVs and pool tables. If you are sports fan, this is where you want to go to watch your favorite games. UFC Fights are shown with a $5 cover. If you are a fan of Fox and Hound and their food, you will live this place as they are from the same group. We experienced very good service on my most recent trip. Does this place have something that will make me want to become a regular? No, but it's a nice spot to watch a special sports event or share a few drinks as there isn't a plethora of bar options in the Ballantyne area. I'm giving it 3 stars because I wasn't wowed or found myself clamoring to come back. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This was my first time at First Friday. A friend of mine came to visit and I took her there along with a few friends. We parked at the El Cortez and took the free shuttle across the street of the main entrance to the event. There were a lot of people of all ages kids as well wasn't expecting them to be out late. There were art galleries ofcourse, vendors, food trucks of all sorts and one of them had funnel cakes. There were 2 or 3 stages playing music. One of the stage was set up on top of a truck.. An area with rap music where a girl was rapping. Lots of neat art stuffs. We took the open top Big Bus back to El Cortez and sat on the top level of the bus which was so cool.

 the lighting in the photos made this all-white restaurant looked really good but in person, they looked like cheap plastics. came here on a weeknight at around 9.30pm. very empty but better than crowded. the view was nice because we're on the top floor, but ok because there was nothing else besides lighted houses. goat cheese w/whatever- do not like this because i don't like goat cheese. the top part that comprises of whatever was pretty good. roast maine lobster w/au curry & coconut rice- an american cum indian cum thai dish. very interesting. good this because it sounded so fusion. when i had my first bit at the threesome, all i could think of was how interesting it tasted. it wasn't phenomenal or aweful, but just not bad. not bad in an interesting way. i'm not even sure the coconut rice was made to have that kind of texture. lobster was well cooked just like the many i'd tried. chicken dish- can't remember the name but it baasically comprises of 2 chicken breast with a different marinate. one's good, one's so-so. skin's a little too salty but was cooked well. anybody who cooks knew that chicken was not an easy animal to cook. not easy to get it juicy and tender. one of the chicken was about 0.09% too dry. candy bar(dessert)- our server twice what this was but still couldn't catch it. way too many layers. however, i love this for the taste of chocolate cake and candy. something like brownie, chocolate something and toffee. maidelaine dipped in hazelnut chocolate cream- very good maidelaine. cream was good, not too sweet. our server was very cool and nice. they had bathrooms at 2 different location. one's at the restaurant itself and the other was at the adjoining lounge(which played some kinda euro/trance music i think). opted for the lounge because he mentioned the view. oh boy oh boy... sitting on the toilet bowl enjoying the magnificent view(of Mandalay Bay) was just awesome. it wasn't really the view but it was just sitting on the toilet bowl at the highest floor.

 We have used AZ concept for our Solar Hot water and solar system. I have read these reviews and what people forget about is that there are many company's out there selling solar. The utility companies are backed up three months or more. When ours was finally installed about 3months ,which we were advised of by solar concept. SR said they were sorry but it takes this long right now. After everything passed that day SR advised would be a minimum of 3wk before it would be turned on, was about 31/2wk This was of no fault of AZ CONCEPTS. They have been great to work with, when I had questions, they answered them for me. We are very happy with the SOLAR HEATER AND SOLAR on our home. The installers that put the solar heater and the panels on our roof were very kind and courteous. You don't see that in workers today ",0,0,0,0,1

 SO I have been visiting Mark Rich's for years regularly for their good ol lunch specials. Where else can you take three people for lunch and the bill comes out to $15.00??? What??? I must say I know how good this place can be and its been a while since I have seen it. The place always used to be rockin and now you go in and theres hardly anyone there. Like I said we come for lunch....rarely for dinner so it may just be a lunch thing? The last time I visited we were the only ones there. The service is always pretty good so no real complaints there. We always order the garlic knots. Love them. Love love love. We usually ask them to do ""light"" on the oil but this time we forgot. Dangit. It was swimming in oil....and by swimming I mean the poor knots were crying for help. We ate it anyway as we dabbed as much oil as we could. For lunch we ordered the pasta lunch. We always order the penne pasta with pink sauce. Its not really on the lunch menu but they modify their spaghetti for an additional charge for the pink sauce. The last couple times the pasta just has zero flavor. This last time the noodles were mushy, the sauce had no flavor and the garlic bread was burnt. Well actually I had a burnt piece and a good piece and same for the BF. This place is just tired. It needs a new lift or something. I am so sad to say all this because I have always been a big fan of their pizza and pasta. Occasionally you would see Mark in there greeting the customers and I havent seen him in years. Maybe its the new location. Who knows. We do always make fun of all the celebrity pictures autographed by someone with the same pen and same writing. Pretty amusing I must say. Anyways, I think we will give this place a rest for now and maybe visit for dinner to change it up. I havent given up on you yet Mark. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Was on a birthday weekend trip with some friends. I have rented from RTR online previously with good experiences, and had walked by the storefront on a previous trip. Unfortunately, I was unimpressed. The selection is minimal, and some of the dresses show significant wear. For example, there was a dress hanging up that had significant pilling on it; so much that it looked like something from Goodwill instead of a runway caliber dress. Another was missing a bunch of sequins. I was also unhappy with the fact that only some of the dresses display rental pricing, and that the pricing is (at least for all the dresses we picked out) was the same as on the website. Not terrible, until you remember that the website rents for 5 days, versus 1 night in store. In the future, I'll stick to renting online simply because I know I'll find something. If you're planning a trip to the store, make sure you have brought a back up dress in case you can't find anything. I still gave 3 stars because everyone was very helpful and friendly. I found a dress I loved, but nothing ended up being right for a Vegas night out, so I didn't get anything. Furthermore, none of the sales people were pushy when I finally gave up, and they didn't try to force a rental on me. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The other night was my first visit to this gem! My first thought as I came in the door was how good the food smelled! It is small and you are served at long tables or at the bar. Part of it's charm is you never know who you might be seated with. Seating might be a bit tight but it isn't bad. I am also surprised it isn't noisier for as small and compact as it. The food and the way it is served is what you'd expect to fin in Spain. You get exactly what you order so it is fun to choose what you want as you put together your choice of a meal The servings are not large but are well appointed with excellent sauces. Visually they are a delight just to have put before you. Maggie, our server, provided flawless service. She knew the menu and made excellent suggestions concerning the food. It will be a great place to take a group of friends for a relaxed, excellent meal. My potato tart was lite and the eggplant and the way it was served was as good as I can remember having. I give the restaurant five stars for being unique and fun with and having what excellent food! If you have to wait, just the smell of the food as you walk in the door will tell you it is worth it.

 Sunshine Baskets & Gifts is a wonderful surprise for a any person looking for some help with gift wrapping during the holiday season. One would think there would countless wrapping services available in Las Vegas during the holiday season. Well, there's not. Unless you buy your gifts at a specific location that offers wrapping during the holidays OR you want a Girl Scout's weary mother handling your precious gifts, you will be wrapping the gifts yourself. And outside of the Christmas holiday there are only two business that I know of who offer a wrapping service: Alligator Soup and Papyrus. They were the only businesses offering this service during the ""off season"" in the whole town. So you can imagine my joy at discovering Sunshine Baskets & Gifts---they not only did a lovely job with my gift wrapping, but the owner and her husband were kind and provided excellent service. I know purists want the joy of wrapping each and every gift themselves. I have no such desires. Days before Christmas I needed MANY gifts wrapped and I had little to no time to do it. I contacted Sunshine Baskets & Gifts and the owner, Kathleen, arranged her schedule so that I could bring over 20+ packages to be wrapped. I took some paper, my credit card, and my pre-labeled gifts. Kathleen promised to use some of her own paper if mine ran out. What really impressed me about Sunshine Baskets & Gifts was their willingness to go above and beyond to make my life a little easier. I told her I was planning to ship a few of the packages and she offered to box and ship them for me. It took some trust to leave a number of gifts with a stranger (not associated with the Post Office, UPS, Fedex, or any other such entity). But I took the risk. And I'm glad I did. The gifts arrived on time and according to my family, they were all beautifully wrapped. And I was very pleased with the rest of the gifts that I picked up the next day. In all, I spent about $100 for the entire service. With paper, decorations, labor, shipping, and boxing during the craziness of the Christmas season, I felt like I was very fairly charged. This is not a huge operation. This is two considerate people who care about providing good service. I was happy with the workmanship and I intend to use their services in the future. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Our two-night stay at the Shadyside Inn involved three suites and was like a god damn roller coaster ride. First of all, it's a bizarre concept with a bizarre aesthetic. Our suite was essentially a small apartment in a decrepit, tacky building across the street from the main facility. After somehow making it up the steepest driveway of all time, and somehow stumbling across our rooms in the completely unmarked hallways, we actually found that they were quite nice looking. Felt very much like college dorm rooms - but they were serviceable and clean. Too clean - it turns out. After we had barely settled in, my cousin came running into our room screaming like a banshee holding out hands covered in soap. ""IT'S NOT COMING OFF! IT WON'T COME OFF!"" Turns out every single piece of brown furniture in all of our suites was covered with furniture polish that stained our clothes and stuck on our hands. We called the office, and were put on hold for ten minutes. Finally went over across the street, and the staff ended up being very gracious. Apologized profusely, offered to pay to have our clothes cleaned, and removed the guilty furniture from our rooms. Everyone received an apology letter explaining the oversight. We received special attention as the first guests to fall prey to this cruel trick, and received a handwritten apology from the management and two bottles of cheap merlot. Everything else went smoothly until check-out day. We were heading to a college graduation ceremony and intended to drive, but were forced to walk due to the Pittsburgh Marathon route. When we called the office to ask if it were okay for us to leave our luggage in our rooms until slightly after check out time (HALF AN HOUR ONLY), they flat out refused to allow it. After shit-fits were thrown and our varnish-debacle resurrected, they allowed us to leave our cars in the lot with the luggage in the trunks, which they initially tried to refuse permission for us to do. Needless to say, we did not leave happy campers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 1st let start out by saying I was planning on going to Rolling Smoke. I saw the incredible reviews and failed to notice they are closed on Sunday. So after two weeks of no meat and pushing my fitness training to the next level I was ready for something fun to eat and I had a taste for BBQ! I got in my car and drove down to rolling smoke just to learn that it is a ghost town on Sunday....agggghhhhh! Ok so Yelp helped me find this place let me find the second best reviewed. So number two is Top Notch but that's the opposite direction to home for me and I already made a fool of myself driving down to Highland so what is rated decently but on the way back or up by my house. Oh yeah Hogs Heaven Barbecue Decatur Blvd Northwest cool I'll go there. Double checked and Sun 11 am - 9 PM that works its not even 6 PM. So from Highland I drive North past my house to Hogs Heaven just learn this place looks like it has gone out of business. I sent a not to Yelp to say it looks closed. Wow this Sunday can't get much better 1st I pull a dumb move ok I deserve the 1st one but the second one... so needless to say I didn't eat here because it was closed! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Intrigued by the idea of a Chinese/Mexican restaurant. Since it's not actually fusion because there are separate Mex and Chinese items, you would think that they'd be masters of both Chinese and Mexican cuisine.

 This place is great! Love the Dr.'s and Staff too! Unfortunately, when I asked for my PD (pupillary distance) from them so I could order my glasses from Warby Parker, they refused. They said if I ordered my glasses through them, it would be no problem, but since I wanted to order from another company, they couldn't give me that info. It is too bad that one little thing will ruin a relationship with a customer. They get near sighted into looking at the immediate worth of a customer and not look at the lifetime value of one. Especially someone who has a young family and has already referred customers to them. I wish them luck in the future and hope this helps shape how they look at their customers in the future.

 I was told, when placing my reservation, that the patio was full so the hostess would seat us next to a large open window with a nice view of Camelback Mountain. What she really meant was that they would seat us in the back of a room so far from the large open door the only view was of the tables in front of us. I ordered the special of the day, New England clam chowder, one of my favorite soups, so I knew what to expect. Unexpectedly I received runny soup that only resembled the same color as clam chowder with far less of the yummy ingredients that I would have expected from such a pricy place. We also decided to split a nice wedge salad. Having eaten wedge salads in hundreds of other establishments, we thought for sure that this staple of fine dining was easily replicated by any restaurant and felt comfortable with our decision. When we received our salad, the runny blue cheese dressing was void of any real blue cheese and after my wife and I split up the bacon bits, we each got three bits of bacon. My wife enjoyed a petite filet and decided to add shrimp to the meal. For an extra 16.00 we got 3 small shrimp that were over cooked. $5.3333 per shrimp is a little outrageous. Overall, the meats were well prepared, the service was very acceptable, the ambiance is fantastic but the food was sub-standard at best compared with other restaurants of similar price range.

Not only did this store NOT have ANYTHING in my size (which they used to) the staff was unpleasant and the store was rather filthy. I was shopping for a corset and after waiting 45 minutes for the dressing room, the woman commented how ""we have a waiting line and if I have to lace you up for each...."" I was livid. They made me feel completely dissatisfied and certainly not sexy. I will no longer shop here and I will be hesitant to provide them anymore of my online business. I left this store in tears.

 Don't really eat Mexican food out much. Usually prefer the homemade stuff. In Vegas though I don't get much of that either so I decided to venture and try this place based on the great reviews. We tried the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, mini-molletes, and a quesadilla arabe. I got the chipotle sauce from the quesadilla on the side, just in case. It wasn't too spicy but had delicious smoky flavor. If you're a bit shy with spicy food, ask them to try the sauce before you order, they're happy to comply.

 Located smack bang in the middle of town, so handy for catch ups and a cuppa before having to run for the train or bus.

 One of the best steakhouses in Vegas. They start the meal with complimentary fries made in duck fat with three dipping sauces, a nice change from the bread course. We then had Instant bacon and a dozen oysters. The bacon was great. Bacon is a hot dish right now at steakhouses and there's was among the best if not the best. Oysters were good but I hate when there is any she'll and every oyster had a little bit of shell. The steak shined. I had the Wagyu rib cap and it was incredible. I had it once at Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse, which was excellent but this was transcendent. I almost did not order because at Mina's SF steak house, Bourbon, it was VERY mediocre. Again, one of the best pieces of meat I have ever had. Sides were great. Everyone, myself included loved the Russell sprouts but I personally enjoyed the truffle Mac cheese the most. It had a full truffle flavor that stood up to the whole meal. Normally, I avoid the desserts but because everything was so good and they did not disappoint. The cheese cake had a lime filling that was incredible and the tartness worked very well. We tried a couple other desserts, which were also perfect, but I forgot exactly which ones. Overall, a fantastic evening. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I used to live right up the street from this restaurant and as a result came here several times. I don't think that there is any way I'd return though. I have literally never felt good after eating here - whether it was a hazy, late night encounter and getting sick in the morning, or more of a standard evening dinner and getting sick at night. Maybe I'm allergic to some sort of special, exclusive ingredient they use... ",0,1,0,0,0

 I know people will still come and eat here even after reading all the horrid reviews.. But seriously though, this place has a bunch of dumbasses working here. I called around 10:35 at night no one picked up... I called back in ten minutes... No answer... By the way, all this is happening Ehile driving there...I end getting there and see all the workers outside smoking.. No one was inside at all! The phone was ringing off the hook. Customers were waiting for their pizza also. This will be the last time I ever come here ever. Dear Management if you are reading this, I advise you to fix this piece of shit location.

 OK, the place is a little awkward and is a spacial nightmare. It feels weird to be seated in some areas, like you are jammed in, but the tacos make up for it. Never had bad service, but I have had to get someone's attention before for another beer or refill. Chips and Salsa and awesome! The Carne Asada tacos are the bomb! The Sangria is good too. The beer is always cold and Happy hour is awesome! Perfect place to eat before a movie at the AMC. They have the same great empanadas like Fuego Bistro, which are really good.

 Since my wife and I moved to Las Vegas (this year), we have been looking for Chinese delivery as good as what we were used to getting in Los Angeles. Joyful House the best we have found yet. It is not delivery, but the takeout service was quick and attentive. Appetizers - the Crab Rangoon and Potstickers were good. The Crispy Fried Prawns were a bit thick on the breading, but the prawns themselves were flavorful. Main dishes - The Beef Tenderloin Mignon With Onion really was filet mignon, so far as I could tell. Very tender and flavorful, and they didn't skimp on the beef. The Sweet and Sour Pork was also flavorful, with only a hint of toughness; and the sauce did not drown out the flavor of the pork. The soft Pan Fried Noodles With Chicken was also well-prepared, with small but tender chunks of chicken breast. The prices were a little more than what we are used to, which is odd because coming from Los Angeles almost everything is much cheaper in Las Vegas. While we have not quite given up on trying some other places, we would be entirely satisfied to stick with Joyful House as our ""go to"" Chinese food in Las Vegas. ",0,0,0,1,0

 After further consideration, this store does not deserve a 4 star review. The Old Navy product has been pretty weak recently, which isn't the store's fault, but the severe lack of customer service doesn't help the situation. While shopping here on Friday, I was one of maybe 3-5 people in the store. I would practically walk into a sales associate but not even receive a glance or smile. No one working here seems to give an iota whether or not product is being sold. To avoid inconveniencing the associates, I will be taking my Old Navy purchases online in the future. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Pros: Not far from where I live. Relatively cheap. Love getting their large house combination rice for $7.30. Duck sauce! Quack. Cons: Ridiculously inauthentic. Egg rolls contain no meat whatsoever. Definitely not a fan of the service. The workers can be very rude and impatient and sometimes make fun of customers within earshot.(Although i've also talked about customers that get on my nerves, at least I whisper) The only reason why I go here is because it's a stones throw away from where I live. If that wasn't the case....I probably wouldn't bother. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Get here early if you go on Friday night. Otherwise you will wait 20 minutes for a table or else sit in the bar. The Bar isn't bad because they do have tables. This is very good que. They cook the whole pig but it's not really smoked or seasoned too much. They let you add the vingegar based sauce or the tomato based yourself. They have an excellent choice of combo items on the menu. Ribs and chicken or chicken and catfish or any combination with ribs and pulled pork or even chicken wings. Parking can be a tough. The service is good and the prices are fair as you get good sized portions. I'm not real keen on their sauce which is kind of a bummer because they don't really season their meat too much. I like that they have a full bar and if you order a beer you get a 16 oz pint glass that's frosted. Tonite, Liz took care of us...she calls everyone honey. She made sure everything is good. She made regular visits but didn't intrude. I remember back in that late 90's this was Pucketts General Store. I just love being in the real south. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I had been wanting to try this place because I'd heard about the milkshakes, so we finally got there on our last Vegas trip. I had the Kobe slider trio and hubby had just a regular BLT burger. We got the skinny fries, which were good, but the table next to us had onion rings which looked awesome, and we wished we'd gotten those instead. The sliders were good-the blue cheese one was really rich but the bbq onion one was tasty. We got the twinkie milkshake to finish and sweet baby jeesus-it was huge, and delish!! Very sweet though and we couldn't finish it. The restaurant was pretty and service was good-waitress was friendly and kept our water glasses full. I'd go back simply to try more of their milkshakes!!! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Great store with tons of great pieces and basics. This is the Uniqlo/GAP/H&M of London. Much of the stuff is expensive for what it is, but you can find a good deal. They have some great shoes and dresses for reasonable prices. The jewelry section is amazing and I was so tempted to buy a bunch of stuff. I also like that they have a 10% discount for students, woo. I bought a cute polka dot dress (somewhat retro), some cute flats, and socks. Some of the loafers they have are cute and all leather but pricey for what I was looking for... $65 for cheap loafers... decided to spend that on my dress! And the dress is machine washable! Sizing is a little odd... I'm usually a 0 or 2, and a 4 in my dress fit me ok. The 2 was too tight. Odd. Definitely need to try before you buy here. The dressing rooms are spacious and nice. They're a bit understaffed though. All the clothes are on trend and will be standout pieces in your wardrobe... this is more than I can say for Uniqlo/GAP who specialize in the basics. Definitely worth a stop to shop. After I purchased my goods and walked around to other stores and other malls, people actually stopped me to ask me about Topshop. I guess it's pretty popular since it's so new in Vegas. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Have I finally taken my fill of flashing lights, tasseled pasties, chiming slots and waiting in lines for Vegas clubs on the strip? Not yet. But Body English clamped a lid on my Vegas spirit (or killed my buzz) my first night on my trip. Thank god for Jet on Saturday! So, first a full disclosure. I'm giving Body English 2.5 neutral stars because I did not go inside. I have been to Vegas numerous, multiple, did I mention many? times and know the routine - it's always risky to go to clubs without an ""In."" I understand the drunken f***s that bouncers are up against. But BE sucked ass. Me and two of my friends (all guys) joined the pack outside BE around 11:30pm. The lack of any line structure led to pushing from behind by impatient clubbers, and pushing from the front by inflated dimwit bouncers. A cabby later told me that the Hard Rock Casino didn't double-down on clubbing when it was built and had to retrofit space later, causing lines to spill out into the casino. Since when did a Casino do something on the cheap? Women could get in pretty easily but dudes were screwed. I was reminded of agonizing times outside clubs in Miami soliciting pity from random women - offering to ""please let us pay your cover and buy you and all your friends drinks for the night so we can get in!"" I'm not arguing against having a good ratio of women to guys, but give me a little false sense of hope please! Obviously the bouncers were holding out until midnight when free entrance passes would expire. Other friends found some women yet still had to bribe the Fabio wannabe bouncer $200 on top of paying $30 cover each. We capped our bribe at $80 but gave up -- BE smelled thick of inflated demand by keeping a crowd outside. This club didn't feel worth its fake hype. We felt good about bailing despite having wasted an hour and a half of our precious drinking/dancing/gambling/sinful time. I don't mind waiting, I don't mind the hustle, but I do mind the lack of respect, and the lack of lines or sense of what it takes to get in. (0 * stars) ",0,1,0,0,0

 I only ran into this place to use the bathroom. Had to show my ID before i walked in though. Standard Procedure! i walked in and immediately everyone stared at me like ii didn't belong there. A bunch of folks all sitting at the bar. Most of the seats were taken and it was pretty dark and crummy in their. No decorations only beer signs. i believe they had specials on beer and drinks but from the looks of the place thats all they had to offer. When i walked into the ladies room I was immediately turned off. 1. No lock on the bathroom door 2. Only 1 toilet 3. No door on the stall So let me tell you how this went. I walked into the bathroom and closed the door behind me. I went to lock it after noticing that there was only one toilet in the bathroom. To the left was the sink and paper towels. The only thing separating the toilet from the sink was a measly shower curtain hung by zip ties!! I mean really...zip ties. They couldn't even buy real shower curtain rings. When i tried to slide the curtain shut i had to move it inch by inch because it was too tightly hung. Seeing that there is only one toilet and the few people who saw me go inside the stall, i figured i would have my privacy but of course that didn't happen. 30 seconds into my curtain pulling. Two drunk women stumble in loud and laughing meanwhile leaving the door to the girls room open. Did i mention the bathroom is right next to the bar!! So i had to announce to them i was using the toilet, God forbid they open the curtain!!. They were laughing and taking pictures while i'm praying that they leave soon or just don't pull the curtain back. I've never had such a uncomfortable experience using the bathroom in my life. This is what it must feel like to be a prison inmate. No privacy, no respect and no doors!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have been to practically every spa and salon in the valley searching for a great nail salon. My friend worked at the Village as a camp counselor and he suggested I check their salon out. I was sadly disappointed. When I originally called to make an appointment the receptionist was rather rushed and sounded inconvenienced by my call. I am an understanding person so I didn't really think much of it. My friend and I went in on the day of our appointment and were still asked to wait for about 20 minutes because the nail tech hadn't come back. Again, I am not really impatient or unreasonable so it didn't really bothered me. The thing that pushed me over the edge was the nail tech. My friend was getting a pricier manicure and the tech was very personable and friendly to her. Because I had gotten my nails done only a week earlier I asked for an express manicure instead. She rushed through and was extremely rude to me. I definitely walked out with a bad taste in my mouth about the whole experience and was not happy when I still was paying a relatively high price for my manicure. Maybe I caught everyone on a bad day but I would suggest looking somewhere else unless you absolutely have to get your nails done um, at a health club? ",1,0,0,0,0

 I was in town for a conference and tried this place after reading the reviews. We were greeted by the hostess quickly and waited at the bar for our table. The bartender was attentive and served us a couple of drinks. The ambiance is actually quite nice and cozy as folks have mentioned. Our wait time to be seated was also about 40 minutes, so i would recommend coming when less busy or for happy hour and grabbing a seat at the bar. The waitress seemed rather rushed and not attentive, as we had to ask for water. Additionally, it was odd that the waitress did not even go over any of the daily specials noted on the chalkboards. We ordered a fish taco special noted on the chalkboard and a relleno platter as well. Both dishes were served rather late, after about 20 minutes of waiting. The place was not really packed by the time we were seated. The main courses were fair, but nothing really to write home about. I was definitely expecting more. We did try the flan, which was quite good. The overall rating would have been three starts if our service was improved and the waitress took time to be more attentive and explain the menu items.

 How is there a line when nobody shops here? I used to live down the street from this dump of a grocery store, and would not recommend shopping there. The produce appears to sit for longer than it should due to the lower volume this Vons does. This means you may not be so excited to pick up those peppers and spinach and bring them home to your family. The store's appearance is dated, and not maintained very well. I have never seen more than one cash register open, which means that when you and the other 6 people in the store check out, you'll be waiting for a while. On top of that, the employees seem just as unhappy as you to be there. Since there are so many options for groceries in town, choose ______ instead. (It doesn't matter what you fill the blank with, it will be better than this place.) ",0,1,0,0,0

 My boyfriend and I stayed here over Memorial Day weekend. I would say that our experience there was OK, but not quite what we were expecting. 1) When we checked in, they recommended that we ""upgrade"" to a room in the West Wing. After walking what felt like at least a 1/4 mile to get to our room (through a very dark, narrow hallway), we got to our tiny room. There was only one small window over the bed, and the room in general was very dark. We then walked the 1/4 mile back to the front desk and requested a room change and we were put in a Grand Tower room (which is what we had reserved in the first place). I will say that we were very happy with our Grand Tower room. It was somewhat basic, but very clean and I loved the Jasmine scented bath products. 2) I felt like we were on Spring Break, except that we would have enjoyed that ten years ago. Picture people running through the halls at 2a.m. screaming, wasted people hanging out in the lazy river drinking (and I am assuming not getting out to pee. ew!), it got old very quickly. The worst part was that I felt like it was no place for the few families that we saw who were trying to actually use the lazy river for it's intended purpose. Little kids really shouldn't have to fight their way through a crowd of wasted dudes to enjoy the pool! 3) I did really love the restaurants. We had an amazing dinner at Nobhill Tavern, and great sandwiches at 'wichcraft 4) I liked the location, we were able to get to the tram that takes you from the Excalibur to Mandalay Bay pretty quickly, and we took the Deuce to the Bellagio which was also very quick and easy. 5) The staff was very helpful and polite. Everyone we met was very courteous and friendly. Especially a nice man on the housekeeping staff who explained that the red dot next to our room number meant that our window was designed for helicopter pickups in the event of a fire! He told us not to jump heh heh. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Ah, another day, another new buffet! :-)) So Here's ""Golden Nugget Chinese Buffet"". It's beyond scary from the front, so I put off eating here for nearly a year, but today was the day to fight off several temptations & finally give it a try. It's a small place, seating 36 inside plus some shaded patio tables out front. Temptation #1 was that I had to drive past Best Wok Buffet at 51st Av. & McDowell to get to this place. Now Best Wok (* * *) is no Zen/Jen, but it's practically free at $4.25 & you just can't go wrong for the price. (I eat there all the time.) Temptations #2 & 3 are that there is the big ""New China Buffet"", nearly 4-Stars, right across the street, & also 4-Star Sizzler (Buffet), right over there, too. Then there's THIS place! Eek!! Is it too late to change my mind? \ u00bf? :-O Ok, I stayed. Here it is... The EXCELLENT: * The Egg Foo Young! (Amazing!!) * The Pork Fried Rice! The VERY GOOD: * The Chicken Chop Suey! * The Chow Mein! * The Sweet & Sour Shrimp! * The Fried Chicken! (Not wings, but tasty little filets cut from thighs!) The NOT-SO-GOOD: * Mr. China, the unfriendly host. * The small selection of only 16 items... no fruit or salad. * The inescapable glary light coming in from outside. Lunch Buffet $5.77. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I wanted to love this place, but in the end - I loved the service and the food was ok. Basically I gave the food 3 starts, but my server Jamie got 5 stars so I compromised with a 4 star review. My steak was good - I ordered it medium rare and it was a lot closer to rare - but hey, I am adventurous. My garlic mashed potatoes were over salted - not to the point of inedible - but definitely noticeable. The appetizer was a bacon wrapped scallop - the scallop was well cooked, but completely overpowered by the bacon. Maybe just ill conceived? Bacon should be used to wrap things otherwise devoid of flavor. I got the soup of the day - which I would rate just OK...sort of one note. On the positive side - the drinks were great - and the service was excellent. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Went here for a girl's night with some friends. Great location on Selwyn Ave right next to Selwyn Pub. My watermelon martini was delicious although a little pricey. The food options for me were limited since I don't eat meat, dairy or eggs. I ended up with the greek salad minus feta. It was a true greek salad without any lettuce leaves, just cut up peppers, tomatoes, onions and cucumbers. I added a side of the herb couscous which had a good saltiness to it but also had some cinnamon which took me by surprise. The other girls all had meaty meals and the only complaint I heard was my friend who ordered the chivito sandwhich said the steak was a little tough. However she is the daughter of one of the biggest cattle farmers around so she's a little particular when it comes to her steak. I did not partake in dessert (sad face) because again there was nothing for me to choose from, but the ladies happily devoured some devil's food cake, pistachio custard and carrot cheese cake. The only comment I heard was the devil's food cake had a strong coffee flavor. This place worked for a girl's night but I doubt it will make it into my normal restaurant rotation because of the lack of vegan options. ",0,0,1,0,0

 While looking for a place to lease I learned that Desert Realty's staff is very bad-mannered and unfeeling. For in-depth details please read below. After my wife passed away I needed to move my daughter and I to somewhere closer to her school. We found a condo in a nice neighborhood close to the school and contacted Desert Realty to inquire about leasing options. When we walked in we were not greeted for several minutes despite the receptionist sitting at the front desk. When we were greeted it was impersonal and cold. An older man met with us for the initial interview and application process. I mentioned that we needed to move ASAP because of my wife's passing. He could care less and told us that our circumstances would not matter. We had all the forms fill out for their convenience, and when he reviewed them he saw I missed an item and rudely pointed it out. After we were finished he said they would get back to us in a couple of days. We called the same day to check on our status, and the woman who answered the phone said they checked our previous payment history and saw we were late a few times within several years. She pointed out my low credit score, and when I mentioned how credit scores are generally low in this economy, she disagreed and said they could rent out the property to someone with a better credit score. This property has not been leased for over three months. I asked them how they presented our situation to the homeowner and they claimed the homeowner was not interested in leasing to someone like me. I find that hard to believe in an economy like this that a realty company would not suggest leasing to a good tenant with good history. It doesn't seem that Desert Realty is giving an accurate picture to the homeowners they represent. I'm not sure what Desert Realty has against my family and our circumstances but I'm shocked at the level of bluntness and insensitivity that we were treated with. My only advice is to avoid Desert Realty entirely along with their bad attitude and disorderly staff. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I lived across the street from here for 3 years and went about once a week. If you are in the area then give this place a go. There is pretty much always happy hour or reverse happy hour going on so the prices are decent. Their fish is good and drinks are tasty (although on the weaker side). But hey, if you want to get drunk there are always sakebombs. The service is very spotty. The worst service I have ever had has been here (and if that was my first visit I would not have been back) but usually it is average and once in a while it's great. Since I was a regular, I was surprised that none of the servers never once tried to talk to me more than take my order. I have had some of the same servers at least 20 times each, and I am a server so I tip well and would be willing to tip more if they were friendlier. The manager or possibly owner however is nice and always stops by all the tables. If I would have rated Sakebomber when I lived close by the review would have been 4 stars, but the fact that I only moved 10 minutes away and have only been back once means that it nothing to rave about.

 I like the idea of ice cream sandwich store, but not quite sure how it will last during the winter. The cookies were very good, but the ice cream was very sub par.

 I had almost the same bad experience as another reviewer. This used to be a good restaurant but I think it is resting on its past glory. The atmosphere is still great. The surrounding is beautiful. However, the food has gone downhill. My girlfriend and I went there to celebrate her birthday. We ordered the calamari appetizer. It tasted nothing like calamari. It was more like some kind of fish and it was soft, just like fish. The sea bass I ordered was very average. They throw in a few sticks of something to make it look presentable. But, for $30 an entree' I expected something better. Since this is my girlfriend's birthday, I thought they would be decent enough to bring a small piece of cake or dessert to help her celebrate. Guess what? The waiter has the gall to bring 2 teeny pieces of chocolate with a candle on the plate. I almost wanted to throw it back at him. This is an insult, after spending more than $100 on the bill, all they can give you is 2 tiny pieces of chocolate? Even Denny's will give you a free breakfast on your birthday. It shows that this restaurant has no class. Save your money and go to any of the new restaurants with an up and coming chef. Some place where they really want your business. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm a Yard house Veteran, my first visit was to the Costa Mesa California Yard house at Triangle Square. Had my very 1st Cosmo' Martini there many moons ago. After seeing a movie at the AMC Desert Ridge, my mom and I decided to pop in to the Yard House for a bite to eat, the food is usually really good. I ordered the Shitake Mushroom Noodles from the Snack menu and the Spring Rolls from the Hors Devours menu. The spring rolls were crunchy and tasty , my Noodles on the other hand .... I think they'd been sitting under the warming lights too long. They were mildly warm at best and kind of sticky. I was disappointed because I'd had those noodles before and they'd been really good when hot. The server never came back to ask if everything was okay and when he did stop by he hurriedly refilled my water glass and kept it moving , almost as if he was nervous I'd ask him for something, he was obviously very busy. Drinks are expensive. I expect more from the Yard House . ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've been here a few times for beers and to hang out with friends. I decided to be adventurous this past weekend and try the food. Big mistake. I got the nachos, which was nothing more than chips and nacho cheese sauce like you get at a ball game. Runny cheese at that. But on the bright side, my friend got the fish and chips, and they were very good. Although why I thought that there will be good food at a British pub is beyond me... Service has been hit or miss, and this time it was a big hit. A waitress that came around often always checking up on us, which was nice since the place was pretty busy. Plenty of varieties of beer to chose from, mainly your British and Irish varieties, but a few local microbrews thrown in for good measure. The place has a nice crowd, mostly your somewhat funky types thrown in with a mix of your laid back Scottsdale type. There are a few TVs in there (only one big one) showing the game and the alternative X-games stuff you find on Fuel TV. They also have a small pool table crammed in amongst the tables, making it a little tough to play, and a Golden Tee machine. All and all, great place for beers and hanging out, not the best place for a meal. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Water spots on the body, I don't think they even bothered with the windows, and the steaks of armor all on the dash were not very appealing. So the wash sucked. But what sucked more is that someone stole my husband credit card from in between the seats. We went for lunch while they ""washed"" my car and I remembered that I had dropped his card before we had gotten out. My fault for leaving it in there, but you'd think the manager would have cared just a little that someone on his staff stole. Nope. He shrugged it off, ""its not like I can look through their pockets"". I'm not expecting miracles here, but he came off as though this happens all the time and he could not have cared less. While he was looking for the card in the car he didn't even notice the crap job they did. I guess that's just the normal caliber of work they do there. I called and canceled the card right away, spoke with the fraud dept. at the bank today, someone tried to use it at a Blockbuster express, apparently that's what credit card thief's do to see it the card is working. So basically, I would recommend that you avoid them all together. Unless you thoroughly enjoy being ripped off because even if you removed everything that isn't bolted down you still wont get what you paid for. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Went to Osaka's on a Wednesday evening. It was around 9:30 PM, kind of a late dinner so it wasn't too busy. The place was quaint, peaceful and the service was pretty good. I ordered the chicken katsu which wasn't anything out of the ordinary and a beer on top of that. The prices are decent, the staff is friendly. But I was kinda looking for the ""A-Ha"" factor here.. and it never showed up. Overall, good experience, but if you're looking to be blown away.. I'd do a little bit more searching. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Does the trick, they even have tapioca drinks. I'm happy to have a place on the west side where I can grab a quick tapioca tea. Order your food up front and pay, then they either bring it to you or call your order for you to pick up. We tried the Udon soup and the spicy chicken which was great. The red bean tapioco smoothie was really good too. Spring rolls are chinese (fried) style, not the Vietnamese style we were hoping for, but still tasty with some sweet & sour sauce. Had a tough time finding it by the address since google maps is not updated enough to know it's in the Copps shopping center yet.

 I ate at the Sauce in the PHX airport and really liked it so I thought I'd take my 10 YO son to this location for lunch one day. Well, what a disappointment this place was. The service was slow and the staff were all goofing around and not taking care of the customers. When our pizzars arrived I was shocked that they weren't nearly as good as the airport location. There was virtually no cheese on the pizza and they were a little cold when they got there. To aggravate me even more, I ordered a mushroom and peperoni pizza and it had exactly half the amount of peperoni as my sons peperoni only pizza. What the heck - you order 2 toppings and you get half as many toppings of each item but still get to pay extra. Argh!!!! Not going back - ever. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was anticipating going to this restaurant for my friend's bday since she wanted a ""Vegas"" birthday. Well, I'm sad to say that I've had better. First, the amazing: The service from this restaurant was impeccable! The staff was always on hand to bring more bread and fill our water glasses. Second, the food: I love steak. Going to Craftsteak only made sense! I ordered the 16oz Ribeye since the tasting menu wasn't available.. (that was disappointing) If I had to choose a cut of meat, I would say that Ribeye is my absolute favorite.. except I feel like this restaurant was disappointing, especially since this is Tom Colicchio's restaurant. When I got my plate of meat, it was already cut, and a little TOO RESTED where my meat was borderline cold.. a definite first for me. Second, I had some of my friend's diver scallops and I tasted a lot of GRIT/SAND as I was chewing the scallop. It didn't help that it also had a fishy smell/flavor. I'm totally doing this out of order, but I also got the frisee salad.. it was definitely too salty and overpowered by the large clumps of goat cheese. I'm a girl that loves to finish her food, but even I couldn't finish this salad since it was too strong. Dessert - Had the pear/cranberry crumble.. not bad, but not great The best part of my meal would've been the bread which tastes and looks like a King's Hawaiian roll, but with a crispy outside and warm tender inside. YUM.. and I did enjoy the mushroom medley, yukon mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts.. YUMMMY.. Conclusion: I was overall disappointed.. I guess the expectation is, if you're a judge on Top Chef, I would expect the entrees (especially steak if it in the restaurant title) to be much better than the contestants'. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.. and I would much rather go to Stefan's LA Farm.. any day. Sorry Tom.. but I'm still a fan of you as a person! :) ",0,0,1,0,0

 It's okay. Doesn't have food that'll blow you out of the water, but it's not bad grub either. It's your standard diner fare, with sandwiches, pies, cakes, milkshakes, salads, and the works. The one nice thing they do have is the Midnight Breakfast Buffet, which might be worth considering if you're really a fan of eating loads of breakfast food. However, it's not really enough to offset giving it any higher of a rating. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Beautiful Day! The open air patio with a breeze was splendid. It seems to me many chefs are scared to use salt in their cooking. This may be salt shy chef. I rarely add salt to a plate, but it was necessary this time.

 We order here from work quite a bit. They are always friendly and never make you feel rushed when calling in an order. Delivery is always fast and food fresh. I love their garden salad, it's perfect for lunch. The toppings are typical, it's the freshness that makes it stand out. Everything is crispy and bright. I appreciate that because most places I end up throwing away half the salad because it's soggy and wet feeling. I also like the chicken fingers and fries. Regarding the pizza, it's very good. Perhaps the sauce is a skosh bland. But the crust is perfect, chewy where it needs to be, crisp on the bottom. Will definitely continue to give La Bocce my business. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I wish I could give this 3 starts as the service was great (quick and friendly) and the place is neat. I love the idea that they only serve local brews however they should just forget about serving brunch. Went with a group of 6 on a Sunday afternoon and we were the only people in the place. Totally fine but was expecting much more from the menu as they only had 5-6 options to choose from. I went with the omelet of the day which was tomato, arugula and mozzarella. It came with toast (they had no jelly) and a small salad. Everything was just ok and for $10 I left still hungry. Others in my party would not even eat their meal (the shrimp and grits was tasteless and over priced at $12). You know it is bad when half the people leave and head to Dunkin Donuts afterwards. I do hope to go back (probably hard to convince my friends) and try the beer and regular dinner menu. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Generally, this place is decent. My family and I have been coming here for years. Everything is relatively consistent, which we like. The staff is very nice. This may be super biased because, like I said, we've been coming here for years. They recognize us and my mom knows some of them personally. This is literally my moms go-to Thai restaurant whenever she doesn't feel like cooking. The only reason it has 3-stars is because I believe the sanitation is questionable. They're not too big on upkeeping while the restaurant is going. This is not appealing for any guest. Like I said, not bad though. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Korean BBQ in Vegas isn't anywhere close to Korean BBQ in SoCal. For real. But you get what you can get and Tofu Hut is the place to get your Korean BBQ fix for a decent price. During their regular hours AYCE is $16.99, while late night (10 PM - 3 AM) is priced at $13.99. Not too shabby, considering you can get as much meat as you want. They offer a good variety - brisket, bulgogi (marinated beef), thick pork belly slices, tripe, squid, beef tongue and a few others. I'm a fan of the brisket, personally. You can't go wrong with ultra thin slices of beef dipped in their sesame oil/pepper sauce! The marinade on the bulgogi is decent, nothing to rave about. The pork belly is pretty fatty, just a warning. Side dishes are just as important to a Korean BBQ meal as the meat itself. There wasn't a lot of side dishes - kimchi, spicy cucumbers, japchae (stir-fried vermicelli noodles), fishcakes, steamed egg and a pre-dressed salad (essential for any Korean BBQ meal). This may sound like a lot, but really good BBQ places offer a lot more, probably twice as much. I was longing for some bean paste, maybe some garlic and jalapenos. Perhaps I'm asking for too much. After all, you get what you pay for. So why the name 'Tofu Hut' when this place is popular for their Korean BBQ? Before the BBQ times, they once strictly sold a variety of soondubu (soft tofu stew). You can get this from not-so-spicy at all to ultra spicy, all depends on your taste buds. They still have this here and are decently priced. But why spend a near ten bucks on a mediocre soondubu dish if you can pay a few dollars more and eat like a king? ",0,0,1,0,0

 Once a month we are in this area for the past 6 years, and we have never ventured to Hayashi. I was tired of eating Chick-fil-a and needed a change. Well today was the day... This is a really neat setting with the food preparation in from of you, this is only for dinner. For lunch we were directed to the bar area. I am not a sushi person and its seems that they specialize in that. I do however like California Rolls. Unfortunately, the Rolls were not served chilled like I am assuming they should be. They were made fresh, but the items inside were not chilled. Room temp at most. I ordered Shrimp Tempura and they were ok. Everything on my plate was fried. It said I get veggies with my shrimp tempura and I got Veggies in a batter fried. Kinda grease overload. Our service on the other hand was great. He was attentive and took time to explain and questions I had. This is what was stopping the decline to 1 star. I would like to try the Family style dinner with the chef sometime and maybe that will swing my review some. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I bought two vehicles from CarMax and they both have been decent cars. The prices are always fair and customer service for the most part is good. The thing I hate the most is trying to schedule an appointment with service. They usually never answer the phone which is understandable it's a busy place and they are running around. What they really have to work on is returning a phone call. I don't mean returning a phone call within a reasonable amount of time, just returning your call in general. I've called on several occasions to schedule an oil change and have never received a call back. Even after leaving my name, my number, the reason for my call and my vehicle make and model. I hope someone is monitoring this and does something about it. I will be looking to take my vehicle somewhere else for an oil change. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Szmidt's is amazing. The sandwiches are just wonderful. It reminds me of a Katz Deli from NYC. These guys make their cured meats in house.

 On the surface Big Bowl is your typical family owned local Chinese place but it's my favorite. You'll find the standard fast-Chinese-food fare on the menu, plus a lot of extras.

If you can, save yourself time and go in to order, rather than relying on delivery. They're quick either way, but the owners are so happy to see you, it makes your meal taste so much better!

 My family and I had come here before and had superior service and very good food. This last time, we got neither. Our waiter simply didn't like us. There's no other explanation. He ignored our repeated requests for more bread; he never once asked us if we wanted more water (I had to flag down the bus boy whenever he served the adjacent table, which was frequently). He conversed with the customers at the other tables in our area, but didn't even bother to ask us how we were doing. Two other parties arrived after us, yet they received their entrees before we did. Once a large party had entered, he served them, and pawned us off to a bus boy. I had ordered the veal parmigiana. The cheese had not melted; it was still in a clump on top of the meat. It was served lukewarm. We spent close to $90 on our meal. That isn't how you treat people. I wish I would've taken a picture of the pr*ck so that I could say, ""If you see this guy, leave"". But maybe you shouldn't bother; just come back after they fire him. He shouldn't last long. If he does, the place will fold, and you wouldn't have missed much. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I give one star because the only thing I ate that was good was the omelette. I mean you can't mess up a bacon and spinach omelette...can you? Everything else was disgusting, tasteless, bland, flavorless and just down right gross. I only tried this place because it was part of the runner perks for the Rock and Roll marathons, so it wasn't a first choice for buffet. Now I know where to NOT go. The ""waiters"" are not even waiters, they are just busboys. You have to grab your own drink, they don't even bring it for you, including sodas, teas, beer and drinks at the bar, you get yourself. All they do is pick up your plates. So basically its not too much service on their end. It's sad because there alot of food here, but they are all horrible. Pick another place!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 We were having a couple of friends over for some memorial weekend bbq so we wanted to check out the butcher shop for some steaks and charcuterie. We frequent the restaurant often and always wonder what's going on with all the meat displayed in huge refrigerators near the entrance of the restaurant. The butcher (Aaron) was EXTREMELY helpful. He suggested a nice mix of charcuterie based on our adventurousness as well as provided some great tips on how to cook the steak. With our skirt steak, he suggested that the best way to get an even temperature is to flip the steak every minute (vs flipping it once). He also suggested wines and cheeses that would go well with the charcuterie. Even wrote it all down on butcher paper for us! He really knows his stuff! Is it a little on the pricey side? Sure, but not more than Whole Foods. You are getting premium service and products so you def get what you pay for here. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was in the area. I was about to go to Pho Nam but decided to try Chins. My first impression was that this was a lot like Noodles and company with a Chinese decor. It fell short in ambiance and flavor for me. I ordered the Thai Noodles. Thai Noodles: wide Asian noodles with bok choy, red onions, pea pods, and water chestnuts in coconut curry with Thai seasonings, garnished with lime, red pepper, and sprouts. I didn't feel like this had a lot of flavor. It was barely coconut curry and actually had a flavor that was different from anything I have ever had before. The vegetable were fresh and the portion was good. My overall experience was so so but I still ended up having a good time because I was able to witness an exchange between some people that was something like a scene out of the movie Slacker by Linklater. What happened is a person came in and recognized an old classmate. They were friendly and greeted the other person with a hearty, ""Hey! How have you been."" The other person didn't recognize them. He introduced himself and then they knew who he was but they were completely distant and uninterested. It was awkward. A true cringe moment. Some people can be so cold and insensitive.

 Me and a friend were trying to find a new Cuban food restaurant since Havana Cafe's Arcadia location closed in April. My friend found this place to try, which is Puerto Rican food and very similar to Cuban food so we decided to give this place a shot. It's a very unassuming, small counter service place with just 3 tables but we were able to grab a table and order quickly. The menu is small; they had a couple of specials listed, a few types of sandwiches, a variety of sides, desserts, and canned and bottled beverages. A large part of the positive experience was based on the service. They were sooo nice! They asked if we had any questions and explained any dishes we weren't sure of. I wish you could find service like that in other places! As far as the food, I ordered the half steak sandwich, a side of Amarillos (sweet fried plantains, akin to Cuban Maduros), Alcapurrias (banana/yucca mix stuffed with ground beef), and the rellenos papas (a deep fried ball of mashed potatoes stuffed with ground beef). My friend ordered the...and my apologies I don't remember the name...the chicken dish with rice, a pastel (tamale like concoction stuffed with pork), and the tostones (savory plantains smashed down and fried like chips) with garlic sauce. Everything was amaaazing! So good! Just as good as Havana Cafe yet it was very affordable...bonus!! The only downside was they take cash only and the menu is small but all in all I think it was a 5 star worthy place. Unfortunately, I live in the North valley but if I'm on that side of town I'll gladly stop there! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Disclaimer: I work for Intel and we get some pretty good discounts and extra services here through corporate contracts. That said, this place is the perfect spot for a business traveler in the Chandler area. The food is good but even if it isn't up your alley you can walk to one of the many restaurants nearby. Rooms are good but not great. Most importantly, the beds are really good. Way more comfortable than the Marriott beds I've had here. Internet is really fast and reliable, too. Speedtest.net was showing that I was getting around 10mbps down. So pretty good overall. All in all I've had a good experience here. If you're a business traveler it's worth a look.

 Pretty decent. This place is cool for locals and tourist alike if you want a very mellow quiet experience. On a Saturday night it maybe is quarter of the way full. It is kinda out of the way on the second level so that is likely why a lot of people don't go or even know about it. The drinks are nothing special (a five dollar pint of blue moon beer is not special) they have a decent selection of wine and liquors for average price. Their bartenders seem to think they are really busy because they take forever to make drinks and get bills for people. The food on the other hand is really good and very reasonably priced. The crowd is pretty mixed not the loud scene or yardhouse or the uptight people at blue martini. They have a outside area but I have never scene it open, a shame too cause it has serious potential overlooking town square. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We made a return trip to Brando's on the way into Las Vegas en route from California in time for New Year's Eve. Once again, the food that we were served was good, although requests for ""medium rare"" burgers missed the mark at ""medium."" Nevertheless, the burgers were still juicy--much like Five Guys' burgers. Diane had another Bacon Cheeseburger, and this time I ordered a Rocco Burger with Potato Salad. Our server said that she had to check to see if any Potato Salad was available, and asked for me to select an alternative choice just in case. So, I opted for Cole Slaw if no Potato Salad was available. When I returned to my seat after going briefly to the restroom, Diane told me that in my absence the server had reported that neither Potato Salad nor Cole Slaw was available. So, I chose French Fries. And, the thin fries that came with my Rocco Burger were very tasty, as was my hamburger that was topped with Mozzarella, Cheddar Cheese, and sauteed mushrooms, in addition to onions, tomato, and leafy lettuce inside a light and tasty corrugated bun. But the correlation of what is on the menu and what is served at any given time is beyond haphazard. I asked about homemade soup and Chili also listed on the menu, and the waitress said neither was available. When I queried further about how one could tell when certain items would be available for consumption, she at last volunteered that the making of soups, Chili, Potato Salad, and Cole Slaw is entirely up to the whim of the chef on duty at the time. And, she said that if a batch of Potato Salad is made, it usually lasts about three days. But, our server admitted that the availability of these dishes is totally unpredictable at any given time. I would call it ""willy-nilly,"" and don't think this is a good way to run a restaurant. A diner has a right to expect some consistency in what is offered and prepared by a dining establishment--especially for items that appear on the regular written menu, as all the missing offerings here in issue did.

 I absolutely love Paper Tiger! The first time I went in there I was impressed by the soothing music and the quirky stationery. They sell all sorts of giftcards and postcards as well as the funkiest wrapping paper. However, I was especially taken by their notepads with so many beautiful designs at pretty cheap prices. The problem with other stationers is that their products tend to be quite generic but Paper Tiger caters to the secondary school girl in me that wants a unique calendar! As a sidenote, their cookbooks are adorable, and you almost want to eat them! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was very excited when my plans opened up and my family and I were able to go to first friday. My excitement didn't last through the entire night. I went to their website, to try and decipher which lot to park in, how the shuttle worked, and blah blah blah. Navigating down town is difficult as it is. We finally found parking, that was close to the event, they charge $10. Wowza. A lot of the artists......came off rude. A lot of them didn't even say ""hi"" when we walked up to their booth. What a turn off! What would compel me to buy your overpriced ""art"" when you don't even have a decent personality? When you are looking for something to eat, make sure you walk ALL the way through the event. We settled on the ""hummus factory"" truck, because we didn't see the other ones, and were slightly disappointed....There were more promising ones across the street. There was some odd show going on. This chick had flaming batons, and was belly dancing to a slipknot sounding song..... Later, a ""zombie"" came in and it turned into a zombie fire fight. We walked away asking ourselves, ""W T F did we just watch?"" So, okay food, elementary school looking art, and random music playing. Reminds me more of a swap meet than anything else. I don't know if we will be back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Aside from the price, this place is pretty good. Nothing super spectacular. But good none the less. Me and my younger brother decided to grab a couple drinks and food before catching the 9 o clock LOVE showing. Since he owed me dinner. I figured we would come here. Plus ive always wanted to try this place. We ordered a couple of sushi pieces. Along with the rock. Hmmm and a couple of rolls. Not to mention a few kirins. Sushi was pretty fresh, was good. Rolls were extreamly small. A little disappointed to say the least. The rock was probably the highlight of the meal. Very very good. But once again very small pieces of beef come with it. And for 17 bucks. It's a bit much. We caught happy hour though. Which wasn't a total loss. Our waitress was so so. She could of been a bit more attentive. Atmosphere and decor set the mood right. We sat in the lounge area. Which was pretty cool. I don't mind forking up cash for a good meal. This place has all the right tools. But they don't use them properly. In other words. Bigger portions wouldn't make the place bankrupt. In fact I wouldn't mind coming back. But there's always those doubts where maybe I might choose elsewhere. And thats where this place needs to pick up the slack. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Kidney Puncher has a wide selection of Mods, clones, and parts but falls short in customer service. I've bought a few clones from them and was pleased at the selection and the online inventory showing what they had in stock. Most recently I bought a mech mod and headed home. I tried to adjust the bottom button because it was crunchy and would not screw in far enough. It turns out that one of the tubes was made too short and the manufacturer was going to issue replacements. It is difficult if not impossible to track down the contact info for the Chinese company I reached out to KP for support 14 days ago but they've since blown me off and wont respond to my inquiries. I'm now stuck with a $70 paper weight. If you need something quick Kidney Puncher will probably have what you need. Just don't count on customer service. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I had heard of the bagel cafe from my wife's sister when she came and helped us move. She had said she definitely recommended it. So since it was my mother's birthday and my wife and I wanted to take her out for a morning breakfast we decided to try the bagel cafe. When we arrived we definitely noticed that the parking spots were for compact vehicles, since there was someone who didn't get that message and had their 1 ton truck taking up 2 parking spots. After finding a parking spot we walked in and were quickly greeted and found a spot to sit. It was my first time to this location so I was not sure if this was like a sandwich shop a pastry shop or a restaurant, well apparently it's all in ONE which is quite awesome I love one stop shops. After being seated we sat and waited at the table for menus. The bus boy came and asked if we wanted drinks. We ordered 1 coffee and 2 waters and again we waited. The waitress came with a pen and pad and asked us if we were ready to order. We all said we were waiting for the menus. She quickly apologized and informed us that the menus were located at the end of the table and was newspaper like menus. We looked through the menu which seemed a bit long for a breakfast/lunch establishment I believe that even in the last pages there were dinner plates which confused me a bit as there not open past 5. We ordered a cup of Matzo Ball soup, a biscuits and gravy plate, a corn beef hash and egg plate and one fresh veggie omelet. The matzo ball soup came with one ignoramus matzo ball and it was piled high with vegetables and chicken. My mom being the very whitey person that she is quickly reminded me how she had made me a similar soup when I was a kid and how I complained to her that what she served me was clearly not matzo ball soup and it was chicken noodle soup with a matzo ball in it LOL! Well that's exactly what I got here. My mom is a sous-chef at petrossian bar at the Bellagio and she drilled me at how matzo ball soup can be made in many different ways. Well I don't prefer this kind all though it was hearty and the matzo ball was delightful. I still prefer a matzo ball soup with just matzo ball not with chicken and vegetables. The portions reminded me allot of hash house a go go. The portions were rather big and hearty. The biscuits were soft and the gravy was very exquisite a change from hash house because there biscuits seemed to be a bit hard and these were really soft and awesome when paired with the gravy. The veggie omelet was a veggie omelet nothing spectacular. The corn beef hash was tasty especially coming from me because I'm not a corn beef fan and this one was defiantly cooked correctly and seasoned just right. I think the customer service was sub-par. I could tell that the waitress was definitely trying to be nice and helpful however I felt at times I was forgotten we only had 1 water refilled and my mother's coffee was never refilled or even offered to be refilled. We might possibly try them again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Adjacent to Luby's, and the clientele isn't any younger. Location overlooks two petite man made lakes, one fo the west and one to the south. Bar has a pure sports bar feel, with flat panel TV's and loads of Miller Lite logoed Nascar cardboard cut outs. Beer on draft is more American sports bar too, from memory: Bud Light, Miller Lite, Anheusier Busch Amber Bock, and then two lonely German taps of Paulaner Munich Lager & Oktoberfest. Very short/limited menu, and rather average tasting food. Seems to be a local bar for retired folks since everyone seemed to know everyone's name as they entered the bar, and the bartender served each of their differing drinks without having to ask them what they wanted. I know it says ""New German Cuisine"" but I was hoping for a more German feel overall, rather than what looks like any other Nascar decorated, MIller Lite serving sports bar (that happens to serve a limited menu of German food).

 This is not really fair because it was a very long time ago and at their old location but I once ordered soup and they brought it out by the cash register before I paid. When she handed me my change, a nickel literally fell in my soup. I was shocked to hear her tell me it will be okay and to just go ahead and fish it out. She made no move to take back the soup with the nickel in it that SHE dropped. I was so shocked and I thought wow if that is what they do in front of the customer, what goes on behind the customers view. I had to insist that she take it back but I think I switched to a different soup so she could not reserve it to me. I never went back and I did call and complain. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I went because several people I know raved about the place, because I'm a lapsed vegetarian and I'm always trying to get back on track and heard the veggie sandwiches were incredible, and because I'm a malt freak and found out they have malteds there. I was disappointed. And my friend I was with who had been one of Stickler's die-hard fans said that, although it was okay this time, the place seems to have gone down hill. Stickler's wasn't busy at all, maybe 4 tables of customers and 3 people in line, but although there were alot of workers behind the counter, the service was very slow. We had to wait a long time for our veggie sandwiches. Now my friend has been there when it was jam-packed and she said the service then was much quicker. We went about 2 so maybe the staff was worn out from the lunch rush earlier. The bread was good, crunchy on the outside and soft inside but the vegetarian sandwich itself was boring. It's supposed to have Swiss, Provolone and American cheese on it. I couldn't even taste the Swiss or Provolone at all, the American over powered the sandwich and was more like a cheez-whiz type. I'm always on the look out for a good malt, one that really tastes like a malt and not a shake. My chocolate malt tasted more like a shake and I wasn't impressed with the ice cream. My buddy liked her vanilla malt though. The one thing I did like about Stickler's is that they have the small bags of Miss Vickie's chips to buy. It used to be you could buy big bags in the grocery stores but now the chips,which are the best kettle chips I've ever had, are just carried in certain deli and sandwich shops. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Boooo!! I was not impressed with this overpriced seafood buffet. I was hesitant to pay almost $50 per person, but I told myself that if I ate 4 plates of food, I would get my money worth. There just wasn't enough of a variety for ME to want to eat 4 full plates worth of anything. I went specifically for the crab legs and was turned off when the crab legs were frozen with ice, literally. And had zero taste. I then proceeded to get the hot, crab legs and they were flavored with something that tasted like terriyaki, but I would like to think that they would know better than to mess up crab legs with some terriyaki sauce. So I will assume it was some unknown seasoning that was used. Nonetheless, I didn't like it! Yucko! Plate number three was dessert. The most interesting thing for dessert was the gelato. Which I discovered, I hate gelato!! All the other desserts weren't appealing to the eye so I stuck with a sugar cookie. Boring, I know. My fourth plate was full of random food that didn't even fill me. Save your money! Note, you will think that the buffet doesn't have signs for the dishes, but you have to look up on top of the display and you will see the names projecting from a limb. This piece of information will make you a rockstar when the guy behind you says ""I wish I knew what this dish was called"". Thank me later!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was in the neighborhood for work and was starving and needed a place to eat at 10 am (most lunch establishments around here open at 11 am) so Yelp and the helpful filters led me here. The establishment is catered to the locals and has an old school feel in a good way. Our server was very nice and helpful. My co-worker was in the mood for bruschetta which was not on the menu, but the chef made one for us anyway. It was delicious with fresh tomatoes and a nice blend of acidity and sweetness. I tried the fazoletti which was pretty good. I never had it before, but it was described to me as a deconstructed lasagna, which I really like. The dish was solid, and the portions were generous. Overall it was a decent local place and good value. ",0,0,1,0,0

 My wife and I sit down to what we hoped would be a great Italian meal. We waited for about 10 minutes for the waiter to take our drink order. We got our bread before seeing our waiter. When he finally showed up to ask our drinks, we were ready to place our order. I ordered a caprese salad, and my wife ordered pennoni alla vodka. The food was quick to come, but sadly not worth our wait to sit. Her small portion of pennoni had only two miniature chunks of bacon. My mozzarella on my caprese basically disintegrated in my mouth and turned to mush. All in all we didn't enjoy our time and were both disappointed. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Meh. I had to ask for water twice. The second time was when my meal came, and I was still left drinkless. I waited and waited some more, staring at my plate, and finally was given not one, but two glasses of water; as if two late should make up for one on time. My Ruben was terribly dry. I drenched it with a full mini bottle of dijon, but even that didn't help much. A pickle would have been nice too. For $15, I'd hope to get something that was at least half way decent. I must say I was a bit disappointed, even for cafe standards. My only tips in coming here would be to keep your expectations low, and don't forget to redeem your Player's Card comp dollars to pay for part or all of your bill. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Ahh BJ's... 6 months ago you were one of my favorites in the East Valley. Now, not so much. In fact, I may never go back. Always enjoyed the atmosphere which has not changed, usually the wait staff is competant, but the food was always great. Good portions and quality ingredients, but not anymore. Server was very mechanical and short. Since others bring the food, what else dies she have to do except check on us and keep our drinks filled? Sad. We ordered the Italian Market Salad which we usually split. It used to be a very finely chopped mountain of lettuce with great veggies, Garbanzo beans, cheese, meat etc. Now it has a small handful of white, droopy iceberg lettuce, tons of dressing and lots of white cheese balls. I could not finish my half (I was starving buy it was too gross) so we quickly paid and left. At this point even Taco Bell or Chipotle sounded good! So sad.. ",1,0,0,0,0

 So we double dated at Bachi Burger and the first thing we notice is that smell! It smelled so good! Like my intro? The 4 of us were all Bachi virgins and our cherries were about to get popped like goes the weasel! All of us agreed to get a different burger each and a different specialty drink. I ordered the Kalbi Burger which I thought was the biggity bomb! It had kim-chee inside! It came with a side of Kim-chee style mini zucchini/cucumber, wasn't too sure what it was but it was tasty, and went well with my burger. The drink i had was the strawberry lemonade jasmine tea (no free refills). It was really pulpy so if you order it, make sure you get a glass of water too to wash it all down. And I can't forget the ox-tail chili cheese fries... Mmm! I just wish they put more ox-tail. The overall experience at Bachi was a memorable one.

 I am actually surprised that this place has gotten so many four and five star reviews. This was okay for on-the-go sushi, but I felt that for the quality it was overpriced. I would much rather have great than sub-par sushi. We went on a Friday night and ordered a Philly roll, the 3 Alarm roll, and a custom roll, plus a serving of edamame. For all the rolls, they use pre-shaped rice sheets that are a bit dry and chewy. This just made eating the sushi pieces more of a workout for the mouth than it probably should be. The Philly roll was alright; it was made with salmon, cream cheese, cucumber, and, surprisingly, avocado. This was actually the best tasting out of the three rolls we bought, even though there was nothing special about it. My boyfriend ate the 3 Alarm roll and said he was disappointed with lack of spice in a supposedly spicy roll. I'm not sure I would try this place again since we could easily get better quality sushi at cheaper prices during happy hour elsewhere. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Morton's The Steakhouse was one of my favorite restaurants. I have spent about $2500 at Morton's in six months. The first two visits were perfect. Unfortunately our last visit was a serious disappointment. The food was good, but the service was poor. Our table was too small for seven people and was right outside of the kitchen, but the real bad-apple was the server. She was inattentive, slow and error-prone. She didn't even bring out the dessert cart, and it was my Mom's 93rd birthday. I filled out the survey and scored it appropriately. The manager later called and seemed a little lackadaisical. I told him the story; he promised to send a gift card. I just received a gift card for $25. That's right... $25, after spending $2500! The gift card came from Sr. Vice President of Operations, Tim Whitlock. I really can't think of a better slap-in-the-face than a $25 gift card, after spending $2500. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Italian Restaurant is officially one of my favorite restaurants in town. After our third wonderful visit last night, it's become our ""go to"" when we want a great meal, great ambiance, at a really reasonable price. Each time we've gone, we've tried something new on the menu, and each one is better than the next. The pasta with lamb was out of this world, but most likely you won't see it again, as Chris changes the menu regularly, depending on what's in season, and the most fresh. However, if you get a chance, try one of their mainstays, the meatballs, whether in the sandwich, or alone with the most delicious marinara sauce and some of his out of this world bread. In fact, it was so good, we bought an extra order to bring home with us, and I ate it for breakfast this morning! We usually get a table, but last night we elected to sit at the bar, and were so happy we did. Mike and Lisa made the experience that much better, by making us feel welcome, like we were sharing a meal with friends. Oh, and if you like Mojitos, the house Mojito is insanely good. Only trouble is, so good, they go down really quickly! If you've been thinking about going, GO!!! Do NOT wait! Bravo Chris Bianco. You've done it again! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I'll keep this short and straight to the point. I'm so dissapointed. I came in with a group of friends during the weekend. I asked for a basic mani-pedi. Payed 40$. The lady I had wasn't the most pleasent. While finishing my to coat she accidentally bumped a nail and instead of taking the polish off that finger and redoing it, she just put another topcoat over trying to cover it up. It was a glob of clear uneven nail polish on one finger... Clearly this isn't going to end well. I sat and let them all dry for over thirty min. As soon as I got in my car that nail was ruined, so I went back inside and had them fix it while they talked about me in Korean. All in all it was not worth it. My mani (even after they fixed the bad nail) only lasted one full day. My pedicure didn't even last a week. For a pedicure not to last at least a week is absurd in my opinion. I won't be back.

 My husband and I went there recently. We are new to the area, so we looked up reviews re: this place. People had great things to say. Unfournately, our dining experience was awful. First, the Seaford Specialties were not so special. I had the broiled jumbo shrimp platter with red potatoes. The shrimp was not jumbo (stringy) and the red potatoes were boiled brown idaho. My husband had the surf and turf. Steak was leathry and fried shrimp were out of a frozen box. Also, his side dish was to be rice pilaf. This was not the case. It was some sort of microwavable rice. All of the items on our dishes tasted like forzen cheap food. The place looks great. Food garbage. We did not send anything back. Due to the fact I do not trust any employee.

 Gotta big up local DJ Maybelline for puttin' me up on this dope Rockabilly steeze barbershop that I drive clear across town for. I've been through my fair share of barbers locally not to mention in my lifetime and these cats are among the coolest, most on point dudes to get your hair done did. So while I may work in a kitchen, I have a great deal of respect for these dudes who like me are on their feet for 7+ hours all day, working with real sharp devices all while trash talking/carrying a conversation. Have you ever been to a barber (or salon) and you were just in and out thinking to yourself: ""damn that was fast"" or, ""done already?"" Well that's not the case with these dudes. They don't rush in other words, THEY TAKE THEIR TIME. Who the fu*k really does that nowadays? They do. No crazy designs. No half azz cuts. No BS. Just straight up nice tapers fades or probably whatever you want for that matter. I simply wish they had a location closer to me in the Southeast. PBRs are back so you can sip and get a little morning head change while waiting on one of the barbers if last nite drunken revelry wasn't enough to do you in. Straight razor finish always makes you feel like a million bucks and always makes my fu*kin' day. As of about a month ago (7.20.13) they added another barber so things can run more smoothly and you aren't waiting 2-4 hours to get chopped.. Well I'm lyin'.. depending on who you want to do you up the wait still might be 2-4 hrs. I almost dread giving this spot 5 stars on the count of creating more traffic and waiting over 4 hours *gasp*! I kid. Bottomline, these cats deserve all the men's cuts that there is to offer in Vegas. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I would have given it 3 stars. While their selection isn't huge, its offerings were enough since I was starving and would have eaten anything. The sushi was surprisingly fresh and decent. The stir fry veggies and noddles were tasty. Their American bbq section...the tri-tip= not so great, okay mac&cheese, weak greens and decent yams. Yummy salad bar, but they prepare it for you. And the dessert bar? My favorite part of the meal. They had a great selection of mini desserts. The creme brulee, fruit tart, chocolate covered strawberries and banana donuts were all yummy. Although some of my food didn't taste that great- it wasn't horrible, I was fine there leaving with a full stomach. But not even a couple hours laters, my tummy started hurting and I was hoping it'd go away as we had got to our seats for the Love show. Sadly, my stomach got worse and I had no other choice than to go poop in a public bathroom. I NEVER go #2 in a public bano! That's just not cool. But my stomach was killing me and thankfully, I was able to relieve myself with plenty of time before the show started. Because of my bad tummy ache, and not being able to pinpoint what brought it on, I will say that visiting The Buffet at TI in the future will not be on my list. :( ",0,1,0,0,0

 My favorite place in Madison. It's a good departure from the standard Wisconsin fare of burgers and cheese curds. I have been here about three times and have tried the moules et frites, duck breast, and the whole fish (it's seasonal, I think). Moules are standard (i.e., good) and frites are thin-cut and great. The duck breast has a citrus flavor and comes in a delicious sauce. There is also a large beer selection. Service is friendly and prompt. Prices are very reasonable. Portions are relatively generous. Weekend nights are crowded, but never more than a half hour to forty-five minute wait for me. The ambience is good for both couples and small groups. ",0,0,0,1,0

 After hearing wonderful reviews about their lunch special from BFF and yelper Amelinda L., the opportunity to dine there came up recently with her and Sharon L. Their lunch menu, which is priced beautifully at $22.14, features a tasting of seafood that allows you to close your eyes and really visit the mediterranean, even if it's just for a couple hours. APPETIZER: For a starter, it was HIGHLY recommended to get the Grilled Octopus, which is composed of sashimi grade imported Mediterranean octopus, which has been charcoil broiled with what appears to be an amazing, fruity, olive oil. This dish DOES have a $10 supplement. Dishes with supplements are a tossup for me. Sometimes it's a win, while others can be a joke. This one is the former - WELL worth it. Amelinda L. joked that she could eat a whole plate of it and although I believed her, after I tried it, I began echoing her sentiment. Truly delicious. I think that what made it so delicious was really the quality of the seafood, and the preparation just made it shine. THE MAIN: My main course choice was also recommended to me - the Shrimp Saganaki with tomato and feta cous cous. The flavoring of the Shrimp was so flavorful and perfectly cooked, allowing for the tenderness of the protein to really compliment the flavors. The cous cous was simply bursting with that earthy, rustic flavor with the feta and tomato, and was an amazing compliment. I just wished there were more of it! DESSERT: Lastly, I had The Real Greek Yogurt for the dessert. If you love true Greek yogurt - the thickly textured stuff, that's tart and makes your mouth pucker a bit -- then this is for you. A lot of people enjoy Fage and Oikos greek yogurt, but that's on the sweeter side. This is a little more tart but I love it. My recommendation for you if you prefer something on the sweeter side is to get the fresh fruit plate, which Amelinda L. got. It contained a really fresh mix of fruit that was beautifully prepared (with the exception of what looked like a peeled Cutie - just seemed like there could have been a little more effort there - ha!). Sharon L. got the greek yogurt like me and she found it too tart. DRINK: I ordered a jasmine tea, which was strong and allowed for two brews, which they kindly accomodated. The service was top notch, and the environment simply amazing. There's a display of fresh fish on ice towards the kitchen, which was semi-open (but not loud at all) and the view from the windows were lovely. I'd recommend this as a great choice for locals and visitors alike. The quality of the food for the price is superb. There's an Estiatorio Milos in New York, which I hope to try soon. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Food is good although they are always trying to rush me through and keep trying to wrap up my burrito before I'm done adding stuff. It's like they don't want me to see everything I can add to my burrito. Also last time I put lettuce in my burrito so they would not give me any on the side ... Wtf ? I would strongly advise them on getting a salsa bar, that would be a deal breaker for me. I will not be returning unless it's heavily discounted or they add a salsa bar. Over all food is decent although every time I go there somehow they piss me off which is rare for a restaurant to do. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'll give it a 2 1/2 stars. Just really average. I like to play at local casinos much more than The Strip counterparts, mainly because well, it's easier. And closer to home. So I get monthly offers all the time for BOGO on the buffets at Station Casinos, and discounts to restaurants in places like Suncoast. Well, this one came as a coupon in the mail. It was kinda hard to pass up. Why? Because it was so cheap! You know me...cheap + eats = count me in. I know, time and time again it's a lesson I need to learn from. Cheap doesn't always = yummy. But hear me out. The Caf \ u00e9 Siena in the Suncoast Hotel & Casino sent a coupon for last January to have dinner of prime rib, and Cajun shrimp pasta. Choice of starch included, fresh vegetables, soup or salad, AND a slice of pie for dessert. All for a whopping $5.99! Yes! And the coupon was good for up to TWO people! I instantly told the wifey where we were eating on Friday night date night. She was...less than stoked. I had to tell her it was 'my treat'. LOL I've been to Caf \ u00e9 Siena before but mainly for their late night eats. Cheapness abounds. Not to mention, you know they have a decent Chinese menu? Very strange, but somehow works. ""What do we want today...a Reuben sandwich...or some Mongolian Beef?"" This of course makes the cafe's menu all over the place. American stuff in the front...BAM! Asian stuff in the back. Hmmm...sorry, made it sound like a sleazy brothel there for a second. This time around we skipped the menu, went in with our order beforehand. For appetizers, some fried chicken wings. For dinner...BAM! Coupon on the table. Order for two. You been served, sucka! Of course the waiter was like, ""Ah yes, our monthly coupon. Lovely."" Not sure if he was being nice, or being sarcastic (I rule a bit of both). Asked us how we like our prime rib (medium rurrrr for me), if we wanted soup or salad (salad with ranch on the side for me), and what kind of starch (baked potato for me). After 15 minutes or so, our chicken wings came out accompanied with celery and carrot sticks. With sides of hot sauce and ranch. Was actually pretty impressed. For $7 we got 10 or so good sized wings. No skinny chicken! They actually tasted good too, not greasy, and very crisp. Luckily they were on a new batch of oil. No bad aftertaste. We almost finished these off. A few minutes later our salads came out. Nothing fancy - a small plate of iceberg lettuce with some romaine mixed in, shredded carrots, red onion, a few slices of cucumber, a cherry tomato or two, topped with croutons. Nothing special of note, but at least none of my lettuce was wilted. We also got some rolls with this and gratefully they were still warm. Soon after our entrees came out. I almost let out a little chuckle. How in the world does prime rib match up with shrimp fettuccini? It is a funny little combo. Anyway, there it was, sitting on my plate. With my baked potato and a side of steamed green beans. Presentation? Bland. I like colorful food and the most colorful thing on my plate were the green beans. Taste? Not the best meal in the world, but it sure beats a frozen turkey dinner. The baked potato was steaming, although it's hard to mess a potato up. Prime rib was OK for me, not chewy and actually tender. Cooked medium rare just like I asked. Nothing spectacular. The Cajun shrimp past just didn't work for me. It was just to heavy to go along with the already fatty prime rib. The heavy cream sauce just left me a bit uneasy. But it didn't taste bad. It was just too rich. The shrimp were good though, not a rubbery mess. We were pretty full after our entrees. Our waiter saw that and asked if we would like our slice of pie to go. Nice touch from him. I got a slice of chocolate cream pie, and the wifey got a slice of coconut cream pie. These looked like the same pies they serve in their buffet. Overall everything was OK. Nothing over the top outstanding. Service was quick and friendly. Place always seems to be busy, especially later at night. Best of all, the entire meal was cheap! Spent just over $20 for appetizer, entrees, tax and tip. Got to go home with leftovers and pie as well! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Used to be a four star place before the portion sizes went down and they removed the shrimp. No shrimp at all?!?!? That was my favorite part. The owner said their prices went up so they removed it. I understand business but at the same time keeping customers happy and customer retention is important as well. I will find a new place to go when I crave Mongolian BBQ. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Six months is a long time to go between eating at the great Portillo's here, but I made it back for lunch today, again joined by Yelper friends Mark R. and Robyn N. This time I ordered a dipped Italian Beef (sandwich on a French Roll), some crispy Onion Rings and a bowl of Chili with complimentary cheese and onions. Prices are up just a bit from my last visit, but the staff members were still friendly, all the food was terrific and the waits to order and be called not long at around 11 AM, now that this place has been here for a little while and the crazy zillions of customers crowding in has abated some. (Today you could actually park your car, get a table, and talk to your friends without having to yell!) * Italian Beef: $5.49 * Onion Rings: $2.19 * Bowl of Chili: $3.10 Yay for the new, mellower Portillo's where it's still a straight 5 Stars! :-)) ",0,0,0,0,1

 Checking out the other reviewers makes me think I am missing something. Twice, I've tried the salmon salad and am not keen about it. Is it simply smoked salad with ranch dressing?

 ""Hey, Kerstin! Why are you eating a grilled cheese for dinner? Didn't you just eat out?"" ""Yeah, but we ate at Miracle Mile."" 'Nuf said, really, but our experience was such an epic fail, I must elaborate a bit. This was Hubby's suggestion, mind you, and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options. After a lunch of Peter Piper, however, even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him. We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later, since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue. He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish. This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust. What he got was an overly peppered dried out, square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste, crunch, or flake to it. It had that speckled look that old pastry gets. If this is what a knish is supposed to be, then they nailed it. I got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread. What is this? 1950? At least it wasn't Wonder Bread. It was wheat. I had asked for sour dough, when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially. There were. The manager ""saved"" me by correcting his employee about the caraway, only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register. ""Why don't you like caraway?"" she asked. I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied, ""I really don't like the taste."" When she asked me ""Why?"" a second time, you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting this establishment. Anyway, the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the ""sauce"" was totally canned, and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese. It was also not to temp. The mashed potatoes were 75% instant with some red skins thrown in for that ""real"" texture. Foul, foul, foul. Hence, the grilled cheese. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Parking (2/5): Parking is a big hastle. Unless if you get to the stadium three or four hours before the games starts, then you will find the parking easily. $15/per car (cash only), I am not sure if the rates are different for big trucks. I went there for a USC vs Frezno; and because it was a big games. I think they did do a good job directing traffic to the park lot. Ambiance (N/A): I have this category for restaurants, so it doesn't really apply to a stadium. In short, all I can say that ambiance was loud enough for a place full of drunk-passionate USC fans. Service (2/5): There was a lot of hired help, bathrooms were clean enough and the concessions lines moves as a fast enough pace. However, some areas definitely needed more cleaning, i.e. there were trash cans that were overflowing and some toilets in the men room were doing same, except it was more disgusting. Food and beer are very expensive, which should be no surprise to anyone. A bottle of Bud cost $7 and $6 hot dogs were subpar. Overall (2/5), it's a mediocre place for to rob die-hard fans. The stadium itself is very small, but the positive of that is that you feel like you are sitting very close to the actual field. I probably wouldn't have gone there if it wasn't a free ticket ($55) through a consulting company's generosity. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Let's start by saying I nor the other person in my party eat pork. We spent 5 minutes talking with the waitress how pork does not belong in a lobster roll and ordered a lobster roll with NO bacon. The lobster roll came out with bacon. We told the waitress and she took away the roll and the manager came over. They did not bring us a new roll but instead gave us a free milkshake (which we didn't even want) the bill came and we mentioned something about taking the roll off since it was made incorrectly and we were never brought a new one. They wouldn't take it off the bill because they gave us a milkshake that we didn't even want. I can't believe Mario and Bastianich put their name on this place. Obviously it's just so they can make money. They definitely wouldn't eat the slop served here. The cod sandwich was flavor less and soggy. I wish we would have ate at Mcdonalds (no joke) ",1,0,0,0,0

 I had a feeling before stepping foot (how about that for a quick pun!) into this store that the prices were going to drive me away. I was also expecting a lot more footwear options. I was correct on the price, wrong on the selection. The wall of shoes is very lacking. I have a big and wide foot with a fairly shitty flat arch so I constantly have trouble finding a shoe that: A) fits, and B) looks decent. This store had a handful of shoes that were in the 4E width I need, but not many in a style/color scheme that didn't look like it was designed by a hardcore raver in the peak of his acid trip. The man running the store was very friendly at first, but quickly pissed me off because without even looking at my foot he said the foot size I told him I had wasn't true. Guy, I've had my foot for a long time, I'm pretty sure I know my size. But whatever...he measures it and surprise surprise, my foot is the size I said it is. So he starts showing me the few models in stock that will fit, none of which really float my boat. He then proceeds to tell me I need to wear a size smaller so my toes smash and strain against the toe of the shoe. Yea, no. I'm going to be doing a lot of running and working out in these shoes and I don't need any sort of discomfort. I'd rather buy slightly bigger than slightly smaller. I was never explained the reasoning, but he tried polishing it as a Mr. Wizard statement, thou I took it as an answer from Dr. Stupid (I really miss Ren & Stimpy). I try on the shoes...and look, I haven't worked many retail jobs in my life, but I know better than to talk about religion or politics with a potential customer. This guy didn't get that memo. While I'm walking around he starts talking about Obama and Gingrich and that other guy with the million dollar haircut. Another thing I hate is forced sales practices. The shoes felt good in the width and arch, not in the length since he's cramming my foot into this too small shoe. I ask him about a larger size but he says no. OK. Then he proceeds to say ""So do you want to wear them out? And will it be cash or charge?"" Slow your role guy, who said shit about me buying these...you won't even bring out the size I requested or need. Just out of curiosity I ask how much there are. Without batting an eye he quotes $139. $139?!?! It's a mid-tier New Balance running shoe, what are you high, I'm not paying that! I pull out my phone and look them up online and I find the same model shoe, in a better color actually, on Amazon and Zappos for $76. That's almost half the price. So I pry the shoes off and hand them back to him and tell him thanks for his time. He still forces the sale, I tell him no thanks, he gets pissy and says fine, the shoes you have will destroy your feet. You'd think for as much as he overprices these shoes he'd be able to afford the non-sour grapes. ",1,0,0,0,0

 They definitely need to work on their customer service. We came here Friday night & awkwardly stood there for about 3min before someone said can I help you. (Note there was about 5 employees present) We proceeded to place our order w/ a hispanic chubby girl who obviously had a stick up her ass. Then we got our Pizza & wings & she had the nerve to say ""have a good night."" Uhhh...we were eating in. We had to ask for our own plates. No one ever asked if we were doing okay, even though we needed forks for our boneless wings. We ate a bit & were super annoyed so we left. The pizza was nothing to rave about. I'd compare it to Little Cesars but more greasy & thinner. Their boneless wings were blah. I will not be coming back or recommending this place to anyone.

 Yes, I am a fan. It is similar to ""Fresh choice"" in California, but I like the variety and freshness of the dishes. The salad bar is the same, so I won't go into to much detail about that. We like to go on Sundays after church for lunch. What I do like is there soup bar, 5 to 6 different types of soups are very delicious ranging from (chicken noodle, clam chowder, Irish potato lech, spicy chili bean, minestrone lentil), Fresh baked goods are refreshed every hour. Corn bread, blueberry muffins, pizza, french rolls. They have a stir fry section, which changes daily depending on breakfast lunch or dinner. I personally like the cheesy macaroni. They have Baked potatoes with all the fixing's. The usual dessert par includes: fresh fruit, jello, pudding, chocolate/ vanilla soft server. bonus; on occasion a server will come by with fresh baked chocolate chip cookies. One thing I noticed though, is even though this place is suppose to be healthy. All you can eat doesn't help from gorging myself. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Tender is located inside the Luxor Hotel, Ate here because I was fiending for a nice piece of steak, and heard they they have fresh seafood and meat flown in daily. Can't complain about the service because our waiter was awesome. The head chef also made his way to our table making sure we were well taken care of, and asking us how are food was. The decor was elegant and classy red walls, dim lighting good ambiance. Started off with the wild mushroom soup, damn i really wish they gave me a bigger portion of this soup because it was absopositively delicisous. Never had anything like it. I ordered their prime rib, but to tell you the truth it was whatevs, I was more into the wild mushroom soup then the prime rib lol. Although the prime rib was a really nice cut, I couldnte even finish it all. Overall great restaraunt out of the many restaraunts in vegas. Pricey, but they have prix fixe menu's for that.

 Bottom line on this recent visit: the crabs are great; the service.....not so much. We were served by a waiter named Kyle. After he brought us our drinks, he then took our order of 8 blue crabs (Tuesday's special at $2/crab) and an order of black mussels. We waited for about 10 minutes until the crabs arrived, however there was no sign of the black mussels nor did Kyle tell us that the mussels would be coming up shortly. That's fine we thought. We figured the mussels would arrive soon. 15 minutes into our enjoyment of the crabs, we realized that our order of mussels had yet to arrive. Ok, we'll just ask Kyle about the order of mussels when he checks up on us or when he returns to refill our drinks. Turns out that would never happen. Not once did Kyle check up on us or refill our drinks until well afterward as we were finishing up our meal. One of the other servers (his name was David, I believe, and he appeared to be a senior member of the staff) took it upon himself to refill our drinks and ask us if we needed more crabs. If it weren't for David, we would still be waiting there to have our drinks refilled and our second order of crabs taken. Prior and after David approaching us, we would notice Kyle walk by and glance at our table several times during our meal. Not once did he ask us if the meal was to our liking nor did he refill our drinks. It seems that he didn't notice our drinks (or lack there of) or that he just couldn't be bothered to refill them. We were not about to ask to have our drinks refilled nor ask about our missing order of mussels because we as paying customers feel that we SHOULD NOT HAVE TO. The server should be looking after the customer frequently and making sure that every need is met without having to be flagged down or asked. Only at the very end of our meal did Kyle finally approach us and ask us if we needed anything else. By that point I didn't even mention the order of mussels that we never received and just asked for refills of our water. I would only mention the missing order of mussels if they showed up on our bill (it did not, which is another issue entirely). We've been here several times before and have usually had good service. This was not one of those times. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Meh. That sums up my opinion of Nu Sanctuary. I've mistakenly given it many chances over the last year since their grand opening, and each time has been essentially the same experience. Exhibit A: Excited to try the new venture of it's managers formerly of Almaza - my favorite place to get drunk back in the day when I was underage and rebellious - I came to Nu with a couple friends. After being seated, we waited *twenty five* minutes without being greeted by our server before finally flagging down the manager and saying, ""Hey, WTF man?"". Although a server came by after that, the service left a lot to be desired as our server preferred to sit with a table in our view a couple spots away, flirting with the male patrons rather than check on us or see if we wanted to order anything more. The meal was mediocre, it took forever to get our drinks, and the service left me not only disappointed but actually a little upset. Exhibit B: This time the service was a little bit better, although still very sub-par when compared not only to other hookah spots and lounges, but other bars in the same area of Town Square. She actually checked on us - once every twenty minutes, maybe. However what this review is really about is the quality of their hookah - they had raised prices since the last time I'd visited, and anywhere in Vegas charging $30 for a head of hookah that only lasts 15 minutes before getting tasteless and harsh, can suck it. Apparently their prices are now $20 for a head and $10 for refills, which is moderate, but unless they've changed the hookah I've never had it last long enough to be worth the $. From my experience, it's either love or hate. I've never met anyone to say that Nu was ""okay"" - but have certainly heard my sentiments echoed by many of my friends after their own terrible experiences (one friend, after making reservations a week in advance, was forced to wait 45 minutes for a table. Wtf.) - as well as a few friends who love the place and visit frequently. Give it a shot if you're in the area and the many other bars/lounges in Town Square aren't your cup of tea. But don't order their hookah, stick to appetizers and drinks, and don't expect stellar service. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I will never step foot in this restaurant again thanks to the pretentious douchebag of a dudebro who treated us like he didn't have time to deal with us when we walked in on a Friday night. Who is this guy? His bro chums who were standing around outside smoking got the special bro treatment when they came in, though. I've eaten here for brunch once and had an overpriced sandwich, which was ok, but I thought I'd give it another shot on a weekend night. When we went in and told the dudebro that we'd like to sit and have a drink at the bar (thinking we'd order a small dish to start off) he grunted at my manfriend, ""It's NOT a bar."" REALLY? You know, considering the fact that I live DIRECTLY across the street from this place and listen to their noisy customers out howling drunkenly on the street many a summer night, it seems ludicrous to slap me with that attitude.

 Dr. Genet is the Worst Chiropractor Ever!!!! I have had many chiropractors that have done a great job and at American Chiropractic Center they Really Suck...... I will never go back and I would never recommend anybody ever go to this location. The Dr.'s at this location are only concerned about the money versus the patient. Dr. Genet acts kind in front of your face but really only wants to take money from the insurance company.

 This Comfort Inn is just a place to lay your head for a night's sleep in North Las Vegas. Located along a busy thoroughfare, it is especially difficult in the morning commute hours to make a left on Cheyenne Avenue to go east toward the freeway. The Inn is clean and simple. The room air conditioners are exceptionally noisy. The complimentary breakfast is the same at all the Comfort Inns: cold cereal, instant oatmeal, fruit, breads (all white), hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, juices and coffee/tea. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I am on the hunt for oysters, any way, any style. I get odd cravings for iron (I'd say ""blood"" but that would be instant freak status... oh crap)... so I hunt for oysters or liver (I am the only person my age who eats this as far as I can tell... freak x 2). Deep fried oyster platter with fries, got 7 oysters and it was ok. The meh rating is for the all other, rice & beans and the etouffee. I'd only came back if I'm craving oysters in the area...

 I had an iPod dock put into my SUV. Everyone was nice when I called to make the appointment and all my questions were answered. My problem came with having to return 2xs for them to get everything right. The first return we made was because the radio wasn't working AT ALL. My dashboard was put back together incorrectly (an oversight to the person who picked it up for me- he's unfamiliar with my car) so now I have to go back again. I wish I could give a better review, but the inconvenience of having to make so many trips back soured the whole experience. The guys that helped me were super super nice to deal with. They apologized both return trips. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've been to some great airport lounges, but this one was just okay compared to those. They have great, friendly staff and a full bar to get you through your travels. There were some light snacks, but nothing to really tie you over if you have a long layover. I would probably wander down to the Wolfgang Puck Express to feed my belly. I hung out here for a bit before my flight. They do have internet, but it is unsecure, so I just hooked up my laptop to my phone for some secure internet browsing. They had football on the tv, which would be fine, but some of the inebriated patrons of this lounge made for a less enjoyable experience. As someone else mentioned before, this lounge was frequented by an older crowd. A nice spot to get away from the hustle and bustle of McCarran. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I went here yesterday for a consult for Botox with Mary and was not impressed. I waited 40-45 minutes in the back waiting area while other women were whisked to the back for their appts. When I asked the check out receptionist to check on my appt because I have been waiting for a while, she put me in an exam room right away. The door was left open while everyone walked past and looked in, assistants and staff came in and out of the room to check a communal laptop. I was hardly acknowledged. When Mary did come in, she didn't introduce herself, tell me anything about herself or her medspa. Just handed me a mirror and asked why i was here. She looked at a sheet on the inside of a cabinet to give me pricing and dosage. I was not impressed. I told her I was a bit nervous (I've never had any injectables done before) and was unsure, she told me she had other patients waiting and promptly left the exam room. I also filled out on the forms that I was interested in vein removal, but she didn't discuss that with me. I had to bring it up to her and when I did she said she'd refer me to someone else, as she ""hates"" treating veins. I was appalled at the way the office staff treated me and left upset. I spoke to the office manager about my experience and told her I was angry, annoyed at the way my consultation was handled. I was referred by an existing patient, but that didn't seem to matter. She was very apologetic, but I would never give my money to this medspa. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We are quilters from outside of the Carolinas, and we decided to try this shop based on the pictures on their web site. While it isn't a huge place, they have a well-organized store, making it easy to find fabrics, rulers, and notions. Given that it wasn't busy, the staff member was willing to cut fat quarters for us if we couldn't find any of the fabric we wanted. She also pointed out that they had pre-cut full repeats of larger patterned fabric. Projects from classes were displayed around the store, making me wish I could come back for one. Best of all, they had a scrap bin: stuff a quart Ziploc bag for $3 (bag must close). Excellent for someone looking for appliqu \ u00e9 items or for small paper-piecing material. If we return to Charlotte, we will definitely return to this store. One more thing: They use an ID code for every fabric, and your receipt will list the numbers. This means if you want to order more of a given fabric, you only need to tell them the ID number. This is very handy! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Good place to grab a quick bite to eat or take something to go. Their special is always a favorite that comprises of two slices of any pizza and a fountain drink for $9.99...pretty stellar deal considering we're talking about a Las Vegas casino eatery. Make sure to have ample time in your hands if you order a whole pizza (10-20) since it is made to order. I recommend their artichoke and margherita pizzas...they've never failed me unlike the pepperoni and mushroom pizzas. Horrible thing about La Pizza though is that if Le Village Buffet's buffet line is long you're most probably gonna be bombarded with passerbys saying ""excuse me"" to you or rudely nudging you a bit, constantly, as you line up to make your order. Good place to go when everything seems busy at the Paris Hotel & Casino. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This was one of my favorite restaurants as a college student in Pittsburgh. It's a dingy-looking hole-in-the-wall that's easy to miss from the outside, but the interior is quaint and quirky, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the food is unique. My go-to entree is the mango pork, and the coconut rice, which comes with most dishes, is addictive. Keep in mind that the food isn't exactly mind-blowingly delicious, and it's certainly not at all authentic, but it's very tasty and very different compared to your other options within the same area and price-range. Great place for both small and large groups, too! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I had always heard about the legendary Hanny's from Mr. Dallas G and finally got to pay this place a visit a few weeks back. I have since visited two more times for drinks and apps and a bathroom stop. More on those. I was expecting some sort of sports bar type joint for some reason, I don't know why. Well, it is the polar opposite. Another hip downtown bar/restaurant that looks more like an upscale clothing store. Which, I found out it used to be. Ah-ha. The bar is in the middle of the joint and is brightly lit and open. What's cool is that they serve this thing called a ""small plate"" with prosciutto, fresh Parmesan, roasted pistachios, kalamata olives, and roasted red peppers. They slice the prosciutto and cut hunks off of a wheel of Parmesan right there. Awesome touch! Plus it tastes great and is only $4. The beer is also icy cold. I have also had the cauliflower, which has mushrooms, red peppers, chili flakes, and shoestring onions. This was really good as well. The bathrooms. Everyone talks about these things. They are upstairs, down this Star Trek-esque corridor with mirrors and tiny tiles. There is only one marked door for a restroom(Mens). All the other doors are for stalls, I guess. I haven't stopped at any of those. They are sexy bathrooms. My guess was that these used to be dressing rooms. The DJ ""spins"" music from his laptop in a little nook upstairs. This would be a great place for a first date or after dinner drinks on a first date. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Came and stayed for three nights, I don't think I'll be coming back. Firstly, upon entering our room we found fecal matter on the walls, yes, actual fecal matter. Disgusting! Second, we opted to pay the $10 fee/ day to rent a coffee maker but quickly realized it took at least 1 hour to get coffee in our rooms because the hotel staff delivered it very slowly. By the time you finally received your coffee making materials you no longer wanted coffee. It is ridiculous that we pay for this service and then wait an hour or more for coffee. The front desk staff listened to our complaints and really did nothing about it except take $20 off of our bill. I expected better especially after such a poor experience.

 Yes fellow Yelpers, I love yet another breakfast/lunch caf \ u00e9. I can't help it! Sunrise Caf \ u00e9 is a bustling little caf \ u00e9 in a convenient location, right off the highway. And next to a Starbucks, a bonus in my book. Huge selection so get to reading when you sit and with breakfast choices as good as the lunch choices, you'll have to deal with a battle within yourself regarding which meal to show some love. I absolutely love the Glenn Wrap, mainly because I have a severe Frank's Red Hot addiction that governs my ordering patterns just about everywhere I go. I love their hash browns too, not greasy or too seasoned, just right. For lunch I've made sweet food love to the Reuben and was not disappointed. The staff is super friendly and you can chill at the counter seating or choose from a table or booth. You can even sit outside if the weather is to your liking. Bring Fido or Rover along, they provide dog treats and water for their canine customers. If you're hitting this place up on a weekend be prepared for a little wait. Check out the shelves as you walk in, they've got some pretty cool old school candy. Who doesn't need some Big League Chew in their life? I could spend the rest of my life eating at places in this shopping center, for realz. Go support a local business and enjoy Sunrise Caf \ u00e9. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I really liked my Thai iced tea and the donuts looked good (although the display case needed some TLC) but the girl who worked there had zero knowledge of product ingredients. I asked if the donuts had high fructose corn syrup because that ingredient always leaves a funky taste in my mouth and gives me a stomach ache. She didn't bother asking someone who knows and didn't go and check the ingredients. She did check the some of the drink ingredients to find they did indeed contain high fructose corn syrup. Thankfully they had the Thai Iced tea that was corn syrup free! I would suggest they have an ingredient list available for their customers who care about what they consume. Just because I desire a sweet treat doesn't mean I want to eat barely digestible ingredients! If I want a donut, I want it the good old fashioned way- made with SUGAR, same for my sweet beverages. A lot of business cut corners by using high fructose corn syrup assuming its the same as sugar when in fact it is very hard to digest and causes fatty liver and other awful health issues when regularly consumed, not to mention the taste is inferior to that of sugar. Also most corn syrup is genetically modified due to the GMO corn used to make it. I love a good Boba tea but I prefer patronizing a place that is ingredient conscious and has friendly, helpful and knowledgeable customer service. The girl working there seemed to be annoyed I even came in :( So much for donuts tonight, maybe next time.. ",1,0,0,0,0

 ABSOLUTELY AWFUL EXPERIENCE! DO NOT STAY HERE. Unfortunately I had to give this 1 star, I wish I could have given it a Negative 10. Coming from an experienced Trump visitor, my grandmother and uncle own condos in both the trump tower NY, and Miami. My experience with the las vegas location was BEYOND AWFUL. My fianc \ u00e9 and I both got food poisoning from the chicken wings. To make things worse, service is absolutely awful. Jasmine Diaz, who took multiple orders of our in suite dining, yes we stayed in a suite, specifically 5911, was incredibly rude and unprofessional. After my fianc \ u00e9 and I got food poisoning, I called to order something of substance because after having food poisoning, we were desperate. She said, ""I can't see your past orders, so what do you what the freaking chicken wings or wha?"" I was flabbergasted. After being a loyal Trump attendant, also my grandmother's passing has left me to own the condo in the Trump Tower in NY, 721 5th ave; I am beyond astonished. I can't imagine how they treat residents in the ""standard rooms"", nor should that matter- I am thoroughly in shock and appalled. I WILL NEVER stay here again, save your time and money, and shoot for the Bellagio. Do not stay here.

Served with rice and refried beans, guac, sals, tow small cheese quesadillas and four totillas. Yum!

 I really wanted street tacos and I didn't think that I had been to Los Favoritos before so I stopped here on my way home a few nights ago. I walked in and the person at the counter was taking a call so I patiently waited for a few minutes. I had a change of pace and decided to get a burrito instead of tacos with some horchata. Waited not too long and I got my order. Once I got home and started eating, I realized that I didn't think that I had been there before because it's pretty forgettable.

Then the next day I get a phone call saying i did something wrong and could i fix it so they can get there money. So i tried and it kept kicking me for some reason so now not only do they want there money they wont me to take time out of my work day to come down and pay for it at the store. Really!?!

 This is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix, even though I don't get over here as often as I'd like. First of all, the interior is stunning. I love coming here when the weather is nice enough that the opened windows let in fresh air and crisp white light that fills the place. I've never been for dinner but that will have to be next. The first thing I ever tasted here had me trying to recreate its magic at home - a basil chicken sandwich: a large grilled chicken breast on fresh crusty bread smothered in brie aioli, basil and mushrooms. Their fries - truffle parmesan and otherwise, with tasty unique dips - are addicting. The zinc burger, mac and cheese, hanger steak are all very good. I loved the haricot verts and shitakes and ate the whole plate myself. However, the best thing I've had here, which is in the top things I've ever eaten in my life I'm so enamored with it,... is the dungeness crab crepe. If you like crab (which you should if you have a tongue) you have to try this and savor every little bite. I am a fan! Please continue making deliciousness forever. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I used to live on top of this pub but luckily two floors up so we didn't get too much noise. Apart from Saturday night when the Karaoke night was on, which attracted the local talents. (not) But they are allowed their moment of shine of course. To be honest the first time I came in here was during a fire alarm in our building. It was raining outside so we thought we would check this pub out. It is quite large inside, with two rooms separated by the central bar. There are booths and tables to sit on. It has a large food menu and the flashy banners outside always advertise the latest food deals. My Scottish friend swears by their sticky toffee pudding but I have yet to try it. The few times I have been here I was always taken aback by the drinks. My mixed gin and lemonade drink came to about 3.50 with no ice or lemon. The girl just plonked it in front of me and stormed off. Granted we all have our bad days so I didn't think too much of it until a friend of mine complained about the same girl a few weeks later. The rooms are separated by narrow corridors making it a bit inconvenient to pass through if there is a large group of people. However, even though this would be a good student meet-up point (and occasional it is for society meetings) it seems to have a very standard non-student regulars coming here frequently. It's not a special or original pub by any means, but you will always find a corner in this place for a pint. However, what did scare me once was a recent march of the Scottish Defence League somehow ended up here, even though a lot of pubs had agreed not to let this group enter their premises. The outsider seemed to be surrounded by policemen and skin heads. A rather bizarre sight for a quiet pub. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It's always a challenge running into anyone who's interested in helping a customer. Seems like every time I need someone, I have to go interrupt a group of employees are are just standing or sitting around having a conversation. I've tried just standing where they can see me, looking at things for five minutes, and they don't even move. As with all BB locations, prices are steep, and to get a reasonable price you need to pull up a competitor on your phone and ask them to price match.

 Baristas here are friendly & nice. No problem with my drink. But I have a problem with the set-up. There's no indoor seating.

It's connected to the mall, so I'm guessing most people aren't sitting & lounging, but most likely are just getting coffee and heading back to work. No drive-thru option. Plenty of parking since it's connected to the mall but that's also a problem since it can be crowded on weekends. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I went here for the first time with my friend. She said she's been here more than a couple of times and she said it's good. So I said why not, lets try it. We came in, it was very very slow. We were the only customers. And this is during lunch time which is normally noon. Right as we walk in we were greeted by a lady that could barely speak english let along understand english. We got to choose our seat, the booth. We were given menus and 3 minutes later the same lady came back and took our orders. I wanted a small at first but when she came back with our waters that definitely tasted like tap water....I changed my mind to get a large because I wanted to take some home for my boyfriend. She couldnt understand me at all, I said it at least five times that I wanted a large and then she just walked away and got another lady that could unserstand...so I told her what I wanted. So probably five minutes later we got our sprites which is pretty much filled with ice to the top..and we got our orders as well my friend (shrimp pho) mine (vegetable pho). Our food got to our table pretty quick. Like it wasnt even ten minutes. As I was taking a sip of my soup and eating my vegetables I noticed at least 10 of my vegetables had dirt on them, they were literally turning black already like they were rotting in the fridge and the kitchen still wanted to serve these vegetables. I picked them out and put them on another plate. I could say out of all my vegetables I didnt eat one cabbage at all because there was black stuff on them....like how unappealing! No one wants to eat food with black stuff on them. The broth was good but what really grossed me out was the vegetables that were already turning black!!! I don't think I'll come back here again. It's way overpriced for bad pho, with vegetables literally rotting in my pho. I don't want that and I dont think people should even be eating that!! that's not healthy at all. Yes they do have an A rating, but that's useless and basically fake if your vegetables and food in the kitchen are rotting and you still serve it to customers! That's just a health hazard! Who knows what else they serve that is rotting. This place needs to live up to better standards. Maybe THEN I will come back and try their pho again.....but not for awhile. I can't stand looking at my vegetables all dirty and rotting in my soup. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The lodge itself is ridiculously beautiful, and if I was just reviewing that, it would be 5 stars, but the food was overpriced and just stunk :( We stopped there after a family snow day, after seeing it a dozen times before and always wondering about it. I got the Philly Cheese steak, which was very bland, and if I weren't so hungry playing in the snow with my family for a few hours before, I wouldn't have bothered smothering every bite in ketchup! One of our kids got the Mac and Cheese, which was homemade, not Kraft-in-a-box like most restaurants, and she wouldn't eat it. Ever see an 8 year old turn away Mac and Cheese? We actually sent it back. Our boys got cheeseburgers, which got the same treatment as my sandwich. My love got chicken, which she said was OK. All in all, with a place that beautiful and relatively remote, they could certainly step up the food a few notches and make it a really memorable experience. As it stands, we will probably not go back to eat there again. PS - The chairs were really uncomfortable at the table, you walk past giant, cushy chairs in the lobby and fireplace area, to seat you in flat, hard, wedding rental folding chairs. My butt hurt.

 I really wasn't thrilled with our meal here. The service was fine, although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini, which was about 90% breading, 10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable. I had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini, still too heavy and altogether flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though, it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera, which was, strangely enough, very spicy (though the server did warn us about this beforehand, to her credit) and again, not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly.

I ordered ahead of time since I only have 30 minutes. To be honest, I was underwhelmed. This burger tasted homemade and to me that's not a good thing if it's something I can make at home. There was nothing special about it at all? No special sauce, typical hamburger bun, shredded lettuce and tomato. Umm did I miss something from all the reviews on how awesome the food is here. Although maybe I should of tried the checo fries or burrito? But the pictures look underwhelming as well. The inside is definitely a mom and pop shop, so it can use some upgrades or if they had the budget for it a major facelift would be even better. I'm not sure if the family that owns this place was working but the woman who rang up my food was friendly. If I give them another chance I'll be sure to ask Melissa Y. what to order since her review raves about this place. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I don't quite understand why AFTER a pedicure, my feet are now drying and peeling. That seems really counter productive to the purpose of a pedicure. Yes, my toe nails are now polished and shiny, but my skin is dry and flaky. Suffice to say, I'm not a happy camper and I'm drowning my feet in moisturizing lotion. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is a prime example of when people write reviews either because they have a really good experience, or because they have a really bad experience....unfortunately this is the latter of the two, and it's not just one experience, it's several. I've like really really tried to like this place. I even have two friends who work here, but I can't, I like really can't. The atmosphere is cute, the iced green tea is good, but thats kinda where it stops. This might seem harsh, it takes a lot to let me down, but sorry I've pretty much ran out of sympathy. They changed from order at the counter, to full service dining.... Not the smartest idea since the service whenever my friend wasn't work has not been the best. I served for years, and prided myself on how nice and accomidating I was, especially to picky customers, so I get serving... I get that you're a slave. And ya know what? I've been a customer to dining establishments for years, and I pride myself in being a nice, easygoing, and friendly customer too. I'm not about to ask for some weird order, come in with an attitude, or tip you less than 25%. I like not being difficult. However, if I walk in sit down and am looked at by servers, multiple ones, literally 3 different ones, who all happen to stand by the bar and chat and not bring me a menu or even say hi, because what? it's not your section? Puhleaseeeeee noobs, get your crap together. You're all working for the same company... the same team at the end of the day, I understand when it's busy, or when you have a brain fart, and these things happen, but it keeps happening. Subsequently, my server, who I actually believe is one of the managers, comes by with a menu, and takes my drink, and food order. I came in looking for a nice salad, I order the spot chop with chicken. It came out pretty quickly, and the presentation was really nice. I got excited. The chicken was cooked nicely, and was hot, but the flavor wasn't on at all. The salad itself was also a pretty big let down, and it's kind of because of one ingredient. THE CORN NUTS...It was like a really bad Top Chef vending machine food challenge gone wrong. You guys seem to pride to yourself on the use of local ingredients, so I'm sure you can find some farmer's market to pick up some fresh husks? lolololololol. Honestly I wouldn't be holding your food to such high standards, if you guys weren't pretending to do the same. So I finish this realllllllllllyyyyy good salad right? And my server never asks me how it is, another server actually comes by asks me if I'm finished and brings me my bill. As I am signing off my bill, my initial server walks by and looks back and makes eye contact with me, but does not come by to ask how it was or even tell me to have a nice day....girl, you are the best! I still have some of my green tea left and ask the new server if I could get a togo cup for it, because the iced green tea is actually really good. This new server, brings me a fresh green tea in a togo cup, with a smile and was really nice, thank you! Hands down only good part of my experience. So I'm sorry hillside spotters for giving you guys a pretty bad review, and to my friends who work here...I'm like hardcore bashing on your place of employment...but today, I think I would've been happier with a McShaker salad from McDonald's, than my 10.5 ""Spot"" Chop salad. I would rather you stay as an order at the counter place, so I can have my terrible and greasy breakfast torta, and leave 2 bucks on the table, and not have to care about your service, since you don't care about mine. Boom. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Mandarian Oriental was a lovely experience. I'm aware that some people actually live in this building and I swear if you stayed there and didn't look out your window. You would feel like you were at home. When they say they concentrate on customer service, they mean business. Everyone there was attentive and smiley. Checking it was a breeze and they offer warm towels to welcome you in. On top of that , they actually take the time to walk you to the elevator on your first visit. It's a simple yet very kind gesture. Free tea and coffee are available for you( only earlier in the morning though) and sometimes they have a server go to your room to ask if you'd like any cocktails. Not a huge fan of this though. If I needed cocktails /room service I would probably just call for it. but thanks anyways! The pool is a medium size area where you will certainly get a ton of sun. Not just because you're in the desert but because neighboring buildings tend to reflect the heat even more. Quick fix if you can't take the heat? slip into the pool that is never too cold or too hot. My experience here has been great. However, the price is pretty high so look out for deals because we got a great deal on travel zoo which was around $150 instead of their high average rate. On another good note, where else on the strip do you find workers there that say, ""welcome home"" before you walk back into the building? ",0,0,0,1,0

 GVR is a meh'fest. They don't do anything great, but they don't really butcher anything either. Food - OK. The buffet is standard, but you can count on it. The coffee shop is gone. China Spice has pretty good sushi. The Italian restaurant blows. Food quality at the casino-ran restaurants is average Station quality. If you've eaten at any Station restaurants more than once you know what I'm talking about. Food court is a win. Gaming - OK. They have full-pay video poker, including Loose Deuces, but the denominations don't go up very high. They usually get the newest games, but they're packed for weeks after they come out. And the slot-club essentially sucks. 1,000 points = $1 cash back. And not even real cash back! And multipliers don't count! And full-pay video pokers is $4 to 1 point! There was a time when Boarding Pass was one of the best slot clubs in town..that's no longer even vaguely the case. Amenities - OK. They have a movie theater. And a nice pool. Who doesn't these days? Decor - Faux fancy. And that's faux fancy from 10 years ago. Typical Station. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I won't be returning. Today, I picked up an order for my friend and I. They read back the order and it was exactly what it should be, but when I got to work, they had not put a rice krispie bar in even though they charged us for it. Additionally, my Japanese Pan noodle bowl left much to be desired. The carrots were uncooked (even though they were supposed to be) and ""topped with cilantro"" means one slimy spring of cilantro with 2 leaves on it. My friend's pasta was burnt. Burnt!

 OMG! Greenberg's serves up some of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had. If you're in Las Vegas and you love a mountain of New York style hot, freshly shaved, thin sliced meat on fresh bread of your choice you owe yourself a visit to Greenberg's Deli on the casino level of the New York, New York Hotel and Casino. My friends are thoughtful. On the day prior to running the half marathon I had a fairly late pasta lunch and decided to skip dinner in preparation for the morning's race. My race morning ritual is pretty simple. One hour before the race I eat a banana or a bagel and I drink a pint of Cytomax to prepare my body for the onslaught ahead. Cytomax is a fluid replacement liquid that has added vitamins to fuel the body and prolong cramping. Both of my friends were running in their first half marathon, and neither had any set routine for nutrition on the day prior to the race nor on race morning. They visited Greenberg's on the night prior to the race, and in thinking I was starving in my hotel room they brought back for me a huge deli sandwich with a side of potato salad and a pickle with a bottle of Gatorade. The time was 10 PM and the race was just 9 hours away. With no refrigeration in the hotel room, and two overstuffed roommates I was left with no choice but to eat the darn sandwich and the sides. Knowing my love for meat they brought back a Twin Bill consisting of a mountain of hot pastrami and corned beef with just a slight smear of mustard on wheat bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=u6ig5pKlEqhgsmAvUNWrkA). I swear the take out box weighed in at more than a pound with the thick pile of meat taking up most of that weight. The sandwich was incredible. The meats were nicely marbled, flavorful and moist and this was easily one of the best deli sandwiches I've had outside of New York City. It was even better than Miller's East West Deli in San Francisco, and I love Miller's. The big crunchy pickle was outstanding as well with just the right amount of sour to it. The potato salad was basically big chunks of unpeeled potatoes, lots of mayo and just a touch of dill. It took me nearly an hour to finish the sandwich, and I knew I was in trouble for the next morning. Sure enough, the big sandwich came back to haunt me at mile 10 during the half marathon the next morning. Luckily I run for fun, and I didn't really care that I finished 12 minutes later thanks to 2 pit stops I was forced to make. I was so satisfied with the sandwich that I made my own visit to the deli the next night to order another. This time I had the New York Skyhigh (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=QtjcS6CWBgSaD01Zry3urg) which is corned beef, pastrami, turkey, cole slaw and thousand island dressing on bread of choice. I even tried their authentic chocolate New York egg cream which is simply milk, Hershey's chocolate syrup and carbonated water hand mixed and machine whirled to create a thick layer of froth on top. Here it was without the froth (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=ekkd6tNYWjCU9Z-oXH3_4Q) as I had already sucked it up. I loved this sandwich just as much as the Twin Bill and the drink? Well, that was like drinking chocolate milk with fizz! Greenberg's is very reasonably priced too as their sandwiches are mostly under $10 including the sides! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Started the adventure around a year ago. Food and service so bad my husband complained and received a comp. We didn't want to go back there, so we redeemed it at their sister property, Silver Nugget . Tried again @ Opera House 2 wks ago, hubby was reeled in by 16oz t-bone for $5.99. Bad decision. Steak coated in pepper. Returned that and hard as nail potato. Results in another comp, $15 this time. Entire time , mgmt horrified their staff is that horrible. We take my father, probably for amusement value @ this point. Green beans are not seasoned, at all. We ask for them to be sent back, seasoned. Waitress brings back, in same bowl , with pepper liberally shaken on. I know this is a ghetto- fabulous casino, but pepper on everything ? We inform the manager, whom has a pow wow w kitchen staff . They smugly inform us we are no longer welcome. As if...I invite the manager to sample the green beans. She declines , stating she, the 90 lb skinny broad is not picky about her food. It's obvious the food that goes down her gullet passes stringent tests, unlike the employees she hires or the food they serve. Better off as a snack bar. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Have also tried Craft in New York and was very impressed. I had the NY Strip which was good, but the Rib Eye was unbelievable. We had a table of eight and were seated very promptly at the reservation time. Basic appetizers - arugla salad, caesar salad and oysters were all top notch. The sides were solid - hen of the woods mushrooms, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, etc. Overall a great steak experience. Craft is more of a modern and experimental experience, but Craftsteak is one of the best pure steak experiences I've had. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Do you know what's good ALL THE TIME? Breakfast! There's never a wrong time for breakfast food. Well, like most breakfast places egg works is only open half the day. That's okay, atleast my friend and I got there 40 min before they closed. I ordered the Crazy chicken omelet, well something like that. It was alright. It didn't stand out and the taste didn't amaze me. Do you know what was amazing though? They had banana bread French toast. I have never seen that at a restaurant! I was pretty excited when my friend said we should share one. If you come here, I definitely recommend it. I love that banana bread isn't that sweet, but very flavorful. The service was also very friendly. You know how girls get when they get brunch, it's never ending talking. Even though we were almost the only people in the restaurant we didn't feel rushed when we ate and caught up. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was almost positive I had the worst customer experience I've ever had in Las Vegas here at this store... until a few days later when I experienced worse (if it's even possible) at the Louboutin boutique in Forum shops. I'll start off by saying yes, I'm a young guy and I was dressed down in just a t-shirt, camo shorts, and gym shoes from flying in an hour before but I am still a customer no matter what. I told the associate who I finally stopped to help me that I was getting married next year and I wanted to purchase a suit for the wedding. The experience was basically ""here try this on.."" and a roll of the eyes. I wasn't really flattered by the fit and instead of offering to show me different ones, he suggested that I just go try other retailers assuming I knew nothing about their suits nor could I afford them. Being in Las Vegas there are a lot of tourist, but you should never treat someone so inferior to yourself nor speak to them in a condescending tone. I am glad I took all the money I was ready to spend at this poor serviced establishment elsewhere. Don't judge somebody on what they wear into the store.. I had the money to purchase what I needed but in the end customer service is what lost my business. Maybe the associates here should stop by the Dor boutique in the mall and learn a thing or two about how to treat customers. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I didn't want to take a cab because: 1. I was traveling alone. 2. Paying a ridiculous cab fare. Then I remembered the airport offered shuttle services to hotels. With the help of my Yelp app, I was able to do business with Super Shuttle Las Vegas. For $8, I shared a van with other travelers that were going to the same hotel I was. The driver informed us of delays due to road work around the airport. With a positive experience with the van ride, I decided to use the service again for my departure out of Las Vegas. I called to schedule a pick up from my hotel and paid my fare via phone. I just had to pay $8 plus a fee of $2. Still a great deal than a cab. A shuttle came 15 minutes earlier than what I was quoted. Thank goodness for that since I didn't have to worry about traffic at the airport. The drivers I had were great and friendly. Service overall was professional and helpful. I most definitely would recommend Super Shuttle Las Vegas. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I can't believe all the beer! I usually go here on a Sunday afternoon with my friends and grab a flight so we can experience all the different brews. They recently added a kitchen and while the food was pretty good the portions were rather small. I was in a fall mood so I wanted to try all the pumpkin beers they had. Unfortunately, they only had 2 available. If you're new to beer like I am this place is good because of the vast selection. You can try all sorts of things to see what you like and don' t like and it's not super expensive. Plus, they have a lot of TV's and there's always a game on. ",0,0,1,0,0

 A total dump worthy of a quick visit to see the lounge act. I wouldn't stay here, and imagine my rating would drop if I did. This is downtown. This is old school. This is the smelly part of Vegas you hear about where everybody with blue hair is playing penny slots and chain smoking Kool cigarettes. The Plaza is at one foot of the Fremont Street Experience. I suggest stopping in and walking through, but don't stay long enough for the smell to stick.

 The stars are for the fritters we got this Sunday morning. Actually, they were really tasty. I prefer mine a bit thin and crispy while these were puffy and soft. But again, that is just me. Amazing flavor though, and really hit the spot. The problem was with our cashier, Summer. Maybe she was just in a bad mood, I don't know. She just stared at us when we got to the counter. I ordered first, and as she turned to get my fritter my husband said that he would also like one. She turned back and rudely said 'What?'. Re-stated his request, she turned and got another. Never smiled, not even sure she thanked us for the business. Honestly do not remember because we were so taken aback about her lack of pleasantness. I love DD, so will definitely come back. Hopefully next time she will actually be nice. ",0,0,1,0,0

 First time customer with my husband and kids and friends. The other patrons consisted of mostly families with children and older adults. The service was fine, the food also was decent bar fare. My problem was with the noise. The volume of the music in the restaurant was so loud we had to shout at each other to be heard. This was at 4 in the afternoon mind you, and I felt as though I was in a pick up bar at midnight.

 I really really wanted to love this place. It comes highly recommended by so many people here on yelp plus it is located in a great spot. I liked Dr Ryan right away on our first visit. I was hesitant about her because she is so young but she won me over by the end of our visit. I decided the 30 minute wait must have been just an emergency issue and chalked it off. Today was my second visit when I brought our other dog in for his shots. I had requested Dr Ryan because she had been so good the first time. When I had to change our appointment a week out I decided to wait a few days longer just so we could get her. Well, again I was tapping my toes in the exam room. This time for almost an hour. I finally told them I had to leave and the staff offered me Dr Dutton who came in right away and gave the shots. Most places, would give you a break on the visit fee or write it off after making you wait almost an hour. Not them. Full price. The fact that people work hard to get to their appointments on time seems to escape some establishments. Blue Cross is apparently one of them. Only one person stuck their head in to say she was running late. Other than that I could have been running a prostitution ring out of that room and no one would have noticed. Sorry Blue Cross...burn me once shame on you...burn me twice and shame on me. I won't be returning. You have nice vets but there are lots of good vets in the valley that will actually value my time and business. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Had a couple of hours to kill and wasn't sure what or where to eat before watching a movie so we checked out what was on tap in the casino. Our choice was Vino Italian dining. So this has 2 parts, a dine in sit down experience and a what to seem from outside a pizza take away. No real reservation was required. We walked in and we're sat down to a casino style or standard Italian decor setting. The dress code was casual, so ladies leave your cocktail dresses at home, and fellas that bow tie you wanted to wear won't do you any justice here. The menu was your typical run of the mill american Italian dishes that neither disappoints nor gets your belly rumbling. We had unlimited garlic bread which seemed to be pretty fresh. And the glasses of wine were a heavy pour. (Smiley face) Ordered the pork stuffed shells. Now this wasn't a bad dish, it had some great flavor and interesting sauce that may have been made in house. A couple of Knocks on this place was the food was so hot when it came out, the sauces were still boiling on our dishes. We had to wait 15 minutes or so to even try it. So that was a little bummer. I can't give this place 5 stars, it isn't the worlds best Italian restaurant but if you have 3 star expectations, this place ain't a bad selection if your looking in the casino with half decent prices.

 I just happened to come across Ice Pan while wandering around Harrah's one night. This is definately a hidden jewel within everything the Vegas strip has to offer. At first I almost passed it up due to steep starting price of around $6 for a cup of ice cream, but it is worth every penny. This was the best ice cream I have had anywhere and I ended up returning 3 times in the next week although I transfered to a different hotel. Customers can choose from a variety of flavors and ingredients to add in and every order is made from scratch with fresh ingredients right in front of your eyes. Because fresh ingredients are used and customers have their choice of ingredients and type of milk, Ice Pan's ice cream is relatively more nutritious than other ice cream options at only 200 calories a cup. After 2 minutes of watching your creation come together, the result is a delicous creamy ice cream with the perfect blend of flavor and refreshment. Not only does Ice Pan offer great ice cream, but a fun and unique experience. The two guys who were working here were extremely friendly, energetic, and made sure customers had fun creating their ice cream. They even remembered me when I returned two days later! Since Ice Pan is tucked away in a hidden location that one will probably only find if they are going to the Harrah's Las Vegas monorail stop, there was never a long wait. This is the only location of Ice Pan in the United States and will definately be a must on all future trips to Vegas! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've been to Bluephies quite a few times. I think my friends think this is a more affordable ""fancy"" restaurant. I just think it's overpriced for the portions they give. My favorite appetizer here is the Jalapeno Superbird, which a bacon-wrapped, stuffed jalapeno with decent meat and cheese. I definitely recommend this and it's not that spicy. I don't recommend the flat breads here as they are tiny in my opinion. The Bluephie burger might be the most filling entree I've had, but it was just okay. The chicken pot pie is my favorite, but it's extremely small. Service quality varies from time to time, but the highlights of my Bluephies trips are the desserts. I can't possibly recommend anything; they are all delicious. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I wanted to order a salad to go one afternoon, I was close to this location, and I thought, ""why not, I've enjoyed the salad at hooters before."" I felt like ordering the Fried Chicken salad, but I wanted a little kick to it, so I was going to ask to make my chicken spicy. Other locations have done this for me before so I didn't think it was going to be an issue. When I called to place my order, I asked for the Fried chicken salad, and stated that I wanted my chicken tossed in buffalo sauce. The girl on the phone told me that I couldn't do that, but that they have a buffalo chicken salad. I specified that I didn't want the ingredients in the buffalo salad, and preferred the fried chicken salad but with my chicken spicy. Again I was told that I couldn't do that. So I resolved to order the fried chicken salad but with the chicken normal. Ok whatever. Note to hooters: when your guest asks for something that can be done, do it. Its a way to get repeat business. Not to mention when I tried to call again to place a to go order, no one answered the phone. Twice. I mean really? My vote: Skip it. Or at least try another location where they pretend to actually care for the needs of the customer. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I was whisked away to Phoenix with a few hours notice for work. I am from the SF bay area and have a wonderful brow waxer. I have to book way in advance since we both have busy schedules and now that I moved I have to travel farther to see her. Anyways I couldn't make my much needed appt with my regular waxer so I've been scoping out eyebrows in phoenix and if I like their shape I would try to get recommendations. Well the front desk person had some really nice eyebrows and she recommended this place. She said they were only good for eyebrows and don't ever go there for a pedicure. They charge too much according to her. So I go in to see Leah (the person that my hotel person recommended) and she takes me out back to this little room. The room looks very comfortable with butterflies on the mesh thing connected to the ceiling. It looks very clean. Leah excuses herself and says she's going to go wash her hands...I like cleanliness...however she returns in like 3 seconds. ummm did you use soap? So anyways, I'm hoping this Leah person would work wonders but I'm not impressed. I could just be used to my regular waxer but when Leah waxes, I guess it's ok. When she would pluck some strays she didn't really get them. In a couple of days I had to pluck some hairs myself. The shape wasn't all that either...and lemme tell you that my brows were really bushy. All in all I wasn't too impressed. I only paid $10 so whatever...I just can't wait to see my regular waxer in the bay. Oh yeah, she kept pushing other things on me like ""make sure you ask to see me for your pedicure or your next brow wax""...I don't like that. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I came here a few years back since I had never gone to a Brazilian steakhouse. The short of it is that the food is decent, but the service is terrible. My friends and I visited as part of ""Restaurant Week."" They have many servers who bring meat and slice it onto your plate, and you have the option to try many of their side dishes while you wait. Their garlic mashed potatoes were delicious, but I don't remember anything else that stood out much, so I can only remember it not being stellar. The meat was okay... if you can get it. The food quality is probably akin to a mid-level steakhouse. The service is another story. I can understand that they are extremely busy with serving all the people there, and that they can only bring specific meats every so often, but we were often left with nothing on our plates. When they did come around with the skewers, it was usually something that was not particular popular that night and hence something we were not particularly interested in. Most of the time we would still eat it, mostly because we were too hungry to wait for the favorites such as the tenderloin and flank steak. The frustrating part was not just that we did not get any food, but they often just flat out walked past us instead. We had the unfortunate luck of being seated next to three young pretty girls, so when the waiter even came within the vicinity of our table, they ignored us and walked to the table next to us instead. I told my friends they needed to wear lower-cut shirts, so my advice to you would be to go with an excess of gorgeous girls if you want to eat any meat. After spending two hours sitting around, most of us were still somewhat hungry. Finally, around 30 minutes before they were about to close and with the restaurant clearing out, they finally realized we were sitting there waiting. Suddenly I found a pile of 3 steaks on my plate, since the waiter saw we were maybe one of five tables left still eating. The food was good, but it was really not worth the hassle. Overall I give the food three stars and the service two stars. Maybe if I had bothered to go back again, the service would have been better. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I remember growing up and always seeing a 1 or 2lb box of See's on the end table in the living room. Pops has a huge sweet tooth, though you couldn't tell to look at him. So, usually the only time I go to See's is when I'm buying him a box for Father's Day/Christmas/His Birthday....etc etc. Thanks to Costco and their discounted gift certificates on 2lbs of See's, I'm not breaking the bank buying Pops candy. Not even 20 minutes ago, my fellow colleague said to me ""I'm going to be bad and walk to See's, as they have my Tipperary BonBons right now!"" She asks if I want anything, and of course I say no. Then asks me the fatal question, ""Do you want to take a walk with me?"" Not wanting to pass up on a walk, I go with thinking as long as I don't bring any money, I'll be fine. WRONG! I forgot about the free samples they give. Before I could say no, the gal hands me a Milk Chocolate Peanut Nougat piece. Son of a Bi*ch! I ask which pieces are less in calories as I'm picking up my wedding dress this Friday and I need to make sure my ass fits in it. LOL. She says the Milk Bordeaux (which is unfortunate because my favorite piece is the Almond Square) and I ask if I can swap the Peanut Nougat for the Bordeaux. She then says, well you can keep the Nougat and I'll just give you the Bordeaux. AWESOME! My colleague makes her purchase and the two gals working congratulate me on my upcoming nuptials and we leave. My boss was very appreciative of the Peanut Nougat piece I dropped off at her desk. And the Milk Bordeaux, amazing as always. However, not as amazing as an Almond Square would have been. ; ) ",0,0,0,0,1

 Goyemon is still my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant in town. Their specials have been better and better each time we come and AYCE dessert is icing on the cake.

 Horrible wait time which always seems to exceed the estimated times. They will NOT honor online pricing! After a half hour wait that was supposed to be 10 minutes, I went to Target.

 This place is almost a four, but cramped seating and blase service keep it at a three. Most all of the dishes are really good, but not quite excellent.

 You order with a grouch blonde college girl using an ipad2 but they cant afford to actually put toppings on your ramen. Bull. I will go until someone recommends better ramen places in Phoenix.

In all fairness, its not bad ramen, but this isn't how it is supposed to be done. The product should match the photos on the website at the least... It does not. ",0,1,0,0,0

 After a late night out, there are only a couple things that can motivate me to roll out of bed -- Sunrise Cafe being one of them. I consider myself a vegetable freak and this is one of the rare breakfast places where you can find genuinely good veggies in a lot of the main entrees. The omelettes are praise worthy and although the Garden of Eden could be tempting for you health enthusiasts I would recommend the Davezilla. The veg-overload in the Garden of Eden is hardcore for even me but the Davezilla is still healthy with some spice to offset the bland. I have never been disappointed with the create your own salad and whenever anyone at my table gets the signature muffin I hear about it for the rest of the meal. They look delicious and always come out piping hot! If one of my friends was writing this they would rave for hours.... Maybe I should just try one?! If you don't get there early there could be a wait but nothing unbearable. I love the outdoor seating and I think it's great that they have a mini 'treasure chest"" for kids to pick a treat out of. Overall, I LOVE THIS PLACE! I have yet to find a breakfast place that can top it. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I would have given Northpoint negative stars if it was possible. I wished have reviewed Anne H. posting before signing up with Northpoint. What she experienced was a tip-of-an-iceberg compare to us. We have similar experiences as Anne and more. Our company resides outside Arizona and have many homes Phoenix metropolitan area. We hired Northpoint based on their website claims and telephone interviews, which they made many promises. Good sales, but worst execution. - Extremely unorganized. Every properties we have ended up with tenant problems, extensive repairs, un-reconcilable charges, unjustified charges, and/or falsified issues. Yes, they falsified claims, invoices, and correspondences. - They lied to us constantly. We only found out after months of probing their claims. - They falsified repairs with duplicate invoices of SAME NUMBERS and SAME PROPERTIES (plural intended) and charge us month-over-month. Only after we questioned them, they removed some of the charges. - They failed to disclose that they were using their own employees to conduct repairs. Hence, constant repairs and claims were experienced by us. Of course they over-charged us as well. Worst yet, they would falsify claims, repairs, and created invoices, and charge us. We caught them do it. - In the aftermath, we found many repairs that Northpoint claimed were created to keep their repair crew busy. - Due to these falsified repairs and claims, they were having hard time producing proper records that we need for our bookkeeping. Months have passed since we terminated them. They still were unable to produce records for our bookkeeping. There were so many illegal and/or unethical practices by them, we finally gave up using them. We lost thousands of dollars using them. We would have filed a claim against them if the lost (time and money) justifies it. Just like Anne, we also have many rental properties in Phoenix and other states. We had some bad experiences with some property managers, but this is beyond words. We have never experienced this type of negligent and crooked practices. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY FOR YOUR PROPERTY NEEDS. YOU WILL REGRET IT. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I love bebe so I would've thought 2b bebe is pretty similar right? I know it's not the exact same quality since the price ranges between those two stores are night and day. I went in on a WEEKDAY NIGHT. Probably 2 hours prior to store closing. Customer service wasn't very good. I only had one associate greet me the entire time while I was there but I think she only asked if I needed any assistance because I was shopping at the section she was folding clothes at. Their layout of their merchandise isn't all that shopper friendly. Most of their clothes are hung on top bars and bottom bars. I'm a short girl (5ft 1in)....good luck to the other short girls trying to reach for items at the top bars. It just doesn't make a good shopping experience while trying to browse/reach for items up top all while having a bunch of other items on my arms at the same time. I made my way towards the fitting rooms and nobody was there to assist me. Or so I thought. A few moments later, an associate emerged from outta nowhere. Watcha doin hiding in the fitting room girl?!?! I know you had to straighten out the go-backs and such but the go-back racks are located in the front of the fitting room anyways. Accessories rack wasn't very appealing either. Bracelets were just thrown in baskets while earrings and necklaces were hung on racks in a messy way. Necklaces were all tangled. All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way JUST to come to this store. If I'm in the area, fine...I'll stop by. But this is definitely a ""meh. I've experienced better"" kind of store. I was only here because all their tops were 30% off. ",0,1,0,0,0

 After 13 months Norm R and I returned to Cleo's on Saturday evening, 10/19/13, and we remain totally satisfied customers who loved the food before and now. This time I went for the lamb chops I'd sampled before and they were equally perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, tender, moist, and just, well, perfect. The plate also included I think 4 stuffed grape leaf pieces, which were quite satisfying and tasty, and a bed of fluffy (basmati?) rice. There were perhaps two groups of 10-12 each, and one other pair of unaffiliated customers in the large dining room. Our server was friendly, helpful, and kept on the move. I did not notice if there was another server, but as on our previous visit, there was a separate person serving as bartender, so our server was not doing double duty. My water glass only went dry once for a couple of minutes, and never required flagging our waitress down for refill. Having a bit to spare at the end, we treated ourselves to a baklava, which unusually but deliciously, was served warm. Not so much a negative as a distraction, there were perhaps four barren, slightly battered small tables with chairs outside along the sidewalk. With no tablecloths or anything else, they just gave the impression of being a place for the middle eastern guys to sit outside and smoke, though they were unoccupied on this occasion. Overall however, we thoroughly enjoyed the meal and have no complaints about the service. Good Lord and Groupon willing, I'm hoping for far less time in between the next visit. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We went to try this restaurant when it was relatively new, about a month old. We ordered the lunch specials and the salmon sashimi that came with it was just amazing. It was a thick piece of fish that melted in our mouths. We were quite amused because it was the first time that we had such amazing sashimi. We went back about a month later, the sashimi pieces were smaller and thinner, but still top quality, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Overall, you get seated quite quickly and the prices aren't too bad. We prefer going during lunch time to get the cheaper deals though just because we are poor students. I wouldn't recommend ordering the party trays though...unless you love all sushi. I ordered a party tray and a sashimi set last time and found myself not liking a lot of the fish. They give you a lot of the less popular fish that has an overwhelming fish-taste to it. But that is just personal preferences. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I found this place on yelp and I'm always up for trying new breweries but ended up being disappointed. For entrees I ordered the green chili Mac and cheese and added machata to it. Which is a shredded typed of beef. It was a bit spicy but good. My boyfriend ordered the carne asada tacos and these were extremely disappointing for $11. The two tacos were only a little bigger than mini tacos. It came with rice and beans that came in those sauce cups that you use to put your salsa in. That's it? For beer I ordered their Christmas ale. It tasted really good in the beginning but I'm a slow drinker. After a while it got really flat and tasted really bitter. I was disappointed that they had such a small selection of beers for a brewery. The only plus for me was our waiter was very friendly and knowledgable of their beers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Let me start by saying I have been here twice. The first time was amazing with an amazing waiter named Terry, who did bar tricks for us and catered to our ever need, even to our friend who has trouble making decisions and embarrasses us! Only downside was the prices. The second time? I don't think I will ever go back. We had a waitress named Amy, with a high pitched and shrill voice, who forgot our drinks numerous times.As well as trying to be a bit too friendly, stealing one of my prize stuffed animals to my side and saying I should watch better...very comforting to know that my stuff could be stolen from me as I eat. Yes, she was nice and ok as a waitress I guess...but once it came to the bill, it said ""We added an 18% optional tip for your convenience"". The tip was going to be 25 dollars...we decided 15 would be good enough. As we left, she ran after us saying we ""were a bit shy"" from the amount due, We gladly pointed out that the tip was optional, but it seems Ms. Amy was NOT happy about it. ""I aim for 20%"" That's fine, but you didn't get it. She got mad and said she needed to talk to the manager before we left. This got us very angry, because she treated us like thieves or something. She then came back 10 mins later saying ""We can go"". Well, if I would have known she'd be pissy about a tip I'd have taken the tip back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Barber is really nice - the shop is cosy and seems very well maintained. I went in without an appointment, and the barber clearly was busy with a steady stream of appointments. Upon asking, he mentioned that he'd be able to squeeze me in, as long as all I needed was a haircut and I didn't mind waiting. This didn't pose a problem for me, so I sat in the waiting room for about twenty minutes. The haircut itself was quick and well done. He was amiable and made good small talk - he seemed to have a greater rapport with familiar customers, which is a very positive sign. The haircut didn't require too much work on my end. One very pleasant surprise was that he used a straight razor to trim the back of my neck. I asked him, and he mentioned that he does do straight razor shaves. He couldn't do one for me, since I was fit in between appointments. But if you're looking for a straight razor shave in town, this is the only one I've been able to find in the city so far. I'd definitely recommend an appointment though. ",0,0,0,1,0

The pool was very nice and never crowded, also had comfy pool lounge chairs.

 I've already written up a review of Orbitz (CheapTickets), but my recent craptacular experience at the Phoenix Airport must also be documented... Why on Earth would you make travelers exit the airport in order to enter a different terminal? Once you're in, you should be IN! I had the horrifying experience of rushing through the Phoenix airport last Saturday (don't ever travel around Thanksgiving, people, it's pure hell!) and to my dismay, found that I had to haul ass to a completely different terminal within the airport. Not a huge deal, right? Wrong! I had to exit at baggage claim, wait around for a little shuttle bus to take me to the different terminal, get out and wait through another set of security lines. All over again. WHY? Lame! Will avoid this as a connecting airport as much as possible! ",0,1,0,0,0

 My girlfriend and I wandered over to this restaurant while waiting for our Blue Man Group show to start and we were not disappointed. The bread sticks were warm and delicious! We started with the fried Calamari, which was fried perfectly leading to a good texture. The dipping sauces were a nice compliment to it as well. My girlfriend got the pasta Alfredo. She said it was very good, although I feel it is hard to screw up an Alfredo sauce. I also got a difficult dish to screw up, chicken parmigiana, it was very good though. I liked how they served the spaghetti that comes with it; the sauce was already on it and it was wrapped up in a ball and served on the plate. I posted a picture of this. I just liked how there wasn't too much sauce served with it, just the right amount. I wouldn't hesitate to go back and try some of their other more complicated dishes. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Stayed here between 12/26-12/28. Nice hotel with a few problems associated with aging hotels, and it is a bit off the strip. The room was excellent. My friends and I stayed at a studio suite, and it was a great room: two televisions, a queen pullout bed, a king bed, single bathroom, stocked fridge (you have to pay if you want any of the items), a fridge below that for your goods, an electric stove, a blender, the full works! It's a great room. There were a few things that were associated with general usage of the room like the lock on the bathroom door was a bit jammed and the television was slow when switching channels. Wifi was a bit slow, but works fine. My biggest problem with the Palms Place is that it is disconnected with the casino and parking. It is a big annoyance and takes about 10-15 minutes to walk from the hotel to the casino. If you don't mind walking (time to walk off the buffet!!!), then it should be fine. Bill Tip: There is a free shuttle that goes from the Palms Casino to Caesars Palace every 30 minutes until 8pm. Take advantage of this! Bill Tip #2: Depending on your location, a cab ride from the strip to the Palms Place would be between 12-18. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I am passionate about my fish and especially about my sushi. This place made me sad. Ordered: Maguro Snapper Salmon Skin Roll Tempura The staff looked like they didn't want to be there and the food was bland. The quality of fish was of concern to me. The fish looked like it was sawed off. The salmon skin roll was so so. Not too bad but not too good. I was seriously feeling bad that I dragged My GF here. I'm gonna have to make this up. They had AYCE but I had a hard ime eating what I had in front of me. Then the Tempura came out. All I can say about that was some parts of the veggies were burnt and they succeded in making a bland deep fried dish. That's it, strike three, I'm through with anything that says AYCE.

 Typically a place like this is not my thing but a smoothie called and I wanted something a little healthier so I checked this place out. The vibe here is a little strange. Feels like an extension of LVAC and I'm the only lazy bum who didn't work up a sweat prior to coming here lol. The decor is modern yet feels green and nature-inspired. I really like the look of this place. I paid an arm and a leg for my Green Leaf Berry Blast smoothie (note: 1 dollar off for checking in) and I almost had buyer's remorse as I waited in line. The line moved quickly enough and service was friendly but, hot damn, it took FOREVER to get my smoothie. It's the only thing I ordered - no food, just a smoothie to go. And I waited. And waited. And waited. Finally my name was called and I thought for sure this was going to be an out-of-this-world smoothie experience. All the hype, all the waiting, all that cash I forked over... built up to this moment. I try the smoothie and I'm all, ""eh"". Oh the sweet sting of health-food disappointment. I give it 3 stars because I like the concept and the decor, the service was good, and there are quite a few things on the menu I really want to try (pizza, wraps, etc.), so I'm sure I'll be back to update this.

 So this is my second dog park in one day. We have a new pup and try to make his days full of fun and adventure! After being to South Park's dog park this afternoon it definitely makes this one seem to fall a little short. First thing is first, this is a nice dog park, it fits the purpose. It is small, but sizable with at least a decent amount of room for dogs to run. It also has bolted in benches that you can sit on. There is a smaller dog park fenced off and attached to the main one for small dogs only. This is nice if you own tiny dogs who may be intimidated around bigger dogs. Since this dog park is smaller than the one in south park, no matter where you sit, you can see what your dog is up too. Whereas at south park, it is easy to lose track of your dog, if you don't keep an eye on them. Here is why I am giving it three stars. The ground is mainly dirt, no grass or wood gravel. This makes it very messy if your dog is playing a lot with other dogs. While it is just dirt and wipes off, it still can be a pain. Especially if they have a lot of dirt on them, plus you track that in your car. Second, to my knowledge, I did not see any water fountain or bowls that you can use for your dog to drink water. At south park they have this available and the bowls are all around. The only other downfall is the size. It isn't that big, so I feel like there is not as much area for the dogs to explore and run around in this off leash park. Overall, location wise, I would come back with my dog, but if I had a choice I would go to south park. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Interesting and unique take on the gourmet burger craze. Incredibly well executed and insanely delicious. Ive had the Spicy Miso burger and the Kiki's burger. I the Spicy Miso is hands down the best burger Ive had in Las Vegas since I started coming here for work every other week since April '13. Ive had at least one burger on each trip at a new place and Ive come back to only 2 places so far and this is one of them (The other is Hubert Keller's Burger Bar for his namesake burger, also incredible). If you can get yourself off the strip, the burger is worth it. The only reason I give it 4 stars is the service leaves something to be desired. Very rushed and both times way understaffed.

 I had an absolute great time at Furio! I just moved to Phoenix from Michigan and had been working for 4 weeks straight before leaving the 2 streets I know that take me to work. When I found out that my mom and grandma were visiting for a week I wanted to show them more than the usual strip malls I have grown to love. I did some research and found out that on Mondays they have an awesome special: Martinis & a Manicure for only $10!!!!!! I thought this would be a perfect activity for a girls night. Needless to say, I was RIGHT! I made a reservation on line a few days ahead just to be sure that we would have a table. The very next day a girl called to confirm and we were all set for the evening. Finding the place was not a problem and when we got there I was pleasantly surprised that we got a spot right in the front row. The martini menu was cute and ideal for a ladies night. We each tried a different one and sampled each other. Once our martinis were served it was time for the manicure. The people at Furio really nailed the ladies night idea with this winning combo. I will be taking many of my girlfriends here in the future! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I ordered the Land of Enchantment plate deciding that the pecan grill might satisfy my cravings for a properly grilled steak. I was very happy with the proteins, the prawns and steak were both cooked very well, and were both seasoned expertly. My only real issue with the meal was that the potatoes were ice cold and that the vegetables seemed very out of place, almost tossed haphazardly on the plate to complete the dish. My plate also felt very cold, so I imagine the timings just weren't right in the kitchen. The service was excellent though, and the atmosphere of the place was great. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Been there twice! Both times the food was good. Nothing to write home about but decently good. The reason for the 2 stars...the service! Wow! Talk about horrible service. The first time we went we sat for about 20 mins without our server even approaching our table. We finally had to flag him down and ask him if we can put our order in. The rest of the visit was more of the same. Us sitting and constantly flagging the server down for things we needed cause he never stop by on his own. 2nd visit was more of the same...had to ask multiple times for anything we wanted. Had to flag server down cause he never stop by our table. My cousin had time to walk to CVS and back before the server came to our table and take our order. I don't think I will go back. Service just really sucked. No one was rude or anything but being constantly ignored was not an enjoyable dining experience. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm am being overly critical in my review of Bentley's on 27th and were it not for how the evening ended I would be giving them a solid 4-star rating. However, let me not get ahead of myself. Firstly, the view, it's beautiful and it's clearly a major reason for choosing this restaurant. So, the setting and ambience do not disappoint. Starters were superb (blackened tiger prawns and luxury mac 'n cheese). Main course was good (dover soul and the seafood speciality). Although the latter was overly rich and could have been a little more balanced. The cheesecake dessert was however a letdown and it took forever to make its way to our table. Suffice to say that the best thing on the plate was the fresh fruit. Bentley's on 27 is knocking on the door of 4-stars but just missed the mark. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I came in to look at the jewelry to find a gift for a friend but I ended up getting dressed up by Mahogany and Louis. I love my jeans and t-shirts. It's so simple and uncomplicated. And it helps that my work and friends embraces the simple. But Mahogany and Louis expanded my view on clothing. I tried on a gorgeous Joie Eleanor blouse in Smoke. I loved how it looked but then Mahogany added a belt just below my breasts and it looked amazing. I never thought to add a belt. Actually, I think I own one belt which I haven't worn in years. But it was fantastic and so hard to turn down. I would rarely wear it and it would sit in my closet when it deserves to be worn. I tried on a bunch of black dresses. One of them I needed help zipping up and that's too complicated for me. Also, it didn't look the greatest on me. Prices were reasonable.

 This place is great! Cheap beer and great food. The wings are huge and so good, and chaeper than any place in the valley. I have had many things on the menue and I would get all of it again. The little cutie cooking & wait staff are so friendly and have all been there for a long time. They are so much fun. It gets packed for happy hour so get there early. The only thing I would want here is more seats at the bar but there are lots of booths. Love this place I go here at least once or twice a week. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Great spot for a quick but classy lunch bite! The duck and fig pressed panini is DELICIOUS and there's always a good choice of hearty side salads. The place is decorated in brightly-coloured Mediterranean-style tiles and the small narrow layout is great for eavesdropping! Sit by the large open window in summer - great people-watching!

 Our server was amazing, I think we could of been his only table (which some servers screw up not wanting to crowd but just end up not being around.) The gauchos werent very friendly, but I guess theyre not supposed to be personable. I was disappointed in the salad bar, not much there, everything is cold. When your card is green and you just sit down its a bit overwelming... then it dies off and youre looking around, asking for specific things, I never did see the filet minion again. Mashed potatoes were so boring. Bananas were good, but nothing special. Out of all the meats my favorite was the parm crusted pork (usually dont care for pork and am a huge steak eater) the steaks just didnt have any flavor. Some were really salty. Some things were dried out. Overall, fun idea, fun with friends, great if your husband can eat a lot, get your moneys worth. But for me, it wasnt worth that amount for that quality. Id pay $50 for an amazing 5oz filet over this any day. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We always enjoyed going to Proof but our last 2 visits, one was breakfast and this time for dinner we were disappointed. The view is all that it really has going for it. The service is friendly but still not up to Four Seasons standards. The menu has changed and now has fewer options. My fried chicken and waffles were tasty as was my husband's meatloaf. Both were very filling. The cauliflower side was delicious. But our biggest ""Yuck"" moment was when my husband got 1/2 down on his beer to realize stuck to the inside of his glass was a long blonde hair. When the manager approached he told him, showed him the hair and they did bring him a new beer but made as if it was no big deal. Doubt we will go back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 If I could put 0 stars, I would. I'm pissed: 1. The wait was ridiculous. Which is understandable because its LasVegas, but it shouldn't take an 1hr 20mins to get some damn fondue 2. Most of the dessert menu items are inaccurate. None of the Ice cream waffles had icecream unless you add 1 scoop of icecream for $3 a scoop. But all of the pictures of the waffles had icecream on them. So the menus needed to be updated. 3.The Vanilla Bread and Red Velvet cake that came with Fondue were old and dry. 4. When we got the check, we were charged twice for 1 scoop of icecream on the ice cream waffles. After explaining the situation to the manager, he made up a reason for the double charge but eventually took it off. But that's it. 5. The server was rude, and after talking to the manager about the waffle debacle, she became offended and threw the bill at us. (When we were gonna give her a tip because her service wasn't that bad) Overall, I'm never coming here again. Worst experience for a dessert-type restaurant. The only reason why this place gets attraction is because many celebrities have been there. But this is Vegas... celebrities have been everywhere, it's nothing special. ",1,0,0,0,0

 [This is part of a set of reviews covering establishments my family and I encountered while taking a road trip to Cincinnati.] I'm finally getting to the final few reviews from my trip more than two months ago. I guess I could have scrapped these last few, but that's not what Yelpers do. Is it!? This was your typical Courtyard by Marriot. Clean, well-run, friendly staff. They have a good-sized pool and a big, comfortable lobby. There were quite a few people checking in at the same time I was (the young lady at the front desk seemed a bit frazzled, but still very professional) and I was surprised how much room there was given the limited space they had cordoned off for registration. I would complain about the fact that there were only two elevators at either end of the hotel, but for this size hotel it didn't make sense to add more. It gave the feeling that we were waiting a long time because we had only one option, but that was probably just skewed because of my impatience of wanting to get to where I was going that night. I did take the stairs a few times when I didn't want to wait and going up and down to the third floor was surprisingly un-strenuous. They had enough room that the staircase was very shallow. Actually, a very unusual setup. I was a little disappointed in the morning when we were trying to get breakfast. Like the first Marriot we stayed on the outbound part of our trip, there were waffle makers, but these weren't self-serve. There was an area for a ""chef"" to make you eggs/omelette, but there was no one manning the station. Granted, it was early. But still. If you're going to have a station like that, shouldn't there be *someone* there? Even with that, we had a nice stay. Comfortable and restful before the drive home. ",0,0,0,1,0

 First, I will tell you I got an amazing deal. If I had paid more that I did for the room I would be complaining and getting the room comp'd. I had problems checking in, the whole process of checking in took about 45 minutes. The room was clean, but FREEZING, I could not get the A/C to shut off, it was 9:45 at night, I had just drove 4 1/2 hours, I had my 8 year old son, I did not want to wait for some maintenance person. So I called Guest Services, after waiting on hold form approximately 10 I ordered more blankets. (the room was 60 degrees). Now I know must people don't go to Vegas to sleep but I would be nice to have as an option. It wasn't for us, not with the Guns N Roses cover bland playing so close I could sing along with every word. Since sleeping wasn't an option, I thought I'd play on my iPad. I discovered I had to pay $10.00 for internet service - fine. I kept trying to log on, but it could not find my reservation. Again, I called Guest Services, after 15 minutes on hold I gave up. Time to stick my head under a few pillows and tune out Axl Rose. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Four of us went there to watch football. The games were on, but music was playing, so watching the game was not much fun. I had a $3 Sunday special bloody mary. Meh. Weak on the vodka, and the bloody mary mix just didn't taste right. Food: I had the ""fall off the bone"" pork ribs. Fall off the bone they did, but the reason why was that they were boiled to death, then browned in an oven and dunked in sauce. Was more like eating pot roast with bones in it. Awful. The onion rings were just so so, same for the chili mac & cheese. I guess the warning was evident when we walked in and the place was not very busy. Sorry...this is a ""one and done"" for me.

 This is a great neighborhood market - not too big or too small. They have excellent freshly-made sushi daily and will gladly make up a custom tray on the spot. Produce, meats, and seafood always seem to be fresh and in good supply. There's also a nice wine and beer section. I haven't tried their other prepared foods yet, but they seem to draw the customers. The employees are friendly and helpful and it's easy to navigate in this store. The only thing I wish they had was a recycling bin for plastic bags, although there is one for bottles.

 Nothing like what you saw on ABDC. Located in the Monte Carlo, the Jabbawockeez theatre has limited seating which is reserved and chosen when you purchase your tickets online or at the box office in the front. For $90/person, I came in with very high expectations. However, for me, there was too much skit and not enough dancing. Actually, the plot didn't make very much sense at all. It seemed like there was a story (which I didn't understand) and some random dancing throughout. Overall, I was highly disappointed and wish they had cooler stunts/choreography like they had on ABDC.

 If you're lucky enough to corner a cab - they usually are only around the hotels - unless you're going to the airport they tell you to fuck off. 4 times over the last 3 months I've been denied a simple fare from downtown to Shadyside, Oakland, Southside and Bloomfield. If you call, you're lucky if they arrive within the hour if they show up at all. Do yourself a favor, go with Classy Cab - they actually show up if you call.

 A little too far south for my taste, but CraftSteak is here as well as the Lion's Share slot. I've never stayed here, here but the MGM has become a part of our trip because of the legendary Lion's Share slot machine. The rumor is that this is part of an old bank of progressive slots and the casino can't remove it until it pays out. The jackpot was up to $2M in Sept 2012. To find it, go to the high-limit slot area and ask the attendant there where it is (it moves around the floor). Also, CraftSteak is near the top of our Vegas steakhouses list. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Lets just start by saying I love Nobu's Restaurants and that was the whole reason we chose to stay here, that being said the experience was terrible from the moment we arrived. The bellhop promised was busy, the check in staff was poorly trained and inattentive. Expecting epic room service forget it very slow and nothing special. Funny thing was I was having dinner one night at the restaurant and telling the waiter about the experience we were having and he said he would go over and try and fix it which he did. After he came back he stated he doesn't think they get it, in fact none of them have even come over to the restaurant for dinner to see what they should be living up to. Owe and I asked the concierge to if he could make me a dinner reservation at Nobu, he looked at me like what the hell are you asking me for, pointed to the restaurant and told me to go over there, I asked a second time and got the same response. Asked to speak to a manager that night, he came down was very rude, I told him I would just contact corporate the next day, he flipped out started yelling at me right in the lobby, refused to give his name when asked and stomped off telling me the general manager would contact me, she did 24 hours later, again no help and no service. Such a shame that what should have been a great experience was a complete let down. Last comment Nobu restaurant epic, Nobu hotel epic Failure! ",1,0,0,0,0

 We went here 2x. The first night was AMAZING. (The night before my wedding) then the night of my wedding after our reception we were all going to go out to celebrate. our promoter said he could get our party of 15 in. Our limo bus was late to get us and we were 10 minutes late for the guys to get in free (midnight). And we told our promoter and he said it would be fine and he'd get us in. We get there exactly 10 minutes late, tell the bouncer legit laughed in our faces told us that we couldn't get in unless the guys paid cover and we tried to text the promoter to help us out and they tried to heard us out of line and one huge bouncer shoved one of the guys we were with (who also was in a car accident and has back problems) and he looked at he manager who was there and asked ""are you really going to let your guy put his hands on me"" and the manager said ""I didn't see nothing"". Even tho he clearly did. My wedding night was spent at shitty bar on the strip when I was looking forward to being at this popping place. So I laid in my bed at the flamingo trying to fall asleep hearing the club going hard all night. It was such a tease :( I'm sorry for the low review but you guys need to get your people in check so your promoters give out accurate info. We would've been fine going in but the reason why it was an issue was with a $30 Cover the guys would've had less than $20 to spend on their overly priced drinks so it would've been pointless. Like I said if we would've known we'd have to pay we would've brought more money to get in!! It wouldn't have been an issue. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Not bad at all but somewhat overrated based on my personal experience there. $63 seemed excessive for 3 kir royals that our party ordered Apps were fair.

Female who brought our dishes and described the preparations was warm,pleasant, and informative.

 Ask your average Edinburgh resident where or what Black Lion is and they will probably point you towards the zoo. Ask your average nerd and they will point you towards Buccleuch St. If war-games, role-playing, board games, trading cards or anything of that sort is your thing, then Black Lion Games is the place for you. Don't be put off by its dark dingy exterior and grated windows, inside is bright fresh (newly refurbished) treasure trove for your inner child and suppressed imagination. There is nowhere else in Edinburgh quite like it. Black Lion should be intelligent-geek central. Given its relatively small size, the shop has a great range of stock. If they don't have something in, they will order it for you promptly. There is a nice variety of role-playing books, from well known games like Dungeons and Dragons and World of Darkness to less well known and independent games. The owners will be happy to help, and won't patronise you if you're just looking for a chess set and don't know what a level 20 Tarrasque is. The shop also supplies war-game miniatures and card games like Magic the Gathering or Legend of the Five Rings. To complement this nice dice, paints and other accessories are available. However if poring over vast tomes of rules and rolling dice isn't your sort of thing, there is also a great selection of classic and new board games and traditional games like chess, dominoes and backgammon. The staff will also be happy to get you started on a new hobby and games are sometimes run in the shop too. Don't be intimidated by nerds in their own territory, this place is worth a browse even if the closest thing to ""Magic: The Gathering"" you've got so far is the Beltane Fire Festival. The cost for board-games, role-playing books and miniatures always gears towards the pricey, but with the fluctuating popularity of such things, and the ever erratic role-playing market, Black Lion does a good job of just keeping itself going. It's also one of the few local, businesses like it, not just in Edinburgh but in Scotland and across the UK. A cool and original shop. Highly recommended. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Recently tried this place after hearing some good reviews and I spotted a groupon deal. Much smaller place than I'd imagined and easy to miss if you weren't looking for it. It was my first proper try of sushi so a bit clueless with what to expect and what to order. Staff were great helping us choose and explaining dishes. Ordered a bit of everything, fish, beef, chicken and even a couple of 'specials'; eel and octopus! All were great, some more to my taste than others, but prepared and presented perfectly. Washed down with a bottle of nice wine. The cost was cheaper than usual given we had a groupon deal (which was no hassle whatsoever), however prices were good regardless of this and I'd definitely go back again. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Oh... Taco Guild. I bitterly resent having to give you a single star. Pretty much everything is a disaster... from high-top stools designed by Torquemada, to the brazenly over priced drinks fetched by surly independently wealthy cocktail servers. Our server looked like a lumberjack, yet acted like Serge from Beverly Hills Cop. I had two tacos, ""torn lettuce cups."" What I got was half a head of wet butter lettuce with a neat tablespoon of sodium soaked protein in the middle. The pork adobo was indistinguishable from the coffee braised brisket. Truly stunning for $3.95 EACH. I have eaten more satisfying fare out of an MRE packet. It is loud inside, which amplifies the horrific choice to put a jukebox in a restaurant. There is a ton of service staff, none of which will make eye contact with a patron begging for a drink. The chips were fresh and crunchy, and the salsas offered were not bad. Perhaps that merits the single star I was forced to give. ",1,0,0,0,0

 From start to finish, the consumption experience here was quite bad. The only reason it gets two stars is because my seven year old seemed to enjoy her meal and our server, Kristina, was quite pleasant. We ordered: Atlantic roll Apple and brie flat bread Lobster Mac and cheese The Atlantic roll came out far too fast to be anywhere near fresh. It didn't taste horrible, but it was quite obvious that they used CANNED tuna. The flat bread tasted of nothing but burnt bread. No brie taste whatsoever. The apples were also undercooked. The lobster Mac and cheese tasted completely bland. This is the kind of place that apparently doesn't believe in putting salt and pepper on the tables; you would think they would at least season their food correctly. The lobster was over cooked to the point of being rubbery. The pasta was cooked well passed what is proper. All around bad dining experience. Even the water tasted terrible.

 Small stadium and would have great views all around if they did not use ""bleacher"" style seating in the 300 section. We were unaware of this when we bought ""best available"" tickets to a nearly sold out event. Once we were seated there was really no way in or out, the bleachers flexed from weight and we could not see anything for nearly the entire 4 hour event. This was a very kid friendly event and it was nerve wracking keeping the little ones from tripping and falling through. I will definitely use more caution when buying tickets at this venue, and probably call to ensure the location of my seats. Also, the concession stand nearest us ran out of food before the event even started. Because we were unable to leave our seats due to crowding, we were unable to eat anything until midnight when we finally got out of the congested parking lot. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Okay so I came here in Feb and they took my review down!!! So I am putting it back up. You can't take down people's reviews because you don't like what we think of your restaurant. FEB 2010 After reading numerous great reviews for this sushi bar, my fiance and I came here, ready to stuff ourselves with sushi. Worst decision EVER!!! The sushi was ok and the rolls were disgusting. The spicy tuna roll tasted like it had been pre-made and sitting in the fridge all day. The few rolls we tried that could pass as just average sushi hardly had any fish. They were mostly rice and vegetables. We kept trying different rolls hoping that it would be amazing like all the reviews had stated but we were so, so wrong. We left with a $100 bill and still hungry. Whoever wrote that this place was a top restaurant obviously does not know what good food tastes like. We love Sushi Fever, but like others have written it is a little over-priced which is why we chose Naked Fish. We were shocked that we spent more money than we've ever spent at Sushi Fever for gross, grocery store quality sushi. ",1,0,0,0,0

For starters I ordered the Roasted Beet Salad which had a lovely presentation and included Fris \ u00e9e, pistachios and goat cheese. It was really good, but didn't surpass my favorite from The Parlor. My friends had Oysters and the Tuna Tartare which they both enjoyed. For dinner, I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass which was good but for $35 didn't have the best texture and the sauce was a bit saltier than I would have preferred. Perhaps I should have ordered a Steak at a place called Modern Steak? Small oversight on my part... Friends had the Heart Brand Akaushi 8 oz Filet...($78!) and the Beef Short Rib, Horseradish Gnocchi & Red Wine Jus, much better priced at $28. I tried the Short Rib which was excellent and they enjoyed the Filet, however it 'wasn't comparable to his $200 Kobe beef experience in Japan' - but then again, I have some high maintenance friends. As far as the interior goes, Hayes Studio did an incredible job. I actually enjoyed sitting on the mock patio inside the mall with the over-sized lampshades and artificial round plants while taking in all of the textures. At one moment I felt I was in some classic side street in France until I realized I was staring at Banana Republic and remembered I was in Scottsdale Fashion Square. But a girl can dream, can't she?

 Although I usually like the food and atmosphere at Cracker Barrel, this visit with my wife and daughter did not end well. I had the country fried steak dinner, with greens, Mac and cheese, and okra. The flavor was great, but within an hour after leaving the restaurant, I was hit with some serious food poisoning. Luckily, neither my wife or daughter ended up ill, but I am dealing with the after effects today with severe abdominal pain and most of my day spent in the lavatory. Never again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The bf & I enjoyed acoustic live music on the patio for an impromptu date night. They have an extended Happy Hour, and that's about the only time I would eat & drink here. Being a local, I am not too excited about a $16 martini unless I'm on stay-cation, but at $7-$8 during HH they are good. We shared the Seared Ahi ($12) & Portobello & Steak flat bread ($6). Food was okay. I've had these dishes a few years ago and they were great, but something was different this time. Service was okay & she did check in with us for last call on happy hour. I have been afterhours with a bunch of girlfriends....wouldn't suggest that to anyone. It's a meat market, & not a good one. ::shudder:: that was a 1 star night. I oscillate btwn 2 stars & 3 because my bf & I enjoyed our dinner date on the patio with music but everything else was just ""okay"". I really want to say 2.0 but I'm being very kind...just stick with 4-8pm & live music. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The owner Pauly is rude. I work in an office close by and we received free delivery if over $15.00. I ordered three lunch specials and got grief from him stating they are usually only used for large orders. Well Pauly, don't put max of $15.00 on the delivery and be more specific. He always rubs me the wrong way and comes off very rude. I guess that's the New York type of guy that is RUDE. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the food. I usually get the white stone pizza and salad. The dressing is to die for. Today, my family came by my work to have lunch with me and so I called and preordered it for take out b/c I wasn't sure if we were eating there or not or back at the office. But after I took the order over the phone, my coworkers wanted to order out as well and I was going to pick it up for them. So it ended up being a dine in instead. When we were standing at the front, I looked up at the owner and smiled. He just looked back and didn't crack a smile at all. Just a rude person, I guess. So we got our food and I could hear the owner wasn't happy that I got take out and we ate in. Saying that was a take in NOT a take out. Same day my family dined in, my coworkers had ordered for 11:30 am so I could take it when I leave. Well, the owner asked too, this is for you. I answered yes. When I was walking out the door, I noticed that my coworkers pizza was placed on a paper plate and in a paper bag. Typically, they put the piece in a to go box. I took a pic of it and it's my screen picture. This is ridiculous and RUDE. Pizza and food is good if you can get over the owner that works there. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Tastes and presentation are not lacking. Hostess with 2 braincells is. Why she sat a couple like us on a date next to 3 drunk businessmen, in an empty restaurant baffled me. Lesson learned, speak up if your hostess is stoopid. The servers are eager to push you to drink, drink, and drink some more. I can only imagine this is to help you tip with a generous and faded spirit. It's a shame the service doesn't mesure up to the menu. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I am a huge fan of Vietnamese food, so we decided to look up a place to go on Yelp while we were in Vegas. I thought with the amount of Vietnamese Restaurants in Vegas, there would be a really great one! Well, sorry to say.... this is NOT it. I don't understand where all the great reviews came from, but I thought the food here was terrible! The soup was 'warm' at best, the broth was tasteless, the noodles were a mushy lump in the bottom of the bowl, the meat tasted 'off'', and the service was terrible. They got our order wrong, and didn't care. Didn't even ask. We certainly won't go back. I had an upset stomach all day after that place. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Great catfish here. Cajun seasoning is THE BOMB. My mistake for eating with my eyes because I thought 1 piece wouldn't be enough for me so I chose the 2 pieces 2 side deal. I was so wrong. One piece did the job for me, and I think it's because of the thick fillet. The catfish was meaty. Catfish had a nice, crispy, corn meal breading around it with a nice tender catfish fillet. I got the mac and cheese as a side and the corn on the cob. Both delicious. I also tried the fried okra. I'm not a big fan of okra, but the breading on that fried okra was a great combo. I tore that okra up! $9.99 deal. I call that a freaking steal! (hee hee that rhymed) ",0,0,0,1,0

 First time at Gingerroot and we ordered the fried spring rolls, beef caldereta, and dinuguan. All the dishes came out in family style portions which was nice because we were starving. The spring rolls came out nice and hot, just the way I like them. The dipping sauce was delicious as it had a nice balance between salty, sweet, and spicy. The beef caldereta reminded me of plain beef stew and the beef chunks were a lil on the tough side. This dish was just ok. Now the dinuguan disappointed me because it turned out to be a pork dish made with blood. The description on the menu said it was pork in brown gravy. I'm not Filipino so I was expecting what the menu described. Well to me there is a big difference between brown gravy and blood. I'm not fan of dishes made with blood so I finished what I put on my plate and couldn't eat anymore. The menu was misleading on this entree. I think I'm gonna try the chicken adobo next time.

 I typically try to wait until I have a few experiences with a restaurant before jumping into a review. So much can change from visit to visit that I always find it a bit presumptuous to assume that a place is 5 stars worth of awesome or 1 star worth of non-awesome based on one measly visit. And yet one measly visit to the Bronze Cafe, oh, 2 hours ago, and here I am anointing it with 5 stars. Enter the Tree of Life. The Tree of life stars Brad Pitt in a Malick film about the life and the universe. Yelp/RottenTomatoes Crossover alert! Okay so this Pita stuffed with veggies and other vegan goodies like a cashew crema and a brazil nut crumble has nothing to do with the movie, but much like I had left the theater after seeing Tree of Life, I had a lot of questions about this Tree of Life after I left Bronze Cafe. Namely: was that one of the tastiest pita breads I've ever had? (yes). Did I really just enjoy a Pita stuffed without any meat products? (yes). Did I really just order something called ""Banana Boy Bait""? (YES) Well how I really ordered it was I said something along the lines of ""and one of those banana bread things"". Then the guy who seemed to be running the joint goes ""Banana Boy Bait?!"" to which I looked around sheepishly before saying yes. It's totally worth any stares you might receive though. It lasted all of 3 minutes on the table. I'm not joking when I say I plan to try every sandwich and every Vegan dessert on the menu before my own personal Tree of Life wilts away and has me feasting on dirt and worms. Service was friendly, quick and efficient. The dining area was clean and there wasn't any air of pretentiousness that I think Vegan friendly places can oftentimes be stereotyped with. In fact it was the complete opposite. I didn't need to use the restroom so I didn't get to participate in the gender neutrality that it provides. The thought excites me though because I've heard from some of my female friends that sometimes you all have couches in there sometimes and I'm curious how this translates here. I've got my fingers crossed for a La-Z-Boy recliner personally. ",0,0,0,0,1

 First off, let me say, this is the real deal. I love Henry's Taiwan in Tempe, and when I heard about this opening up in Mesa by my home, I couldn't have been more excited. The food is great, the service is great, the atmosphere is great! If you have been to the one he owns in Tempe, the menu is a bit different, but has over 200 different items. This location is a bit more upscale than the other one, but still very casual and fun. If you're new to Taiwanese food, I must note (Just as John's wonderful review did) that it's much different than Chinese food, but certainly not in a way where your taste buds will not be pleased. The owner will make a great recommendation based on your preference if you're feeling unsure about what to get. Tonight was my first experience with this location. The food was absolutely delicious and the chef they hired is excellent. The owner could be the nicest man I have ever met in my 30 some-odd years. He provides great service, cares about what he does and has great staff working for him that all seem genuinely happy to be working there. I wish them nothing but success! ",0,0,0,0,1

 0 stars. Whatever you do, avoid this shuttle service at all cost!!! This was the first and only shuttle that I found coming out of the United terminal, and it seemed reasonable at only $6 each way. I decided to prepay for the return trip. I have to say that the trip from the airport was uneventful. I was able to get right on a waiting shuttle that was pretty much already full, so we left right away and arrived at the Vdara after only a couple of other stops. The return trip, however, was another story... All of the shuttle services require that you call the day before departure to schedule a pickup time. We had an 11:30 am departure, so when I called they scheduled our pickup for 9:00 am. We got up a bit late having stayed up until 3:00 am and rushed through our breakfast so that we would not miss our pickup. We waited. At 9:10, still no shuttle. I call them and am told that the driver had a couple more pickups and would likely arrive in 7 to 10 minutes. 9:20, still no shuttle. During this time, mind you, we see several shuttles arrive / depart from other services. 9:30 still no shuttle. Another person waiting right beside us asks if we are waiting for Executive Las Vegas. Apparently he is too and has placed a couple of calls and was told the same thing...the shuttle should be arriving in 5 minutes. I call again at 9:40, am placed on hold, and then get disconnected. At 9:50, an Executive Las Vegas towncar arrives, apparently to pickup the person that was sitting next to us. We tell the driver that we have been waiting for 50 minutes as well, and he says that he was only told to pickup one person. We practically have to force our way into the towncar as well, otherwise who knows how long we would have ended up waiting. As several other reviewers have stated, do yourself a favor and avoid the lousy service at Executive. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Solid pizza joint in the Miracle Mile shops (near Planet Hollywood and Hilton Elara). I've eaten there 3 separate times when in Vegas. Friendly employees. The pizza is a thin pizza, not a thick pan pizza. The strombolis are great. You can get free refills on your soda but you have to ask because it's behind the counter. The prices are steep, but that's to be expected for the location. $37 for a large pizza to go. ",0,0,1,0,0

 My wife asked me to come to this show, so I begrudgingly joined her for this debacle. Let me say that the audience and ambiance is fairly entertaining. The booze is reasonably priced, and you leave feeling like you've seen a Vegas show. With that said, Brit Brit is really past her prime. She barely moves around the stage except to prance about, and at one point she actually flails around the floor like a fish struggling to breathe. The background dancers are solid. It's good to see some of the Fly Girls found work. They're making the best of an embarrassing situation. Britney on the other hand, well, she doesn't really ""dance."" She moves her hands around like the sign language guy at Nelson Mandela's funeral, while she bobs her knees and looks disinterested. The audience was entertained, but everyone was kinda looking around like, ""WTF"" is this? To be clear, she only speaks twice, and I'm pretty sure she flubbed her lines at one point. I mean, she's very clearly not singing, and the vocals are still a D+. If you're a fan, I would see the show. I wouldn't expect vintage Britney, but it's entertaining nonetheless. Have fun!

 Pretty much my favorite place for breakfast in AZ. I always get the #10 omelet (bacon, potato, green onion, sour cream, and cheese) with no potato add avocado. Sooooo gooooood. This is one of the few places I order omelets because they are really good. The omelets are always light and fluffy, their home fries are really good and different from any others I have had, and their toast is amazing. They toast a french wheat baquette which takes toast to a whole other level! The husband usually gets the green chili pork omelet which is a special on the weekends. He absolutely loves it and I will admit that it is pretty dam tasty! Other things we have tried: cinnamon roll was huge and lovely, chicken fried steak and eggs which is a special on the weekend, and biscuits and gravy which is huge and the gravy definately taste homeade. The prices are good and the service is always good with a really friendly staff. I never have to wait for my drink to be refilled and the food comes out pretty quick. The only thing you will be waiting for is a table. Unfortunately, this place has a huge following of people that love it but the restaurant itself is tiny. Ive seen master bedrooms larger than this place!!! Expect to wait at least a half hour if you come here during normal breakfast hours. Ive noticed if you sleep a little later though and come around 11:30 or 12, its not nearly as crowded. Also, this place does not have indoor waiting. You put your name on a list outside and you wait outside. There is shade but during the summer months, it obviously gets hot. So be prepared for that. If you can handle the wait, you will definately agree that this place is the best little diner for breakfast in AZ! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Finally decided to pay a visit here after taking the kids to Freedom Park - I've seen Pike's from the light rail and always wondered what it was like. Decor-wise it's a funky mix of old fashioned soda shop (complete with wooden floorboards) mixed with gentrified warehouse chic (complete with exposed girders). The outdoor patio looks really inviting and mellow, especially considering the location (busy corner in the South End). The menu has a plethora of diner/soda shop standards, notably burgers, sandwiches, and comfort food like fried chicken and meatloaf. The kids ordered the hot dog and grilled cheese kids meals, along with the upgraded milk shakes (of course!). Based on the advice from our server I ordered the Carolina Classic burger - you guessed it, 1/2 pd patty with chili, coleslaw, mustard and onions. Asked for their house chips on the side. Some observations: 1. The kids meals are impressive in both their size and quality - the hot dog was a kosher beef one, grilled perfectly. Came with two sides, fresh fruit and the house made chips. The grilled cheese was also high quality and overflowing with gooey monterey jack. For the extra $1, the small milkshakes are a steal! 2. The house made potato chips rock -perfectly fried and salted. Completely addictive. They should really create some sort of nacho dish with these. . .if you ladle their house made chili and sprinkle some cheddar on top you would have a heavenly appetizer. 3. While the burger was very good (cooked on a griddle, which I prefer) the chili was stupendous! Meaty, complex, thick - perfect for a burger and made me want to scoop up the leftovers with the chips! Service-wise, no complaints - prompt, friendly and honest. Overall this was a great experience and I recommend it to anyone in the Dilworth/South End/Uptown area. Great option if you are at Freedom Park or Nascar Hall of Fame and want a comfortable place for you and the family. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was going to order from here once more before I made a review, but that won't be happening. I ordered delivery through grub hub. The driver was late because he was stuck in traffic and called me while he was on his way to let me know. No big deal, I'm a pretty patient person. I ordered a soup/noodle bowl with chicken and rice noodles. It was packaged separately. I also ordered the spring rolls, which were great, just needed more sauce. When I reheated my soup the next day to finish it I found an entire shrimp at the bottom, tail on and everything. It was a big one!!

 Basically, I should just copy and paste Pourina's review because I had the same issue w/ my 3Gs as he. But I will not, as this branch location of the Temple of Steve Jobs has issues a brewing (e.g. cleanliness, clutter, and unhappiness of the employees). Atmosphere - This is my 6th visit to this Apple store in as many years and on this visit, you would have thought they had just released a new Apple product that morning. It was a Thursday evening and the store was a mess...with frazzled looking employees to boot. The display items appeared ratty and gross. There were people everywhere and nobody really seemed that happy. This was unlike my prior experiences at this site or other Apple Stores in major cities. Maybe the CLT needs another Apple store or at least a bigger one. Now on to my issue as copied from Pourina: ""If you don't already know, within a year of contract signing, Apple will replace your iPhone if it's damaged (unless accidental). If you have a cracked case, they don't just replace your case, they replace the entire phone and you get a brand new one! WOW!"" Service - Always, per others, make an appointment for warranty/ repair issues. I did not...stupid me. But upon arrival, I did make an appointment for an hour later and shopped elsewhere to kill time. Pourina continued: ""For that very reason, the appointment system works and works well. No more fussing and cussing. You can set up an appointment on the phone or in store. Show up, check in with the friendly host and get on with your business."" When I came in for my appointment an hour later, it took only 5 minutes for the technician to look at my phone, ask if I backed it up, wipe it clean of data, and provide me with a like new refurbished phone for me to be on my way. Now that is service! Overall - I am happy I purchased the extended warranty as it is worth at least the cost of a replacement battery. While the repair service was quick, I am concerned with what I observed on my visit as it appeared to me that this store is on a decline that is counter to the normal Apple experience. ",0,0,1,0,0

 It isn't anything spectacular but it isn't terrible either. Sometimes the food is a little extra crispy and sometimes it is just right. I would give it 4 stars but really must give it 3 because it isn't consistent every time and certain things have been questionable. I will say this though, IHOP is right across the street but I would defiantly choose this place over them any day. That still doesn't say a whole lot about this place. I usually order waffles. If it isn't overcooked it is very tasty. I tried the chicken and waffles once but the chicken just seems like a frozen chicken finger they nuked and put on top. The eggs are usually the only thing cooked perfect and they do taste good. I have asked for sides before such as extra ranch or mayo and gotten weird extras in the cup it was brought in. Basically, this place isn't bad every once in a while but to take family and friends I would go t Rachel's Kitchen or up to Bagel Cafe. I get a coupon every now and then in the mail and that is when I generally eat there. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've eaten here twice, the first time, the food was interesting and flavorful, though I think they sometimes try to be a bit too clever with the menu. Sometimes simplicity is best. The second time, I think I ordered some sort of fish and it was covered in so much brown sauce that I could not see what I was eating. Also, the asparagus was grilled to the point of being charred to a crisp in some sections. I also think that their price point is a little too high. I realize they are going for the finer dining demographic, but still a bit too high in my opinion. Also, the interior decor is a little too busy (borderline gaudy), they need to mellow it down because, in combination with some of the loud artwork, it can be a sensory overload. This is a gay-friendly establishment. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I spent some time here one weekend and really enjoyed it. It is a great atmosphere for studying/creative pursuits. I ordered the Chili Burrito, and eventually the cheesecake and both were really good. I did not realize that the whole menu was vegetarian/vegan, but the chili burrito totally exceeded my expectations. I had a white chocolate mocha and a hot chocolate (I was there awhile). Both were very good. I give this location 4 stars because while it totally satisfied my desires for a unique coffee shop that reminded me of the northwest, the artwork was a bit risque. It was good, but I would not take children there. Otherwise, it was a fabulous atmosphere. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I used to frequent this place A LOT in middle school (or was it high school) well, I'm pushing 30 now and boy has this place gone down since then. I've stopped by a few times in the past years, but I'd have to say, this last visit will be my last visit. I stood in line for almost 45 minutes, granted it was busy, but holy moly! When I ordered my drinks, I made sure the girls understood it was a ToGo order so I didn't want a mound of ice on top to spill everywhere. She said she understood, but lo and behold, when I got my order, two big heaps of ice on our cups. Cool, easy fix, I scraped them off into a trash can, and off we went. Now, I understand, I used to come here all the time when it first opened, when they actually started out in AZ mills, but I remember when the cream was throughout the entire dessert. Nope, not anymore! Since I had to scrape off the tops, we were left with no cream! Boo! That's half the reason why this place rocks! But whatever, it's cool, kept eating, when I got a quarter down my drink I was disappointed to find dry, no liquid drenched goodness! Wtf?! By this point I'm pretty upset, not gonna lie. I dumped mine out to prove to my husband it just didn't seep to the bottom. I was right. Bastards! And then! To top it all off, I ordered the bahama mama Rama for my son, so it was supposed to be a treat to have the ice cream on the bottom, yup, non of that either. What the hell dude?!

 Comparing the Richard Verney Health centre to the community care centre back home, this doesn't score highly. Positive aspects: -Many doctors to choose from. -Some really nice doctors who seem to give you all the time in the world... -Very conveniently located for university students. Negative aspects: -Really long waiting time for everything. You wait forever to see a doctor even if you have an appointment, I have sometimes waited an hour before leaving! -Very limited prescriptions.I feel they offer substandard medications sometimes or are reluctant to prescribe in order to cut costs. I had reactions to a medicine, and they insisted it wasn't the cheap one I was being prescribed. I went home, got a more expensive (and according to online reviews, 3 stars more effective) medicine, and haven't had any problems since. I am also on a really long waiting list to see specialists to get a endoscopy, and on another to see a dermatologist. Both waiting lists are very long and it feels like in the meanwhile, the doctor seriously doesn't care. -no personal relationship with the doctors, so they don't really know you. In a smaller practice you get quite familiar with the staff, and feel a little more like a person and less like an insignificant number. -Very busy practice, sometimes there are no doctors available for a couple of weeks. -Given the the fleeting appointments, often the doctors don't thoroughly check the medical records, and you get a medicine which isn't right for your body, or conflicts with another one you are taking. -Difficult to get on the list if you didn't sign up at the beginning of term. It gets full up quickly. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The hype about the Miso Black Cod is true. Tasty. Melts in the mouth. $23 for it is reasonable. However the Blue Fin toro with caviar is not worth $32. It was good but the price is a little over the top. Check attached photo. I love the sea urchin and eel but then again I really love sea urchin and eel regardless where I eat them. Our waiter is always disappearing. The busser was more attentive than our waiter. The experience was just okay for me I guess. It just makes me appreciate other jap restaurants owned by japanese with japanese waiters more. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This is a decent standby taco place, offering pretty authentic corn tortilla/filling/onions/cilantro tacos of the sort I subsisted on in my home town of Chicago (a town known for its awesome variety of Mexican fare). The service at the counter is quick and friendly, they make good rojo and verde salsas, and everything seems fresh. This is no destination dining experience, but rather is best treated as a taco stand. Grab your tacos and go! ",0,0,1,0,0

 The first time we ordered from here, we were actually impressed with the pizza (being from NY....) The second time was also pretty good. Each and every time after that it's been AWFUL!! I don't know what happened, did they change cooks?, or maybe we were just so pizza deprived that anything tasted good to us...... who knows! I will say though, they have an excellent chicken parm hero (or ""sandwich"", as they call them). ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is one of my favorite sandwich shops to go to. Very clean, everyone greets you with a hello and a smile and need a say FAST? ;) When I'm trying to be good I always get a #4 turkey Tom with no mayo. But who are we kidding? Most days I get a #9 Italian sub with hot peppers. Don't waste your time getting it without, the hot peppers make the sandwich! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I choose to stay at treasure island because of their good prices and a history of winning in their casino. I didn't have time to gamble this trip so I can't attest if that's true. We arrived around 10:30 to check in and the escalator down to the Lobby from self parking was broken. The elevator was around the corner or you could take stairs. There was no line to check in but the girls working the desk were the most boring, in happy I've ever seen in Vegas. We were informed our reserved king room was not available but we could do two queens and move to the king the next day. We opted to stay in the two queens so we didn't have to repack. After reading the previous reviews of being charged for the room twice I brought cash to pay for the room. The lady asked for the booking card and proceeded to charge the balance due on my card. I stopped her and asked if we could pay cash. She looked at me with attitude sighed and said ""you don't want it on the card?"" I said no and we finished the transaction she handed us the room keys and didn't tell us about any of the coupons, where room was located or what our room number was. I had to ask her how to get there and she said around the corner. Our room was non smoking but you could smell the cigarets first thing walking in. The tv sucked, the iron didn't work, moths were flying in from the air vent but everything else was decent. The in room fridge and safe were nice to have. Upon getting ready the first night my shirt got wet from the countertop and there have been some residual clean agent in the counter and it left a bleach stain on my shirt. The crowd in the casino consist of older people, cheap tourist and hookers. The tram to the mirage was broken for our entire stay from Thursday through Monday. Not a big variety of food locations especially for later hours although the 24 Starbucks is nice to have so close. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is not new I had bookmarked it awhile ago but with the business of life I kind of forgot about it but wow am I glad I re found it! I do not hand out 5 stars often but when I do I feel it is well deserved This place is a high class Japanese Tapas. My man suggested coming by for the late happy hour on a night we were out down town on the way home. I pulled up to this not so easy to pull up to place. Trust me if you have to do a turn around please and must do! You walk into a semi light modern designed room, welcomed warmly by the staff not yelled at from across the room. The manager at some point came over and explained the menu and how it is changed sometimes daily. The dishes are highly thought out and prepared with amazing technique. I was so impressed and so happy with our food. We will defiantly be back! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Pretty good for Chinese food in Vegas, which isn't saying much. Over the years I've ordered from here, due to the lack of better options and occasionally their food was pretty good. Before this review I would have given them 3 stars. This review is for my most recent experience. My food arrived cold, which wasn't a huge deal to me it just made the food less appetizing. Then I was eating my soup, pretty decent flavor, but there was plastic in it. It was a small plastic bag right in my soup. I thought it was cabbage, but when I realized it wasn't edible in my mouth I spit it out and noticed it was a small cut bag. So gross! So if you decide to order from here, check your food thoroughly.

 A few friends and I have made our way back to Marty's a few times since the soft opening, and our primary takeaway is this: soooooo expensive. I get that they're independent, that they provide a lot of organic, vegan, specialty foods, but it is just prohibitively expensive, from the produce to the convenience foods to the iced coffee (over $3 for regular iced coffee?). The staff seem nice enough (if a bit slow) and I still love the atmosphere...but the prices? It's a little much. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I made a reservation online before parking. If you made a ""pre registration"" the website shows a $3 per day discount for parking. I registred and recieved an email and a reciept , of which i printed and brought to the lot. When leaving, my rate was at full rate and was told that I needed to print additional pages from the website in order to get the discounted rate. In this case, I wouldnt have pre-registered and would have parked on-site at the airport, as the lots are the same price. Waited approx 25 minutes for the Blue Sky Bus at 11am to pick me up at terminal 2. Travel often and have much better and more convienent service in the Sky Harbor West Lot. ",1,0,0,0,0

 So disappointing! Isn't Bobby Flay famous for his hamburgers?! We checked the menu online before visiting the restaurant. The prices are $3-$4 more than listed online. I ordered the crunchified burger, which the cashier said was the most popular. It was much smaller than the bun, and it wasn't very good. My $4 order of fries was overcooked. I would not recommend this to any of my friends, or visitors to Vegas. What a huge let down. The only positive thing was that the service was great, and everyone was so friendly and helpful.

 Stayed 5 nights 10/29-11/2 in a 1 bedroom suite. We stayed here because we had booked rooms at the Monte Carlo (for almost double the rate) when I got a phone call and was offered a great rate plus comps in exchange for attending a 1.5 hour 'tour of the property' at the same time we were already going to be in Vegas.....cancelled Monte Carlo, hello Hilton! Pros: -Great rate -Comfy bed, lots of pillows -Nice pool area -Friendly, helpful staff (AT HOTEL, not on phone) -Free parking with easy in and outs -Easy taxi service, never waited more than 5 minutes Cons: -Just received a phone call questioning my eligibility for the special rate AFTER our stay. I shut that woman down quick, what was she going to do? Charge me full price AFTER we've left?? Ridiculous, rude and insulting. -Lady who booked my reservation screwed up, had to spend total of 2.5 hours on the phone with these people to get what we needed (what we had originally worked out with the first lady) -'Tour of the property' really means high pressure sales pitch. They act as if you have come there because you already know you want to buy the timeshare (yeah right!) -Room was nice, but I have stayed in much nicer suites, I also toured the penthouse, and it was nothing special...at ALL Overall, I enjoyed my stay and if I was my boyfriend (and didn't have to deal with these annoying, rude booking agents for hours of my life) I would have given it at least 4 stars ",0,1,0,0,0

 There are several people who work here and it seems like when there is a line waiting at the ONE check out they have open by the printer cartridges, it takes a really long time before someone takes notice and opens another register. The person at the check out does not make the effort to notify anyone of a line, the people in the copy section just hang out and chit chat with each other instead of offering to help. Actually the only time I have seen them take someone from the line to help is when told to do so by the manager. You would think a place would pride themselves on customer service but not here and not sure why. Oh well, it here or Staples which actually has cheaper prices on some of the same items. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This review is a little biased as I had the meal comped at a trade show. Accordingly, it was awesome. We were able to splurge and enjoy a full range of antipasti, primi, secondi, contorni & wine. Our bill for seven people came out to $1180, which did include $400+ in wine, so not horrible for a Michelin-caliber restaurant. What's funny is when you walk up to B+B in the Venetian/Palazzo Restaurant Row, the 'Beer & Burgers' aspect of the name stands out, as the facade appears to be little more than a 'nice bar.' We were a bit apprehensive as the host had us wait a few minutes - wait, are we really taking these important clients to a burger bar? - but once we walked inside the restaurant, it had the feel of a upscale comfort venue. Cozy, dark wood set the mood, offset by the white cloth linens and an upbeat serving crew, which included an in-house sommelier. We basically let the service run the show, and they treated us well where we had the best grilled octopus I've tried (absolutely tender; barely charred and so luscious), crispy pork trotter, calimari & seppie fritti, gnocchi, capellacci, country style pate, short rib ""al barolo,"" veal chop & spaghetti with freshly shaved white truffle. For dessert, the marscarpone/blood orange & tiramisu were both standouts. Absolutely delicious meal, good service and nice decor. Very solid meal and highly recommended - especially if you're not footing the bill. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I had been so excited to try this place based on all the great reviews from fellow Yelpers. When the Groupon popped up, we snatched it up. I really wanted to love this place. I have to admit, I was a little (er, a lot) disappointed. We ordered the Prosciutto di Parma e Burrata appetizer to start. This was the highlight of the meal. The dish was good. I ordered the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese. It wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped. I wasn't a big fan of meat sauce. Just a little on the bland side. My fella ordered the Petto di Pollo ai Funghi e Cipolline Borettane all'Agro and felt the same about his dish being a bit bland. My mom got the Lasagnette al Forno, which was probably the best of the three entrees we ordered. The food just felt underseasoned, which is odd for Italian food. As another Yelper noted, the decor is a bit dated and I felt the food prices were on the expensive side for what you get. The service was fantastic. Everyone at this restaurant was so welcoming and friendly. Attentive was the word of the day here. Even as someone who prefers a little anonymity in a restaurant I felt their attention was welcomed. The service definitely outshone the food here, unfortunately. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Starbucks has done 1 thing I'm thankful for. My parents' generation had to deal with cheap diner coffee. Robusto beans which were cheap, high and caffeine, and make awful coffee. Starbucks helped to popularize higher quality beans in this country. That said I am not a fan. I gave up drinking pop 3 years ago. Black coffee is my replacement. That means I need something that has good flavor and is not too bitter. That requires light to medium roast and fresh beans. This location? Or all Starbucks for that matter? Dark roast. Very dark. It is great when you want an espresso drink or something sugary as a desert. But when I just want a plain and tasty coffee in the morning or afternoon? Thanks but most diners these days have better plain coffee. Come here if you want desert or need a pick me up and have no other option. Otherwise, not so much. The staff at this (and most) locations are nice. But it is not quite the experience I remember from even 5-10 years ago. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've been coming here with the work crew for the past 6 years. Over the past two years it's gone from what I would have given 4 stars to just two. My biggest disappointments are: 1. They have recently replaced the big ceramic bowls with smaller metal bowls. 2. They have raised their prices... again. Less food for more money. Normally I would fill a heaping bowl then spend the additional $0.75 to get a to go container. Two meals for the price and I loved it. Great value! Granted, I still leave full, but now I'm paying more for only one meal when I could easily stretch it across two and I don't feel the quality of the meal now is worth the higher prices. I'm done with them. I wouldn't say ""don't go"", but I wouldn't recommend them as I would have several years ago. ",0,1,0,0,0

 After having dinner here I can't say I'm hooked. My wife loved her pasty but I didn't feel the same way about mine. I had the Italian Pasty and there was a good amount of meats like salami, capocollo, pepperoni, ham. It also had mozzarella cheese and came with a side of marinara sauce. The inside of my pasty was really good. I didn't like the ""hot pocket"" type dough so much though. Before my pasty came I grubbed on some Oven Chips with jalapeno. The oven chips were very greasy and somewhat burnt at the same time and I didn't like that the jalapeno easily fell off since there was no cheese or gravy to hold it all together. We were eating with yelper Loon E and his woman and they felt the same way about the oven chips and found their dishes to be too salty. Our waitress was nice and took good care of us. I can't say I'd hurry back next week but since my wife liked her pasty and you can order them for pick up to take home and cook yourself, I might give a different pasty a try. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This store is located in the Walper Hotel in downtown Waterloo. The location is beautiful and in a great location. Upon entering this store I said hello to the attendant who welcome me and I began to look around. The front half of the store had magazines, shaving supplies and some nice pipes in a glass display. The back had a medium sized walk in humidor and another room off to the side that was full of pipes. I went into the humidor and was pleased to see they had some brands and vitolas I haven't seen around elsewhere. But upon inspecting the Bolivars I noticed that several were covered in mould! Not just a spot - covered. Not bloom - mould. Then I saw that the some Montecristos also had mould. And then some H Upmanns! The boxes were from one side of the humidor to the other, on different shelves. When I pointed this out the attendant promptly removed one of each of the cigars. An honest effort but not enough to save the stock. The entire box should have been removed and discarded. I will return to check again soon if the issue has been resolved. The store did have a great selection of pipes though and pipe tobacco in a separate humidor. One attendant seemed knowledgeable - the other did not. I'm not sure how I can rate this store any better. I would never smoke a cigar from there and was completely shocked with what I saw. The attendant made an effort but it was too little. The 1 star is only due to their pipe stock. And by the way, they gave me the wrong box for my pipe, it doesn't fit, and they didn't give me the storage bag for it.... Come on people! Very disappointing. ",1,0,0,0,0

 It was a rainy Sunday morning, and our hunt for breakfast was not turning out so well (loooong waits at other places). We remembered driving by this place, so decided to check it out. We didn't realize it was an actual sit-down restaurant..cool! Our visit started out with some awesome people watching - thanks to the girl wearing last night's make-up, a guy's Dodgers shirt, and nothing else. Our group then decided to order omelettes, because the omelettes also came with a bagel or bialy. This was our mistake - don't go to a bagel place expecting good omelettes, I guess. All of our eggs were extremely over-cooked and not tasy. The Leo omelette (Lox and onions) was pretty much scrambled eggs - not even in an omelette shape. The bagels, however, were very delicious, but not much different from any other bagel I've had. Our server was very efficient, though. All in all, it was a quick and cheap-ish breakfast with some interesting people watching and good service, but overall not good enough to return to. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Wow, I can't believe this place hasn't been a part of my life in the last 4 years. I can't believe I only found it today. And man, oh man, they make great food.

So, I failed as a vegetarian today because all their vegetarian food had mushroom in it and my ethical self flies out the window when mushroom or peas are involved. So, I had pasta with roasted aubergine and sausage. And my god was it delicious.

 This is one of my go-to delivery choices in Champaign. I order from them a lot and my experiences have been a little mixed but for the most part yum-yum-yum satisfaction. Pros: - Most of the food I've ordered from them has been super delicious. Can't speak to authenticity but I sure can speak to how much I enjoy putting it in my mouth. Especially like the chile relleno, the tamales, the salsa*, and anything involving the cheese or ranchero sauces. - Good beverage options. Love the horchata. - Really reasonable prices. For most menu items, the portion sizes are quite large. - Service is really friendly, which matters to me, even if they aren't always perfect. - Open late. Cons: - Sometimes the tortillas on my enchiladas are not very good, kind of stiff and dry. Not sure if they are stale as another reviewer suggested, or overcooked, or if it is something to do with sitting around in the to-go container for too long. The shredded beef and chicken are also not quite up to par with the rest of their food. - Have had occasional issues with service -- communication difficulties, missing complimentary salsa, a weird Campusfood.com-related snafu, trouble finding my easy-to-locate apartment door. All pretty minor and rare though. A note on delivery: all delivery orders come with complimentary chips and salsa, but you get a ton of chips and only a little bit of salsa. You can order extra salsa as a side, though, as well as the cheese sauce. Those two mixed together = heaven. * It's very cilantro-heavy, which I LOVE but I know there are some genetic mutants out there who taste cilantro differently. If you are one, this isn't for you.

 Okay. I have a 74 Honda CB350. Pretty simple to work on..but I don't have the tool or the know how. I take it to him because he is local and very close by to where I live (i.e. free tow). When I bought the old bike in for a tune up he found ALL kinds of things ""wrong"" with it. He charged a TON of money..but thing is..he took FOREVER. Plus..from the first time I brought it home..there were still problems. I had to bring it back there SIX times. SIX! over a 3 month period. It would seem to work for a week then no. Tow. Another week..not..tow. Plus..he sort of J-rigs things. I bought a new part that he asked me to get. It was an original rectifier. His wiring I guess made it not work..AND he destroyed it in the process and used one from his scrap yard. The last time I went (and I swore I wouldn't) I just needed a spark plug cable replaced. He didn't use a new cable but spliced an old one AND for some reason found that I needed a new ignition coil (though bike was working fine before some jerk cut my cable). He fixed it in two days...I drove off..nope..no horsepower. He kept it another 9 days! Drove off..no horsepower. Said it was ready when he didn't even test it. I turn right around. He's all ""I don't know, I don't know"" and sorta making me feel like it somehow is my fault. I asked..is there gas in it (I came there with 3/4 of a tank). OH OH no gas! Yeah, because you drained the gas to do whatever you were doing. His helper starts filling it up and I'm like..it need s bit more. He says ""Not with gas prices these days"". Um..I brought it here almost full. Anyway...I like to give locals business but now there's some mysterious rattle, I dropped way more money than expected again, and it took forever as it's my main transport. Never..ever..again.

 My doctor was nice enough but overall the policy of the office is garbage. I was told to bring in my medical records from my prior PCP. They were never scanned and my doctor NEVER even looked at them. This means every time I go in to see the doctor, it's like being a new patient. What should be a 30 minute appointment takes 3 hours AND I leave with NOTHING. No prescriptions, no plan of action, nothing. A year later, same thing.

 Hope you like meat, because that's really what it's all about here! Leave your little coaster on green light, and let the feast begin! Waiters bring out skewers of different choices of meat from sirloin, flank steak, bacon wrapped chicken, pork ribs, filet mignon, and parmesan crusted pork. Yes, there is a salad bar, of which i felt like I had to balance out my meal, but not the highlight. All of the staff bringing out the skewers was overwhelming at first. I was like can I finish chewing first before you bring out more???? But who was I to say no to more succulent cuts of beef, and ribs, and more beef! My only ""beef"" hahaha, was that once the staff saw that our party of 12 was slowly putting out their red stop signs, they pretty much stopped entirely while there were a few of us carnivores that were still chowing down. We had to ask for the filet mignon and the parmesean crusted pork, and even then they brought out one piece of the pork. C'mon mannnnn! Gimmee mo' meat! The staff handled our large group well, and even brought out a complimentary order of flan for the guest of honor, which was better than I was expecting since I'm not a big fan of flan. I will be on the look out for more of Fogo de Chao and other Brazilian steakhouses when I'm on a meat binge. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Food: Very good restaurant. I actually came here for the Kabob (Persian food). It was really good, the meat is very tender and flavorful. Service: The owners and servers are all so sweet. Pricing: It was a little more expensive than I'm used to, about $10 for the dish. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Where do I start... I recently had some really good Pork Bulgogi in Toronto that was AMAZING, so I found La Maison Bulgogi in Montreal and decided to try it. What a disappointment, it was bland and the portion was small. We also some chicken wings that were decent but overall AVOID AT ALL COST.... The decor was gross, tables are some sort of weird tables that your legs do not fit under. The price was very high for what you actually get. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Awesome food! Hands down the best Italian deli in AZ Just a note - the owner solicits for tips but the employees never see any of the tips. Have always tipped 40-50% of my tab & a little upset about it now because I believed the employees serving me were actually receiving the $ at the end of their shift. Not the case. I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the owner soliciting for tips for his profit. Not cool :-| ",0,0,1,0,0

 A group of us went for Happy Hour before the big performance at ASU Gammage. We all sat in the back patio area. They sure have an excellent water mist system to cool off. You might get a little wet if stayed too long in one area. Hey, who complaining when it's 100+! I had ordered the Southwest Smoked Turkey Brat with sweet peppers and caramelized onions. It was spicy yet so good you can't stop eating it. The PEACH TANDEM must try! A well balance of beer and cocktail. It's a great hangout spot. Good food, beer/wine selection & great service.

 I've been a fan of MAC for years eventhough I don't wear make-up all the time. They have the best shades of lipstick, blush and eyeshadow. Their brushes last a long time. Their foundation and powders aren't cakey at all and don't irritate my skin. The ladies that work at MAC anywhere are really helpful. My last experience was at this location inside Fashion Show Mall. There's a shade of lipstick that I've been looking for for a long time since I lost it when I was traveling. To make my search more challenging, I couldn't remember the name of the color. The lady behind the counter was extremely patient with me. She showed me different shades of lipstick, blurted out names that might ring a bell. Then she brought me to a part of the store and there it was...the right pink lipstick I've been looking for! *angels singing and a bright light shining upon THE ONE* I was soooo happy! Thank you for being patient with the-most-difficult-customer-of-the-day! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I have been to Tigerlilly plenty of times for cocktails but this was the first visit for food. It is my mother in laws birthday and I thought that this would be a great treat out. I bought a voucher from ITISON for the afternoon tea for \ u00a322 instead of \ u00a346 per couple. This included a tea pot of cocktail of Michael Collins gin cocktail. I had requested a booth but after dropping off my in laws and husband at the door and parking the car, by the time I got into the restaurant they were already seated at a regular table, but actually it was a nice table and there was nobody seated either side so it did feel roomy enough. Great sandwiches and cakes and a nice selection of speciality teas too, I had strawberry and cream tea which was lovely. The scones were a little dry and if I am being uber picky, I would have liked the option of butter too as well as the cream and jam. The afternoon was a great hit with the birthday girl and we headed to the cinema all hyper from the sweet treats we had. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Made the mistake of not reading the accurate reviews of the shady business practices. I have rented cars literally over a hundred times and this is by far the most fraudulent shady business location I have ever encountered in the world. The first hint that something is shady is that they spent an exorbitant amount of time trying to get you to buy their insurance and come up with all these crazy reasons you need it which other car companies will gladly assist you with. They say you have to pay for an old battery that goes dead, you have to pay for a a damaged tire, etc regardless if it was your fault or not. I have never heard of such nickel and diming. They also heavily emphasize that you have to pay for any repair time. The real problem is when you return the car the person inspecting the car is guaranteed to find something wrong with the car, even tiny things like a tiny chip in the window or paint chipped off or small dents, etc. They will find something and they will make you pay dearly. I am sure they get a bonus for writing down any possible damage on the car. I am sure after they collect the additional money from you they spend absolutely none of it to fix the car so they can blame the next person for the damages and so on and so on so everybody pays for the damages from the customer from 50 rentals previous. This is how they make their money. Whatever enjoyment you got from your trip to Vegas will be completely obliterated when you have to deal with Budget when you return the car. This is beyond a classless business. You have been warned. Read all of the reviews both recommended and not recommended. The Reviews not recommended will support all of the recommended reviews. Avis, Alamo in my opinion are the best, never once was I nickel and dimed and fraudulently schemed like at Budget. Enterprise and Hertz are ok but their cars aren't the greatest and sometimes they are damaged but they will not try to make sure you are to blame from a previous renter's damage like this Budget place will do. Although other Budget places may not have such shady practices, Las Vegas Budget is by far the seediest. I don't know if this is their business model as the best and easiest way to make money off of their customers, but I will never rent from them again. Shame on me for getting scammed this time. I would be a total foolish moronic idiot to ever rent from here again. Negative stars would be a more accurate portrayal. This place just makes my blood boil. Disclaimer: I am actually being nice in this review. I would rather say a whole bunch of expletives on how awful this experience was. Whoever defends this place obviously works for them or is related to somebody who is a manager here. I wouldn't be surprised if all of the positive reviews come from employees and managers here. I do not see how anybody could have a pleasant experience here. They probably will treat you a little better if you bought all of their expensive extra insurance and were paying full price with no discount. You are warned. ",1,0,0,0,0

 First the good: Great service and a cool room. I like how the restaurant is on a different level from the casino floor. Now the bad, the food is terrible. I had the Sea bass, it was over cooked and too salty, and send it back. My wife had the NY strip, I ordered one to replace my fish. They were not cooked evenly, and were a little dry. I know steak houses use a laser to check temperature. If your job is working the grill in a steakhouse, you should be able to cook a perfect steak be sight and touch. Come on, in a restaurant in Aria charging $50/ entree, I shouldn't be complaining about the preparation of our meal. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Sadly, I much prefer the Chompies in Chandler, AZ over the Scottsdale location. Having been to Scottsdale one three times and all three I have been let down but none more than today. Breakfast on Saturday at 10:30 AM. and surprisingly, or maybe not, we got a table for two immediately. Ray was our server and he immediately appeared with water and a very cheerful attitude. The menu here has A LOT to look at so we stated our drinks and he said he would return soon. After 15 minutes, he did return to take our order. Now maybe because my husband was looking at the menu the whole time but not to pick anything only to kill time. Ray walked past us several times in this 15 minutes (OK, I exaggerate, it was only 12 minutes) and never once looked at us to see if we were ready. Only when I asked for some help, did Ray return. I ordered the Fiesta Omelet. Bad choice. This was a pile of messy scrambled eggs with some black beans. I specifically ordered no onions or sour cream and got the no sour cream part but it was slathered in onions. Also, the menu states it comes topped with ranchero sauce and cheese and avocado - none of these items were found on the plate. I did ask for avocado and Ray stated, ""Oh, does it come with avocado?"" The meal was tasteless and after my annoyance of no cheese, hard to enjoy. We were ready to check out and again, I had to go get Ray and ask for our check. Usually, or it has been in the last several visits to Chompies, a manager stops by to see if all is OK. This time - nope. Not one because I would have stated the problem. Oh well... I'll just stick to the Chandler location now and won't order that omelet again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Came here today for a late lunch to check off another burger place off my list. Now I'll start off with having a really nice server and a really nice, if blue, atmosphere. I had decided to ride my bike there today, to work off the burger pounds I'm probably putting on, and they let me take it inside. The place was mostly empty, but still a really nice gesture so I didn't have to leave my really expensive bike outside. They filled up my water really fast as well and were very attentive. Strange thing was that I seemed to get served by 2 people, so they both asked me the same things one after another. I ordered the blu burger ($12) and can say that it could be a lot better for the price. The toppings of onion, bacon and Gorgonzola cheese were really tasty and savory. Mine didn't come with an onion bun that I could tell but still was a really nice bun to eat. I think that bun might be the best one I've had so far during my burger adventures. Unfortunately, the meat patty was extremely underwhelming. I don't know why they bothered asking me how I want my patty done (medium) because the thin ~1/4"" patty was well done yet still lukewarm. There wasn't much texture to it either. These things are really expensive too! Usually this price will get you a burger and fries at least, but it costs something like $5 for fries. That's the price of a burger and fries at some other places. I'd be curious to try their kobe patty to see if it was any better, but probably not anytime soon. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The Bellagio Pool Cafe is delicious but expensive... under a nice covered area, you can enjoy a wide variety of lunch options in your swimsuit and towel. By the time we sat down around 2:30 pm, I was starving so I ended up sampling everyone else's food in addition to my own. I had the teriyaki chicken lettuce wraps ($12.50) that came with cold noodles, pickled, veggies, and hoisen sauce. They were really yummy and a good amount of food. My uncle enjoyed the Cobb salad (about $14) that included fresh tomatoes (red and yellow), delicious avocado, etc. My brother and dad shared a tuna sandwich and a turkey sandwich with fries and cole slaw. Everyone appreciated their lunch selections and left the Cafe satisfied and happy. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Since moving to Las Vegas, I think I appreciate Target even more!

 This is not a ""Hilton"" hotel. It was sold a few years ago and the ""Hilton"" company has been trying to get their name off of it. I have stayed at a few ""Hilton's"" over the years and many casinos in Vegas but had never stayed here before but my wife and I wanted to try something new. Apparently they don't believe in customer service at the LVH. Maybe they didn't know that there is competition for travelers in Vegas? They were rude from the moment we checked in until the moment we left. The people at the front desk, the woman at the players club desk, even at the coffee shop acted like they wanted nothing to do with us. So rude and uninterested in speaking to us. My wife and I made it a point not to spend a penny here. We saw shows at Ceasars Palace, and New York New York, ate at Paris, Mandalay Bay, The Flamingo, and Terribles casino. We spent quite a bit over the last 3 days but not one penny at the LVH. The room was nothing special. I've stayed at 6 different casinos now and would rate the quality of the room in the middle. Nothing exceptional, nothing horrible about the room itself. When I've stayed at the Hilton in San Francisco they always treated me with such respect, the other casinos in Vegas made us feel welcome. I would rather get a $20 room at the Palace Station than go back to the LVH. I would rather spend a lot more at a casino that I enjoy being at then put one more penny in the pockets of the staff at LVH. The management clearly is not doing their job if their employees are allowed to treat guests like they do. When you are on vacation you want the people at your resort/hotel to be welcoming, not act like you are bothering them, they are tired and don't want to see any more guests. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I really enjoyed our meal here! It's expensive but worth it. This place gets a 4.5/5. We wanted to try a fine dining experience and I am glad that we chose this restaurant. We ordered a few things to share. What was really thoughtful and a great idea was that the kitchen prepared everything as separate portions so that we didn't need to divide the dishes ourselves. Service 5/5 Service was excellent! There was a lot of staff, but they all had a purpose. There was one person just refilling everyone's water, another clearing table, and folding napkins. I did sometimes seem to get real busy with so many staff. The sommelier came over to the table to ask what we were eating and recommend a wine. This was another great touch! The manager was also walking around making sure that everyone was enjoying themselves. The atmosphere had a good vibe to it. We came here on a Wednesday night and the place was very busy. Everyone around us seemed to be having a great time. Food 4.5/5 Our waiter was friendly, and we got a brief tutorial on the different cuts and types of steak the restaurant serves. Having the steak cut examples as a visual, really helped. This is one of the few restaurants I've been to that does this. We got some free bread to start off the meal, which was great. For appetizers ordered the Hamachi Crudo. This was delicious light and delicate, the garlic puree was not overpowering. The Hamachi was soft and melted in your mouth. My boyfriend who usually dislikes garlic loved this dish. We also had to potato and octopus salad. The dish was nicely balanced and I really enjoyed the potatoes and vinaigrette. The appetizers were delicious. For mains we ordered the American Rib Cap. The steak was well cooked, and tender, and the marbling on the beef gave it a fatty richness to the steak; however I thought it was way too salty for me. This was the only dish that I didn't enjoy as much. We got the beef wellington and it was yummy and AMAZING! The pastry was light and crispy, and the steak was tender and juicy. The vegetables and the potato puree were tasty. They helped cut the richness of the wellington, worked well with the meat. I loved the red wine demi-glace. I can see why this dish is Gordon's signature dish, it was lovely. They served both mains at the same time, which was great however by the time we finished the beef wellington the rib cap had gotten a bit cold. Sadly I was too full to try any of the desserts. Overall we had lovely experience here. We had a couple of disappointing meals before this and I am glad this lived up to expectations. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This was our only evening in Madison, so we wanted to go to the BEST Restaurant and we heard that L'Etoile was the place to go. ....and we are so thrilled that our first and only evening in Madison was spent at this amazing restaurant. L'Etoile should be a Michelin Star in my opinion!! Service was impeccable. Food was divine. We had the House Charcuterie first which was unbelievable, I highly recommend starting with this. The wine pairing was so generous each course, the Sommelier paired each wine so perfectly with every dish and it was fun having to taste a variety of wine. The place is beautiful right in the heart of the Capitol Square. The Building is architecturally a work of art, all made of glass. Our table was perfectly situated, great view of the square. Our server, Kenzie was quite pleasant. She made our evening extra special. We hope to be back in Madison very soon. One evening here is surely not enough. ",0,0,0,0,1

 As simply put, mediocre at best. There was so much hype about this place and even had to wait 15 minutes. Why wait 15 minutes when you can get virtually the same thing if not better at other breakfast places? On top of that, my waitress was very slow to serve us. My friend, girlfriend, and I had already chosen what we desired yet, we waited an additional 10-15 minutes. It was busy but there's no excuse for waiting that long. I got the corned beef hash which was not that well cooked and the hash was shredded way too excessively. It was almost as if I'm tasting carnitas. On top of that was scrambled eggs, which there is nothing bad you can say about standard scrambled eggs. The potatoes were actually quite good. They had some kind of salt and spice that was addicting. But there's a problem when the side tastes better than the main dish. Overall, mediocre food, below average service. Would not consider this an option for breakfast brunch. I would rather starve and wait for lunch if I had to. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'd heard great things, decided to take my mom and sister for dinner before taking them to the airport. Booked through OpenTable for 8:30 August 9th, and got there 8:25pm. Waited a min or two and we were seated in an area that had prob a party of 16, so our table was by itself at the other end. Which we thought would make it nice and quiet. Waited a good bit to order bottled water. We had to ask the girl that wasn't our server to send our server by, we had plenty of time to decide on our order as we waited. I order the reg filet medium and my mom and sister both got the petite filet medium well. Also a few sides. Honestly I thought the prices were great, not the typical bloated a la carte prices. The place had the a/c blasted and it got cold, and I'm a guy I love the a/c but was freezing. We waited and waited... The large group finally got their food and our server said ours would be out next. Maybe the group put everyone's orders back a while. When it finally got to us it had been 70 minutes from the time of our reservation!!! As the food runner was placing the filets I couldn't tell the difference in the sizes (our server later said the petite is 6oz and the reg is 8oz pretty small in my book) I cut into mine and took a few bites and it was not medium. My mom and sisters were not medium well but theirs looked medium. Our server took her time checking on us and I showed her that mine was not medium which she agreed. She said she would talk to the chef, I said if I can be out quickly I would like a new one. She came back and said the chef told her he could make it butterfly style and have it some in 6 minutes. I said fine. Interestingly I went out with some friends a while back and we made fun of one of the guys for ordering a filet butterfly style. The filet came out and it was fine. I enjoyed it, just not the hassle. Then we were thinking of getting desserts but again waited quite a while and finally asked the other girl again and she brought the menus. Our server finally came out and we said if they dessert was quick we could do it, again we were going straight the the airport from here. It came out and it was good as well. Anyway she comp'd the dessert (of course that was the least I would expect). Total was $126 and I still tipped $20 even though I honestly shouldn't have. If I had the time I would've asked for the manager. Figured I'd email the manager later when I have time. Guess what no email or direct contact info! Since I recently moved from Summerlin to Mtn's Edge I was thinking this would be a new regular steakhouse for my wife and I, prob not! ",0,1,0,0,0

 In November I bought a Blackberry Playbook and was so happy that I could use it for work in conjunction with my blackberry! I used it for a couple weeks and was frustrated that I could not get it to bridge to my black berry. Then I was out of town and it was working fine and then in the middle of the day it just died. I figured I might have left it on and the battery died. Later when I got back to the hotel and tired to charge it, it would not charge. This went on for a few days, not understanding why I could not charge it. Frustrated that I spent weeks now moving all my data to the device and was out of town and kind of held hostage work wise, I then called the RIM customer service when I returned home. After explaining the issue, we determined the charger was faulty. The customer service rep instructed me to go to Future Shop/Best Buy and find a changer and see if the device takes the charge and if it does to call them back from the store and they would advise me what to do. I left my condo and did as requested. About and hour later I called them and they were puzzled as to why I was given such an instruction and apologized for the inconvenience, and advised me they would replace the charger and send it right away. They also advised me I could use my BlackBerry charger to at least change the device until the stronger charger arrives. That was 18 days ago and yesterday I finally received the replacement charger. During this 18 days, I received 3 emails from RIM indicating that the charger is being shipped, then an email indicating the tracking number but provided no shipper info......the whole process was very unprofessional. Love the playbook, (which is now bridged to my blackberry), but do not feel the customer service for RIM is very responsive. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Looked at reviews on Yelp & decided to stop in. We were promptly seated & were asked what we wanted to drink. After a quick browse through the menu, we settled on the Eggplant Parmesan, the Baked Rigattoni with chicken, & the Cheese Ravioli with the tomato cream sauce. All of these meals came with an antipasto salad and bread. The food came came out in a pretty quick amount of time. Everything was good. The Eggplant Parm tastes a little bit off ... I think because it was slightly undercooked. The sauce it was covered in was pretty good, however. The Baked Rigattoni was kind of the same way - the garlic sauce with the chunky tomatoes tasted good but I was not impressed with the chicken. It was tasteless & could have been left off. Lastly, the Cheese Ravioli was good as was the tomato cream sauce, however it confused me as to why there was an additional cost associated with it. As far as the restaurant itself - it is very much a family place & has that atmosphere. The decor is very outdated. I'm undecided as to whether or not I'll be back. It was good .. Just not exciting enough to go back. Not anytime soon anyway. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I love, love, love, love, love the Encore. The first time I went was soon after it opened and my boyfriend treated me to a romantic weekend (which turned into a week, but that's another story). We stayed in a regular suite as there were no rooms available in the Tower, and that was alright. Upon arrival we couldn't find a luggage valet to save our lives, which bothered me greatly, and check in was very slow, but the room was quite nice for a standard room. Very comfortable and I was expecting lots of red, as per the casino floor, but it was all very muted-chic. I wasn't so much a fan of the television mid-room; it was impossible for someone to sleep and the other to watch television without a snarl or two ;) A few days later we moved to the Tower suites (and have since never gone back to the regular suites, some 4 visits later). We stayed in a Parlor suite, and it is decadent - perhaps not quite to the extreme I was expecting (coming from Skylofts at MGM, nothing is quite as decadent as you'd hoped, I think) but gorgeous nonetheless. The suite is enormous, the bed soft and comfortable, everything very new and shiny. I LOVE the bathroom in the Parlor Suite - huge and gorgeous. I'm not a fan of their Bambu product line, but whatever, small things. Encore, as a whole, is over the top and very, very rich-feeling. This is my favorite casino in Vegas and although I hate to admit it we've gotten to know the craps dealers awfully well. Really great people who are lots of fun. Encore staff, I have found, are very personable. The decor is not for everyone, but I find it awfully inviting after coming from the dimly lit, dingy casinos elsewhere on the Strip. Love the personalized Red Cards (which are also your hotel room key). XS Nightclub - best club in Vegas. Pure is over. Sorry. Goes with the rest of the Encore theme - rich, decadent, over the top, and SO COOL. Service A+; I had a craving for a Bloody Mary and some poor barback went and fetched me one from the casino. Needless to say he got tipped awfully well at night's end. The Spa at Encore is INSANE... go see it, if only to look around. It's BEAUTIFUL, opulent, magnificent, astonishing. Easily my favorite spa in Vegas, with the exception of a Four Seasons Essence of the Glaciers facial (or whatever they call it). The services are wonderful, technicians well studied and professional, and there are beautiful pools and sitting areas in the spa. They have these amazing heated stone loungers near one of the small pools that invite you in and then put you to sleep. I've never been so comfortable in a public(ish) area before. Cannot wait to stay here again. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Gaspar was lovely! We escaped there for supper with our toddler after a less-than-sterling time at Pub-St.-Paul as part of a large gathering, and it soothed us into recognizing that we had, indeed, found the quality Quebecois fare that we had sought. My steak frites were lovely, with meat that was a perfect medium-rare. My husband attempted to order his burger medium-rare, but was informed that the burgers only come medium-well, and that this is the case within all of Canada. Now, I can respect a restaurant that is sufficiently confident in their dishes to only serve them in the way that they were designed to be served, but we did both think that the the burger would have been tastier medium-rare. The pork belly was a nice addition. Our server was very friendly and accommodating, which is hugely gratifying when traveling with a toddler. We felt completely at ease eating with him there, which we weren't at first certain would be the case given the menu and decor. We felt welcomed and valued, and appreciated the warm smiles from other staff as well. We're thinking about heading back up to Montreal in the spring or summer, with the aim of hitting a number of amazing-sounding eateries that we didn't try the first time. Other than Au Pied de Cochon, which would be the main reason for the trip, Taverne Gaspar is probably the only place we visited this time that we'd give a second try on a very limited engagement, thus giving up the opportunity to try someplace new for that meal. It has definitely earned a return visit. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Not bad pizza but not the best. It's pretty expensive which is understandable since this is the Las Vegas strip but if you need a late night slice of pie it will do the trick. If your looking for something to stand out or taste like a top notch pizza joint you may want to search around a little bit more. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Ate here with my family for Christmas dinner, the wait was immense and the crowd was huge. The prices were kind of high, but it was the only place open.. so we stuck around. My daughter ordered the House Special (shrimp, pork, chicken) lo mein, which she really liked. My partner ordered some kind of beef and onion pancake thing which looked like beef fajitas and tortillas- she really liked it. I ordered tofu and mixed vegetables, which was okay. I would return for lunch specials, especially since it's close to my job. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The crowd has a lot of undesirables and rift-raft. I dont want/need uber exclusive but its nice to go out to a nightclub where at least people look the part. My GF commented that the guys were super ugly. Even the bouncers sort of the looked goofy and academic. Forget about what people looked like, they were basically a lot of wierdo's. Perhaps I stopped by on a off night, but it I would have to agree that the crowd was not attractive. If your gonna go out, might as well choose a place that has a sexy crowd. otherwise why deal with the headaches, might as well have a fun night at O-Shea's ",1,0,0,0,0

 Oh, El Cortez, I love you! First of all, my parents met when they both worked here (I think? Something like that...) so I might have the place to thank for my very existence. That aside.... It's kinda gross. It's old, it hasn't been renovated in a long time, and it shows. It's hard to get around. The parking garage is messed up beyond belief (but it's a great place to park downtown for free and avoid the big red thing...shh, it's a secret). I wouldn't stay here unless I was fueled by a bottle of whisky or some very, very dire circumstances and I wouldn't eat here if you paid me to. All of which make the El Cortez AWESOME. This is real downtown. This is the downtown I know and love. It's gritty and it's dirty and it's unapologetic, which is exactly what an unabashedly sinful den of gambling, booze and free silk jackets (thanks, Jackie!) should be. Playing the $5 blackjack tables here on a Friday night/Saturday morning is utterly delightful, and I've never won a single dime doing it. There is a door facing Fremont that is half the width of regular doors. There seems to be no rhyme or reason for the existence of this tiny door, but there it is, bein' tiny. The whole place is just absolutely surreal. If you're into that, just walk in and give the ol' El a twirl. ",0,0,0,1,0

 When you think about it, this is every sports bar in the city, or state. Maybe even the country. It's divey, it's sporty, it's an old man bar, it's where guys come without the wives to get away, it's loud, and it has an okay menu. This place has that sports bar menu, with wings, burgers, fries, sandwiches, steaks, and some pretty decent daily specials. I had a vegetarian ""grilled cheese"" which disappointingly was more like a quesadilla rather than the grilled cheese it was advertised as. Strike one (well this is a sports bar). Strike two? I I ordered a Diet Pepsi as a drink. The DP tasted like it was made with really bad water! No filtration system? Terrible! Back to the quesadilla, er, grilled cheese, er, screw it, this was a quesadilla. It was hard to find the advertised veggies. Very little spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, and I never even saw the roasted red peppers. So, being a sports bar I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the food was sub par, and falsely advertised as a grilled cheese (you have to know when your mind is set for a grilled cheese, nothing else will do!). Oh, and strike three was when someone put money in the jukebox, the sound overrides the advertised big screens all over the bar area so whatever sports is on, you can't listen to the announcers. Big time disappointing place. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Well, this show is half magic & half dance. The costumes are really cool, takes you back to a similar feel from the movie Wild Wild West with Will Smith. I'm not really into magic, but there were 2 illusions that were pretty cool. The two magicians are older cheesy men who don't talk, which is nice. One of them, attempted to do some acrobatic cirque flying through the air on scarves thing, it looked really bad & you could tell he just learned how to do it. I felt bad for him. In the introduction, a dancer talks about Steampunk & that's what the show is about, the show really has nothing to do with it: ""Steampunk is a sub-genre of science fiction, alternate history, and speculative fiction that came into prominence during the 1980s and early 1990s.[1] Specifically, steampunk involves an era or world where steam power is still widely used--usually the 19th century and often Victorian era Britain--that incorporates prominent elements of either science fiction or fantasy. Works of steampunk often feature anachronistic technology or futuristic innovations as Victorians may have envisioned them; in other words, based on a Victorian perspective on fashion, culture, architectural style, art, etc. This technology may include such fictional machines as those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne or real technologies like the computer but developed earlier in an alternate history."" The only steam in the show was prior to the performance a few squirts of steam on the stage before the show started & the costumes were of this era. I think it had potential to be pretty cool, but it didn't go where I thought it would. I would give it a 6/10 & will most likely not recommend it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The first thing you'll notice when you walk in are the two glass cases full of beautifully decorated old-school donuts. To be fair, that's probably all you'll pay attention to at any donut shop, but the variety here is pretty extensive. Regular and ""inverted"" cinnamon rolls (they kind of resemble brains), classic and cake donuts a plenty, sprinkle- and frosting-topped versions for purists, and ""fancies"" like maple bars (no bacon here!), buttermilk bars (a surprise hit!), giant bear claws, and eclairs. Anything with fruit is generally really well done here, too. I'm not even really much of a donut fan, but this place gets an extra star for not pulling that cash-only BS that other places do.

 Start off by saying WOW! I get great sushi in Cali at a high price. I had The all you can eat sushi $21.95 for Lunch with my friend. The place looked mediocre outside but stepping inside the staff was very friendly and made me feel right at home. Everyone greeted us with smiles and then came the menu. Plain and simple but as I ordered and started to get the rolls and nigiri I realized this is now my new sushi home. Everything was delicious and made just right. I thought this level of sushi couldn't be found with all you can eat sushi at only $21.95. I was wrong. They asked me if I like spicy and of course I do. They offer two rolls 911 and Ninja roll with different levels of spice. 1 through 10 is what our server said we ordered 7 to be on the safe side of each roll. To my surprise they were delicious and very spicy made me sweat. Next time I might try the level 10. This is my new home for sushi I'm so glad is literally across the street from me.

 This place is great. Classy, chill, centrally located and open late. The service was terrific, the pizza margherita was wonderful and the drinks were stiff without being obnoxious. I had the pomegranate julep and the $5 gin martini, both great. If you're by yourself, you will feel comfortable here. This is so not a meat market. It's not a cafe, but it's also not a skeezy bar. I did dock one star for the guy who ""greeted"" me when I walked in. I was by myself, not looking terribly put together, with a backpack and casual clothes. He didn't seem too hyped to seat me and that left a bad taste in my mouth, until the very sweet server (Jeanett, I think) took over. Then it was all good from there.

 Yoga flow is a small studio located on Walnut Street. It's heated Vinyasa flow yoga. If you're a beginner, I suggest going to the beginners class or to a community class, which are slower and more instructive than the all levels classes. The studio is inviting and friendly, they have mats you can rent and free towels and blocks. The prices are reasonable ($9 for drop in, $7 for students). Saturday morning classes can be crowded, but I've always had enough room. I highly recommend this studio! Take Jesse's 6:15am class and you will feel amazing after. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I am not a fan of the Epicentre where this place is located. It is chock full of themed restaurants that are probably owned by the same company kind of like in an airport. Chaotic and not fun, and this is one of the many cookie cutter places in the joint. I'm guessing BlackFinn is a chain. The place is so loud and hard to even think, even if you are in the dining room. The food, however, is pretty good. I had a seared ahi tuna salad and it was delicious. The tuna was good, albeit light in the serving. I would be surprised if it were 3 ounces. I did like the flavor. I also liked the broccoli, which was steamed and nice. However, the wine list was awful. The same wines are available across the Epicentre in the 24 hour CVS. For example, Menage a Trois is $8.99 in every CVS and gas station in the country, and they are selling it there for $8 a glass. Plus they have Sutter Home White Zinfandel which they sell by the single serving in Penn Station for desperate passengers boarding Long Island Railroad after a long week. I really didn't see much I liked at all. Anyway, the food was good. The environment was noisy and not fun or anything special. The wine was terrible. The service was pretty good.

 Having had type 1 diabetes for 24 years, I am used to having yearly eye exams to screen for retinopathy and prevent blindness. Normally I go to Vision Works or Lenscrafters, and their ophthalmologists have referred me to vitreoretinal surgeons if they felt it was necessary. But after my last endocrinologist visit, my doctor referred me to the Eye and Ear Institute because he thought they would offer me the best care. When I scheduled my appointment, I specified I needed to have my eyes dilated to check for retinopathy, as well as be fitted for contact lenses. I also mentioned I had 2 laser surgeries in each eye to correct retinopathy, and dilation was necessary for my type 1 care. I let the appointment-scheduler know my endocrinologist wanted me to see Dr. Yu, but was told she does not perform routine eye exams. I was then told eye dilation was routine during a ""diabetic eye exam,"" and was scheduled to see Dr. Sundar-Raj. Since I felt the appointment-setter was knowledgeable, I didn't think to check Dr. Sundar-Raj's credentials before my appointment-- my fault I suppose. Anyway, since I'm always extremely nervous before and during my eye exams (potential blindness from an incurable disease will do that to a person), and dilation prevents me from driving (I know some people can just wear sunglasses but they have never helped me), my fiance and I both took a vacation day from work so he could act as my chauffeur. Too bad we didn't use the day for something more enjoyable or productive! The morning of my appointment, I was contacted by Kathy from the Eye and Ear Institute (I'm almost positive that was her name, but the more I think of it, I may be incorrect). She was extremely polite and genuine, and let me know my insurance did not include eye exams. Because of my type 1, this ""confusion"" happens often, and I explained how even though my general eye exam for glasses and contact lenses is not covered, eye dilation for retinopathy is considered medically necessary and covered by my insurance. She seemed to understand that was typical during a ""diabetic eye exam"" and was extremely polite. Once I arrived I checked-in with Danielle. She was also ""confused"" by my insurance, and kept asking me questions about why I needed a ""diabetic eye exam."" I explained to her what I told Kathy, and she kept cutting me off as if she knew my situation better than me. She was CLEARLY confused, and when I tried to show empathy by stating ""I know it's confusing..."" She cut me off and said ""It's NOT CONFUSING!"" She then continued to talk down to me as if I were a child, and made fun of me for choosing my name as my email address. I then went into the back with a tech who was nice, but assumed I was just diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. She asked why I needed an appointment, and thought it was my first eye exam. Even though she was nice, I was extremely confused since I had stated my medical history repeatedly. I then was left in a waiting room to see Dr. Sundar-Raj, but was shocked because my eyes were not dilated. When I finally saw Dr. Sundar-Raj, he seemed confused that I was seeing him and asked if I had ever had my eyes dilated. He then said he did not have experience with retinopathy and wanted me to see a retina specialist, even though he could do a ""diabetic eye exam."" Although he updated my prescription for glasses, he wanted me to see him in 10 days to finalize my contact lens prescription even though he gave me the wrong brand of contact lenses for my 10 day trial. However, he did seem concerned when I told him I scheduled a true ""diabetic eye exam"" to check my retinas that day, but asked if I still wanted contact lenses. I said I did, and he sent me to check-out and make another appointment for a retina specialist at the desk. I then checked out with Kathy, who was genuinely concerned with my situation. She tried to find any coverage for my appointment, and another nice lady tried to find a way to offer me a fee-waiver. It was $79 for a worthless eye exam, and I could've had contacts, a prescription, free parking, and a retinopathy check for half the cost at Vision Works. I also wouldn't have wasted a day off of work. The 1 star goes to Kathy, who really deserves 10, for helping me set an appointment with a retina specialist in Mckeesport. Now I need another day off for eye dilation, so I think UPMC owes me and my fiance at least 1 day's pay! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Very disappointing. The staff is great and very knowledgable and they provided excellent service. They deserve to be serving better food to their customers. We started off with the grilled octopus appetizer and it was delicious but the portion was just a little small. Unfortunately that was the high point of the food. We ordered the spaghetti with lobster for our ""primo"" portion and I like my pasta al dente but this was so raw it was crunchy and the lobster was very tough and chewy. For our ""secondi"" portion I ordered the veal chop and my girlfriend ordered the NY Strip. We ordered medium rare as per the ""chef's"" suggestion but what we were served was so rare that our plates were practically mooing! Sent the meat back to be cooked a little longer and I believe all they did was take a hand held blow torch to our meals because the meat came back with very odd color that normally wouldn't be caused by a regular broiler. The servers were very accommodating and we did appreciate their efforts to try to make our meal experience better. But definitely not worth the $260.00 that the meal cost. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Okay, I'm biased because I'm actually German. And in Germany I'd probably never set a foot into a traditionally designed beer house - just because I'm from Berlin and this is more stuff Bavarians would do. But I was in Pittsburgh so different rules. Came here for brunch on a Sunday because of an invite. You're not a member? Sorry no entry. Luckily, my accent gave it away and apparently Germans are always welcome. They serve proper Bavarian food - Wurst, Bacon (?), Red Cabbage, fried potatoes - pretty solid. You can also get omelettes together with a Krug of German beer. Is that what we Germans do for breakfast back home? Maybe in the Bavarian woods, I'm not sure, but it is definitely something. The interior is quite unique - imagine Oktoberfest in 1935 and you get the idea. Fun fact: not everyone in there speaks German and they have waitresses that work there for over a decade. I do, however, appreciate that this Pittsburgh institution is around for more than 100 years and hope they'll stick around for a while. Maybe, in another 100 years, even the neighborhood won't look as dodgy as it looks right now. ",0,0,1,0,0

 A lot of places will claim to be ""old-fashioned diners,"" but Merry Ann's is as close to that description as I have ever seen! Merry Ann's is one of my go-to spots for food around campus, and by far my favorite place for breakfast food. The only down-side is that they are frequently under-staffed, but Debbie and her team are always hustling to make up for it. It is very reasonably priced (it comes with being near a college campus), the food is delicious, and the waitstaff and chefs are extremely hard-working. I highly recommend the ham and cheese omelette, which (I believe) includes a choice of pancakes or toast. Go with the pancakes - they are fluffy and piping hot. Oh, and make sure to compliment your meal with coffee. It will come to you in traditional diner fashion - sliding down the table as the coffee swirls around the edges and ever-so-slightly spills over the sides.

 Do not buy anything from them that needs to be delivered. I bought a refrigerator from them and they were supposed to move my old fridge out of the way and put in the new one. I was going to transfer the contents after they left, to take advantage of the $35 Duquesne Light would pay for the old one. The deliverymen claimed that it was against store policy for them to move the fridge if there was anytbhing in it. I called the store manager later and found out that this wasn't true.

 My third Cirque show after Zarkana (which I actually saw at Radio City in New York) and O, which obviously, I saw at Bellagio (a couple of years ago). I know people talk about O being the end all and be all of Cirque du Soleil and even of shows over all in Vegas, but my favorite is still my first - Zarkana. And, while this may be blasphemy, I enjoyed Mystere more than O. Cirque loves putting a lot of pomp into their performances, with very elaborate stages and settings. My girlfriend and I ordered the Cirque movie on netflix once, which was sort of a mix of multiple shows turned into a new story, and we saw a lot of the stages for shows we hadn't seen yet. Very impressive, but sometimes, difficult to know where to look. There's simply too much going on. Mystere, as the original, is very different. The performances and acrobatics are amazing, but there isn't always a lot else going on around the main performances. Sure, a couple of the acts involve multiple side performers, but some are just focused on the 1, or 2 or a few performers. Like all cirque shows, there is some comic relief before and during the show, and it was all funny and very entertaining. The one thing I can say about this show is that it flew by. I remember saying to my girlfriend at the end that I thought we were approaching an intermission. However, the show was over and I looked at the time, and it had been about 90 minutes. I don't know where the time went, but it flew by. The theater itself is really intimate. Don't worry about spending money on the lower half circle of seats - it isn't necessary. If you buy the mid-level seats, or even the cheaper ones, then you'll be fine. I would just try to ensure you are center stage, or as close to there as possible. We sat in the very center of the upper sections, 5th row (EE), and our seats were fantastic. Also, if you sit in the lower sections, there is a chance you're going to get messed with by a pre-show performer. Popcorn was thrown and water was squirted. If you stay a little higher, you can see it all and laugh at the people it's happening to, without getting wet or salty or buttery yourself. ",0,0,0,0,1

 hmmm...fun! sporadic!! energetic!? none of the above. BUT - lovely quiet property. really good food altho the orgasmatron went off only for the tiramisu. GENIUS. I'm a total tiramisu snot ball so if it stinks I don't want it. The lovely Lauren, our waitress recommended it and said if I didn't like it it was on her and I could have the blueberry marscarpone cheesecake instead. Either way I was winning...didn't have to trade off. It was the right amount in a delightful not-too-sweet- chocolate cup. Yummmmm. Oh so you want to know about dinner? I started with the Dungeness crab salad. Nice, light, interesting mix of flavors which I liked very much but left me feeling like something was missing. For dinner I had the seared ahi appetizer - I know, done everywhere but I really just felt like a small portion of nice fish. It was that. Again, good but no wow factor. Perfect for what I wanted but I wished it had more umph. Service was great - it was a slow Monday. Wine list is a budget killer and a bit more manageable by the glass.

 Not sure why everyone is raving about this place. My husband and I just moved into the area and we were looking for a good place to enjoy good breakfast burritos that had a drive thru. We read the reviews about this place and assume we couldn't go wrong. Boy was that a mistake. I got the potato, egg and cheese and it was so dry the only thing that made it edible was my homemade salsa. My husbands chorizo burrito was so overcooked that it was inedible. Why was shocking because I have never seen him put food aside no matter how bad. We couldn't believe that they would put out food that was such poor quality. He works in the food industry and commented that if one of his employees ever served food that bad he would fire them. Instead of going back and giving the manager an earful we decided we would never go back. We just realized that we read all the great reviews and were burned so we decided to write an honest one in case there are any people with standards looking forward to a great meal, so they aren't greatly disappointed.

 Eating at Fogo De Chao is a great experience as long as you enjoy talking to the wait staff constantly. The valet took our car; we entered only to be seated right away in a large grand dining room surrounded by tables and a giant top shelf salad bar. We took our seat at a little two top and immediately we were greeted by one of our several servers throughout the meal with a small green and red disk. After a quick lesson from one of the 20 or so social waiters and waitresses wandering around, we started our dining experience. VEGETARIANS NEED NOT APPLY This place is fantastic with the selections of beef, pork and chicken that are brought to your table as soon as that little disk is turned to green. When your plate is full and you want to eat, just flip it over and enjoy your meal. The ambiance is a little generic big restaurant, but totally worth the visit if you really like to eat meat. Price is ok, but I personally don't have a problem with a 40-50 dollar per plate meal considering all the variety of samplings made available by this Brazilian churrascaria. Sometimes more is less and sometimes you just want to sample multiple dishes, well at Fogo De Chao you can eat as much or as little of many different styles and kinds of meat of your choosing. The only real problem with this restaurant is since there appears to be no sections for individual wait staff, you do, get a little harassed by the wait staff trying to do their job and asking you if ""you're ok"". This is a problem I can deal with for such a fantastically filling eating experience. BE WARNED, WEAR LOSE PANTS ",0,0,0,1,0

 What a great little find. Charming restaurant in a cute neighborhood. From the outside it reminded us of coffee shops that we've visited in Saigon. Inside it's just as charming, as it appears to be an old house turned into a restaurant. A couple things threw us off - wait to be seated, but put your name on the clipboard. Second - large fish in the fish tank that reads ""These fish are our friends, not food"" Anyway on to the menu - great selection of various dishes. Prices are a $1 or $2 more than other Vietnamese places we've tried to far in Phoenix - I'll give that to the area. My wife had a grilled chicken and rice dish, which she absolutely loved. Dark thigh meat chicken (it's flavorful and moist - no chicken breast here) and a lot of it. Standard rice, tomato and cucumber with fish sauce. I chose to have an egg noodle soup (m \ u00ec sui co #20) with sliced pork, pork belly (small cubes of pork belly I believe), wontons and ground pork. Also had bok choy. Great flavorful broth that really hit the spot. Staff was friendly if not a little overwhelmed - place was busy but not slammed and the two younger people working the tables seemed like they were struggling to keep up. We still felt well attended to. Five stars all the way for great food, great ambiance and fair prices. Will be going back before we leave town. ",0,0,0,0,1

 In comparison to Mary's Living and Giving this little ol' Cancer Research doesn't really get a look in. It still has it's fair share of goodies though and it's worthwhile popping into if you're in the area. This branch is well stocked, has an excellent selection of books, CD's, jewellery, ornaments and various other bric-a-brac. In addition to this, the staff are really friendly and it's a pleasant shop to browse. As Marj said, it's for a great cause and it's great to know that if you find something that you like, the money that you pay for it goes to an excellent charity. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is where my husband and I go when neither of us want to cook and we want good food. I love their la italliana pizza and my husband loves the meaty ones. Their antipasto salad is also delish. I love the service here too - a small town local kind of place tucked in a little shopping center. We mostly get takeout here but we've eaten in a few times and the dining atmosphere is great. Always very pleasant people here in great moods because the food is incredible. I don't know what they put in their sauce but there must be some sort of crack in it because it's super addicting. We always come back for more! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Just back from my second-ever trip to Las Vegas. We stayed at the Venetian and had only a so-so experience. We arrived to check-in at about 4:30pm, well after the 3pm check-in period. Our room was not ready; we were told housekeeping was working on it, it would be ready very soon, and would we mind getting a phone call when it was ready? We said OK, put our luggage in temp storage (a convenient touch, no? Only it cost us an extra tip to the bellman... petty to complain about perhaps, but hey, it wasn't our fault the room wasn't ready). An hour and a half later, no phone call. My fiance went to check the status and not ready, not ETA. We gave it another 15 minutes and then were back in line to complain. While in line, we experienced multiple people ignoring the lines and just walking up to the counter... on several occasions they weren't turned away by the hotel staff, who seemed to think line jumping is ""OK""... the patrons waiting in lines didn't find it so... and that includes those in front of and behind us. Once at the counter we voiced our frustrations and became insistent that our room be readied immediately and that we be compensated for our troubles. Miraculously, a room ""became"" available and we were offered $50 dining credit (which, it turns out, was noted on our account but not actually added... we had to call back at the end of our stay to have the credit applied; we'll see if it actually happens this time). My second big issue is that they turn off the smoke ventilation system in the wee hours of the morning. I'm a nonsmoker and this is a problem for me. The smokey smell accumulates in the room during that time period (about 3 hours starting at around 3am)... it accumulates to the point that we could smell it in our bath towels. While expect to smell smoke in the casinos, I don't expect to smell it in my nonsmoking room and I CERTAINLY don't expect it to be so bad that it is in the towels and in clothes that were never out of the suitcase. While overall the room was lovely, I don't think I'd stay there again: too many other options, including at least 1 hotel right on the strip with no casino, which means no smoke. ",0,0,1,0,0

 After eating here, this was the only meal my friend and I talked about for the rest of the trip. The burgers are PERFECT. The fries are fantastic. The alcoholic milkshakes are amazing.

 how we ended up here when we were supposed to be gambling on friday night, i will never know. but 2 bottles later and we were wasted. i had a blast, but i'm not sure if it was the alcohol and company or if it was the actual club. Pink did an impromptu performance, along with Butch Walker (producer) and that rocked. And who remembers that ""butterfly"" song? It's old and was super catchy. Well, that guy was there and sang that. Carey Hart was there and I think I attempted a conversation, but i'm sure it sounded like a bunch of babble from a drunk chick! haha It was fun, I don't know if i'd come back and do the whole bottle service thing, but maybe. it was convenient to go to as it was in the hotel. :) ",0,0,1,0,0

 This place is hard to find in this crazy plaza, but the food makes it all worthwhile. The Herb O'Vores Tacos are one of the most delicious things I have ever had. I've had them twice in State College and once here. I was tempted to try something new on the menu but our waitress said you can never go wrong with the tofu tacos and she is right. I didn't regret it one bit. I can always try making my own thai burrito or spicy buffalo wrap at home. You get three tacos filled with fried cubes of tofu which have been tossed in a light sweet General Tso's type sauce topped with bean sprouts, a green salsa with avocado and served with lime wedges, rice, and black beans. So delicious and it all came out of the kitchen pretty quickly. I love reading their menu. The Mex-Asian dishes all sound awesome. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would come often to try everything. They also have Daiya cheese and vegan cheesecake always on their menu. How sweet is that? My only complaint is that we went just after 5 and it was so dark in the restaurant I could hardly see the menu. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Based on the reviews we read on RestoMontreal we decided to go to this resturant. The service was extremely slow. It took over an hour to bring our pizzas after ordering.

 This is not a pleasant review to write, because I've always enjoyed the Fireside lounge, and would go back there in a heartbeat when looking for a nice place to have a drink with friends. However, the Peppermill restaurant seems to have gone downhill since our last visit. The environment is still wonderful and intimate in its cheesy neon-y way, but something has happened to the food. Namely, it's no longer worth the price they're now asking for relatively simple fare. A basic plate of eggs and pancakes is over $10 now. Omelettes are around $13. Uh... what? $3 for coffee... very, very oily coffee. My chorizo and eggs featured overcooked scrambled eggs with very dried-out chorizo mixed in. The beans that came with them were right out of a can and heated for way too long, until they were cracked and dry. My wife's corn beef hash and eggs was runny, with canned hash underneath. It was greasy and not very good. Normally, I'd not be so disappointed by greasy or not well cooked breakfast food -- they're not called greasy spoons for nothing -- but for the price, the ire rises dramatically. It saddens me to say it, but if you're after great breakfast fare in Vegas, go for Blueberry Hill, or Hash House a go-go instead. You'll be much happier. Maybe we just got a bad line cook that day, but the impression is going to stick with us for quite a long time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 As people said, there are separate lines for each kind of taco. My go to taco is usually the lengua. Some people are uncomfortable eating tongue, but honestly it's some of the most tender meat possible. Unfortunately I was little underwhelmed by the lengua here. The meat wasn't as savory as I've had at other places. Looking at the reviews, I guess I should have tried the pork. Maybe next time... ",0,0,1,0,0

 Let's be clear- the 5 stars is about the food and the service. This isn't a fancy 5 star restaurant but that's not what the stars mean on Yelp- as we all (should) know! We moved here from Southern California in August, so it's safe to say we've had our share of excellent traditional Mexican food. Since our first trip to Maize we go there at least once a week- it's so good. BE PREPARED: Parking can be a problem and it's almost always packed. People frequently come in and order for takeout. In our experience, by the time we order a seat almost always clears up. We have never taken it to go. If you eat there, you get free (freshly made!) chips and salsa while you wait for your food. Since it's just the two of us, we have always been lucky. If you have a big group, I'd suggest ordering it to go and eating at home or having a picnic. You can call your order in too, which is nice. The food is always ready super fast, so even if you order to go, you won't wait long. The staff is extremely kind and happy to answer questions if you're not sure what something is. I've tried many things on the menu but keep coming back to the tacos- chicken or fish are my fav- because of the RIDICULOUSLY amazing corn tortillas. So. Good. Word on the street is that they'll be opening a larger location near the Amtrak in Champaign soon. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Well for starters I like the fact that finally a decent place has opened up in the big intersection of University and Mill. They are directly competing with Chilli's and P.F.Chang's now!

The setting of the place and ambiance seem to be crying oldtown culture out loud, which brings some freshness to mill ave, but only time will tell how the crowd here is going to accept that. oh and I dont remember there being any drink specials or such.

 I have not been there in years, but we had a family get together and pizza won. We got our table and the server took a few minutes to get there. No big deal. Problem - I went to the rest room and almost gagged. The WORST smelling restroom I had ever been in; it smelled like a port-a-john in July. Ugh, so bad. The waiter was nice guy, he joked with the kids and kept the drinks full. Not unusual, but I noticed he did not write anything down when the 10 of us were giving our orders. I've had plenty of servers in the past who have just taken our order by memory. The key is, ya gotta remember that order correctly. Clearly he did not as the veggie pizza had 3 meats on it. oops. That being said, the pizzas were fantastic and the beers were cheap. $2 for domestic and $3 for craft beers; ya cant beat that. I'd go back again. I just would not use their restroom again....ever!

Maybe I was so hungry from travelling all day that average food tasted wonderful, but I honestly think they just have really good cooks at this location.

 7 girls + 18 dishes + 2 pitchers of Sangria = a tummy full of HAPPINESS!! Went on a girls reunion trip with the UCLA girls to Vegas and we knew we wanted to have a good dinner meal for Saturday. With no idea what to get, the lovely May suggested Firefly. We heard it could be busy so we called to see if we could make reservations but they told us it wasn't that busy around 6:30 which was the time we wanted to go and that it gets busy later at night (very true). The atmostphere is awesome. It's dim with red accents, and there's latin dance type of music playing. Right when we walked in I had already seen two of the waiters/waitresses dancing a little- it was very cute. So we sat down, and decided to order whatever we felt like because either way it would have been cheaper than if we had decided to go to Joel Robuchon's restaurant in the MGM (which I definitely want to try). Here's what we ordered- 1. 2 plates stuffed dates ----soooo good 2. 2 plates manchego mac & cheese- pretty good but not the best of all the dishes 3. 2 plates of chorizo & chicken stuffed mushrooms 4. ceviche shrimp- very good 5. Thai beef salad 6. petite filet 7. lambchops 8. spicy lamb sausage 9. mussels 10. shrimp diabla 11. paella 12. ham and cheese croquetas 13. tuna tartare 14. chocolate cherry bread pudding 15. dessert platter My favorites- stuffed dates, the ceviche, the petite filet, stuffed mushrooms, ham and cheese croquetas, lamb sausage & Paella- the paella is very good to get and large enough to share with a lot of people. My least favorites- the tuna tartare (tasted a little funny, we think they added mayo or something to it) and the lambchops (didn't have that lamb flavor). and of course the chocolate bread pudding was very good with ice cream. The dent- only $35 per girl with tip. A lot better than the minimum of at least $100 at Robuchon =) ",0,0,0,0,1

 I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars. I'm surprised by the poor reviews. I had the best and most unique sandwich in a very long time. The server (Tessa) was fabulous, friendly and efficient. I enjoyed the wine I ordered and everything about the place, as well as Meow Meow, the resident cat who makes herself more than comfortable on the cushioned couch. I had the ""Love Me Tenderloin"" Sandwich. OMG! It was absolutely DELICIOUS! I have not raved about a meal at a restaurant in a loooong time. It was juicy, tasty, messy, yummy. I chose side salad with it. I also had the edamame and took that home because I had to finish the sandwich. It was that good. I came here from Minnesota to escape the winter. A couple girlfriends are joining me here and I have been scoping places to take them. I will take them here. They will love it. Yeah, it is a bit pricy, but I got much better value here than I did at Terroir Wine Pub. Far friendlier service, more food and better food! If you are in Phoenix and dont' know where to go, go here. It has a great patio, fabulous service, friendly staff, great food and wine. You could go here and then to Postino before or after. They are within a couple miles of each other.

 We came on Cinco de Mayo and this place was dead. It was 1pm and we were the only customers in the entire restaurant. This wasn't terrible as we got extra attention and double the wait staff. We opted to sit outside so we could enjoy the weather. There was a nice breeze, so it was extremely enjoyable. The patio is also really nice. You can see into another restaurant's patio, but a small man-made river parts the two patios. We took our time looking over the menu and finally decided upon the sizzling rice soup, the steamed dumplings, and the moo shu pork. Our soup and dumplings came out first. Our waitress put the soup together before our eyes, placing the rice into the pot to make it sizzle. It was very good - similar to an egg drop broth but with chicken, shrimp, peas, carrots, mushrooms and slightly crunchy rice. The dumplings were spectacular. Super soft and had a great flavor. Next, our entr \ u00e9e arrived. Our waiter actually filled and rolled our moo shu pork right in front of us. We've order moo shu pork at other restaurants and always have had to put it together ourselves. This was a nice treat to see it done for it. (He did a great job wrapping them!)

 I stopped in this weekend to pick up some snorkelling gear for my vacation. After waiting about 15 minutes before I had to ask for help, I explained that my main goal for next summer was to take my SCUBA courses at Total Diving so I wanted to pick up a good mask and snorkel. Though I'm only snorkelling, this year, I wanted to get informed as to what differentiates a mediocre set from a great set. Sadly, in my short research of what I should purchase, it seems that I've gained more knowledge than the gentleman serving me. He did't know what a dry snorkel was or even what a semi-dry snorkel was. This was disturbing, considering that's all they had in stock. Instead, he showed me a bunch of cheap, basic, semi-dry snorkels and pointed out that they were dry. Sadly, they were not. Considering their less than impressive knowledge level in the most basic of diving equipment, I decided not to purchase anything and visit some of the other dive shops in Montreal, this week. I've also decided to do my research, in greater depth, to find a place to take my courses, next summer, because it certainly won't be here. If you don't know the difference between snorkels, I'm not sure I want to put my life in your hands. Less than confidence inspiring, guys... ",1,0,0,0,0

 Top line: decent food, had a few quirks with service/layout. Was surprised by this place, thought it would be a grab and go place, but it was a sit down place. Waitress was super nice, but clearly didn't have much experience. Poor flow for the wait-staff, there was only one terminal, so there was perpetually a line. Weirdest part, they didn't have a hood over the cooking area so the whole place was kind of smokey. Bottom line: food was fine, but won't be back. If there were a few changes, might go back.

 I went to Vegas for a weekend in May, and all told I spent less than $300. I made a little money playing poker, so I only left $170 in Sin City. That's for food, gas, hotel, everything. One of the reasons I was able to do this was that I got two meals out of Earl of Sandwich for a grand total of $6.48. My car got to Vegas hours before our friends, so we decided to have a cheap, casual dinner. I did a quick search on Yelp, and this place came up with its hundreds of reviews. Earl of Sandwich is in Planet Hollywood, a kind of funny theme hotel if you know anything about Los Angeles. I find it amusing that the mall is billed as the Miracle Mile Shops, as if the Miracle Mile is a glamorous shopping mecca in L.A. Even Earl of Sandwich is out of place - it's a chain restaurant, but there isn't a single branch in California. Don't be alarmed that it's a chain. It's a step up from Quizno's (though I like Quizno's, and Subway, too), and I appreciated its impressive efficiency. There was a short line to order, but once we got our orders in, we sat down with our buzzers. They started buzzing while we were getting water, and our food was hot and ready within five minutes of arrival. I ordered the Full Montagu with roast beef, turkey, aged swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce. I had half for dinner and half for lunch the next day - I never went hungry, and the sandwich reheated great. It was really tasty, with good ingredients and plenty of them. I also tried some of my friends' orders - the Italian sandwich and the Earl's Cobb. The Italian was maybe even better than the Montagu, with a meatfest of salami, capicola, ham, and mortadello, topped with mozzarella, roma tomato, and a zesty Italian dressing. Peppers were optional and delicious. Even the salad was pretty good. It wasn't a deprivation salad - it came with plenty of grilled chicken and bacon, swiss and cheddar cheese, and a buttermilk ranch dressing. But it also had plenty of greens and tomato, cucumber, and cranberries. If you're in Vegas for the full Vegas experience, go balls out, hit Robuchon, whatever you want. But it's nice to know that you can eat something good for $5.99 and tax. I love a good sandwich, and the Earl delivers. ",0,0,0,1,0

 You can not judge a book by it's cover- Nor can you judge a restaurant by it's unassuming appearance.... Because this place has Great food EVERYTIME! Yesterday, I picked up my friend Lisa and we decided to do some old school Henderson Eating! El Torito has been in Henderson for as long as I can remember- It has gone from a one room eatery to a nice size cafe. I am not crazy about their nachos or fajitas ... but what is good- is their traditional style mexican food. Cheese enchiladas.. YUM Green chili pork enchiladas double YUM Their tacos with homemade shells are delicious too. They have so many good items that it is hard to put them all right here. Yesterday I had a green chili pork enchilada AND a ground beef taco. DIVINE! Also sampled some chips with their unique and totally scrumptious salsa. Their rice is not like most rice at a mexican food eatery. It is their own recipe and it is not tomato based... hands down the best mexican rice ever. They also make albondigas soup , which is a treat you simply can not miss out on. I love that this restaurant is family owned and passed down generation to generation. Unbelievably good...

 Totally agree with Keeley's review, I got the same treatment while trying to get a simple answer about pricing. It's not the rep's fault, they are taught this bullshit tactic by upper upper management to try and confuse the potential customer into giving up all hope of a clear answer and just giving up their credit card. It's called ""Perceived value"" - starting high and discounting it back down to normal prices making it look like you're getting a huge discount. My story is just as long as Keeley's and even gets worse, I tried calling 5 different times and talked to 5 different people before giving up myself....and going with Directv. NOTE: This review doesn't reflect my experience with this specific Dish Network provider or installer, just the company in general.

 We went to have Taiwanese breakfast on Sunday morning. We got there just before 11:30am and they served breakfast only until 11:30am. It was after 11:30am by the time we got a table (it was packed in there), but luckily they still took our order for the breakfast special. It consisted of hot soya bean milk, Chinese donut, and a pastry bun. This typical Taiwanese breakfast combo was not bad for $3.99. The soya bean was very strong flavor and made fresh at the restaurant. The Chinese deep fried donut was not quite up to par, not chewy and holey enough, but okay. The pastry bun was flaky, although for my taste buds, I would prefer it to be filled with some sort of meat. We also ordered xiu long bao, salty rice roll and a beef sandwich. The xiu long bao was quite tasty, but a little on the small size. The salty rice roll which consists of glutinous rice wrapped around a Chinese donut with dried pork jerky was not bad. It tastes quite good, but the Chinese donut inside was overcooked and a little too hard for my liking. Lastly, the beef sandwich had slices of marinated beef in the pastry bun. It didn't come with any sauce, so to me the sandwich was on the dry side. The flavor of the beef could also be improved. So overall, I think this place is only deserving of 2.5 stars. Oh, one last note, although they have waitress to serve you, they also have a table at the side, where you can pick up your own plastic utensils, napkins and get your own water to drink. Pretty weird huh? ",0,1,0,0,0

 If you're looking for a centrally located place to stay on the strip, the Imperial Palace has you covered. If you love filthy rooms and decrepit conditions, the Imperial Palace has you covered. If you're one of those people that think a hotel room is just a place to pass out in, the Imperial Palace has you covered. If you enjoy the smell of a wet fart wrapped in an ashtray, then you're absolutely going to love the Imperial Palace. Don't enjoy being clean or smelling good? You'll be in great company at the Imperial Palace. Are you're looking to relive those glory days when all the frat boys on your floor stayed up all night yelling drunken nonsense down the halls? Don't worry, with room rates so low, drunk college kids can't afford to stay anywhere else! The Imperial Palace is like a good prison rape, it's a sweaty, smelly pain in the ass and you just want it to be over as quick as possible. If none of that really strikes your fancy...you might want to spend the extra $10 a night and stay somewhere decent. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We went for breakfast, I had coffee (mocha latte I believe they called it) scrambled eggs, bacon and a fruit cup (which was about 6 pieces of mostly melon). It was good, nothing great but not bad. Reminded me of a Panera or Corner bakery, maybe with a bit more options. I got the chippers, and sadly I can't say I was a fan :( I'm just not a fan of small, super crunchy cookies (I like mine soft). ",0,0,1,0,0

 it's been a while since the one and only time i went here, but it deserves a review, simply because of what happened there. we were well on our way to having a hang over the next day, which seems like the only way to go to this bar. we walked in (group of 6), and managed to find a table, inside, where the karaoke was happening. we're not that into karaoke, but it is free entertainment. as soon as we sat down, a woman started singing. she was pretty decent and the song was a crowd pleaser. then it happened. some dude, about 5'2"" gets up on stage, and starts dancing at her, while she's singing. i say at, because she was not dancing. no one was. except this guy, who was also in his mid-40s and sporting a sweet comb-over. it was seriously like someone planted him as a prank, like we were being taped for a surprise tv show. we all sat there looking at each other, then looking at him, then back at each other. the lady was a trooper, she just kept singing. finally, the song was over, and he opened his arms up, like he was going to hug her. finally, some other guy from the audience, pulled him away, back down to his seat. very awkwardly. that's not why i'm giving this 2 starts. we were there a good 15 minutes total, and never saw a server. more beer might have saved the situation, in some way. with no beer in sight, we bolted. we couldn't handle another episode like that, with nothing to wash it down with.

 The first time I stayed here was in 2004 - about two years after it opened so everything was still new. I've stayed here one weekend each summer since then. It's hard to believe that it's been 8 years since my first visit but what can I say, I LOVE this resort. The valet, front desk and the bellhops were the nicest, respectful and most helpful people. I can't say enough good things about them, so very friendly! My last visit was for three days over Labor Day weekend and I was happy to see that everything inside of the resort is still in impeccable shape. The pool area however was not as shiny as usual. The umbrellas needed some repairs and the chairs were all sun bleached. Another thing I didn't like was the inconsistency in the ""pool rules."" In previous stays, you weren't allowed to take the inner tubes out of the lazy river but this weekend, everyone was hording their tubes by their chairs, not only making it difficult to walk around but also forcing many people inside the lazy river to walk instead of float, it looked like a zombie walk. Also, I like to bring a cooler bag with snacks and drinks because I'm literally at the pool from sun up to sun down and I won't pay $12 for a drink every time someone gets thirsty - everyone got ONE $12 drink a day, that it! I've never had a problem with bringing a cooler bag before but this year, some of the staff would allow it and others would not. I really like the packages that the resort offers, I was able to save a lot on Wi-Fi and resort fees just by going with a package - plus I got a $100 resort credit which was amazing. I definitely recommend going with a package. Also, if you're going to stay longer than one night, I recommend bringing a cooler - you can save a lot on drinks and snacks. The resort offers a nice little market where you can pick up snacks but you're going to pay three times more than you would at a grocery store. You can use ice from their ice machine to replenish the ice in your cooler. It's easy to rack up a large bill at this resort, cutting corners helps. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Immediate tummy ache!!! I should've stayed away after reading the reviews but it was close and it was late at night so I gave in. In short, one freezer wasn't working so all tubs were stacked on top of each other in working freezer. Took too long to sample flavors because she had to move tubs around. Husband was not impressed so just told me to chose what I wanted n get out of there. I chose on a Sunday, pictured with chocolate syrup, walnuts, banana, and two scoops of ice cream advertised at $5.50. Chose green tea and taro...ask for no chocolate syrup. Came to check out and she charged me a $0.25 fee. When I asked her what that was for she said for the banana. After pointing out the price and picture, her answer was ""That's from a long time ago"" !?!?!??!?? I told her my piece of mind, mentioned I was a yelp de-customer and went outside to eat. Halfway through my Sunday my stomach is turning... We're pulling into our driveway now and I am running straight to the toilet. Avoid this place, as a fellow business owner, know that I've discounted many clients because they had seen other pricing (be it old). It's all about customer retention. FAIL! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Me and my husband went for a mini valentines getaway. We arrived at the Flamingo around 9pm the line was a bit long it must have been 20 minutes wait. However the long wait is so worth it. I ask the guy if they can give us a 'good room' , he said just a moment i will ask my manager. After about 3 minutes he came out and said the manager approved to upgrade our room to a mini suite at the 27th floor. We paid about $38 per night for a mini suite. Its awesome!! The room has a classic look, old furnitures, old TV, king size bed with old white headboard. Big bathroom with a tub. A vanity mirror , and nice toiletries. There is a big living room with classic furnitures and carpet that is so 70's i felt like im living in a different generation.The view of our room is the pool area and the newer tower that is pink. The place is massive and it is such a wonderful experience. Thank you Flamingo for the upgrade you made us very very happy. I will definitely go back to your hotel. ",0,0,0,1,0

 So I wouldn't normally drive all the way to Cave Creek for anything but we had the week off, I had to go to Desert Ridge, and I saw this place in the Phoenix Magazine. Needless to say, save the gas. The place is cute on the inside and really had a lot of promise. The sides all sounded good and I couldn't decide between the pulled pork or the brisket so I got both. Added a side of potato salad and a side of beans. Where to begin? The pork wasn't bad but it wasn't bbq. I mean, it didn't taste smokey or sweet. It tasted boiled...and that's nasty. It was fatty and generally just lacking flavor. The bbq sauce they put on the thing was decent but they didn't have any of it out for me to get more. What they did have were ""regular"" and ""spicy"" bbq sauces. Both were thin, both were a bit spicy, and neither was up to the task of fixing this pork. The brisket was really a disaster. It was cut like ham slices. Really thick with a big hunk of fat around the outside that I had to remove from each slice. This whittled my beef down to medallion sized bits. The taste was fine but the thick texture, lack of bbq sauce, and fatty presentation was all disappointing. The beans were okay but I expected sweeter. BBQ baked beans, in my mind, should be sweet and savory. These, like everything else here, were just bland and dull. I tried mixing some of the runny bbq sauce available but it really didn't help. The saving grace was the potato salad. This was some of the best stuff I've ever had. I would totally buy a pound of that to bring to a dinner party. They should package it and sell it in the stores. Really it was creamy and sweet without overpowering the potato flavor. Good stuff and well executed. Will not be going back here. Too bad too because it had a lot of promise. Oh well. There is no shortage of bbq in the valley. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It's no secret that this place is good. I wouldn't expect anything less. From the moment your brought up in the elevator to the moment you head back to the hustle and bustle of the casino, you definitely are living an experience. Low lighting and a view that can't be beat, fine linens, and wait staff who attend to your every need, the Eiffel Tower is first class all the way. I selected their smoked salmon to start and I have never had a better piece of fish. Smooth, thinly sliced, and melt in your mouth buttery taste accompanied the onion, capers, and creme fraiche (not sure of my French spelling here) with several slices of perfectly toasted bread. I could have eaten a second plate and called it a meal. The capers were surprisingly delicious - not the over salted from a jar variety. Most of us selected their filet mignon, with several different toppings to choose from. I couldn't resist and chose the decadent Bernaise sauce. The steak itself was cooked to perfection and the interior was almost as buttery smooth as the sauce itself. There were a ton of sides passed around our table, but the winners were the potatoes gratin (perfect in their simplicity) and the mushroom sp \ u00e4tzle (yes they eat German food in parts of France). Desserts probably deserve their own review, but to put it simply; save room and order a bunch to taste and share. The chocolate plate will leave any chocoholic in heaven. Pricey, but worth every penny. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Went to cafe el dorado simply because we didn't have the 45 minutes to wait in line at l'avenue (which is a delicious breakfast place right across the street). The prices here were more expensive and the food was ill-prepared. Their china and cutlery reminded me of that time I ate in this diner in the middle of nowhere built in the seventies that hadn't been redecorated or cleaned since then. I ordered a dish which they served with stale potatoes that Tasted a day old and fruit that was much older than that. They tried cutting the rotten parts of the fruit off but left a little behind. They then placed the fruit nice side up, leaving the rotten bits face down hoping I wouldn't notice. DISGUSTING STAY AWAY. and as for speaking English, they are extremely rude here. Not tourist friendly, service is in French only. last I checked Canada is bilingual ",1,0,0,0,0

 I wish I could like this place more. The decor basically screams ""Austin Powers!"" redux, the Beatles are my favorite band, and the entrance which is basically a wall spelling out ""REVOLUTION"" that you enter through the spaces between the letters is really cool. Unfortunately the music here is at best hit and miss: There's really nothing to set it apart from any other club/lounge when they spin the same techno/house as every other place on the Strip and if you can't do that any better (and actually a lot worse) than you competitors then you should at least commit to the Beatles theme fully and play some of their classics. The bartenders all look like they're miserable behind the bar but at least the waitresses serving the tables try to look like they don't hate being there. The drinks are rather standard price for a lounge (13-14 for a scotch) and the table service is really cheap but this isn't the type of place you would want to spend too much time. Promoters in the Mirage give out all sorts of promotions: guys can usually get free entry before 11/12 and girls get open bar for a few hours, but as you'd expect it's all well drinks. The crowd is mainly 30 somethings and no one is particularly well dressed but you'll probably run into a few conventioneers rocking the 3 piece suit and standing uncomfortably by the bar. On the plus side, they usually have the Go-Go dancers who aren't dancing at the moment handing out free shots on the dance-floor. I don't know what was in those (they looked purple and tasted a bit like blueberries) but I know that after my friend downed 4 of them and a few vodka tonics he was compelled to inform the girl handing them out that ""she was the most beautiful person"" he had ever seen.

 Every city has one: one of those huge complexes that houses a cinema, a bowling alley, a casino, a Nando's, etc etc but not a lot of atmosphere. In Edinburgh, it's a tie-up between here and the Omni Centre. Despite how ugly and soul-less they are, these places do serve their purpose. You're all agreed on the fact that you want to do something with your evening, but nobody's up for a big full-blown night out; nor can anyone decide where to go/what to do. It's a simple solution - hope in a taxi to Fountain Park and you're bound to find something to please at least most people. Be careful though, it's one of those places where you come out having spent way more than you planned to. In the bowling alley a vodka & coke costs the same as in the average George Street bar! Word of warning number #2: it's chav central, especially on weekends. If you're in a big group, you'll invariably have a good time here because there'll be so many of you that you won't notice all the annoying/tacky things about this place. Otherwise, there are plenty of other restaurants and bars and even another casino much closer to the city centre. ",0,0,1,0,0

 On arrival we were told it would be 30 minutes before seats would be available, but the same meal could be prepared for us in the kitchen. We opted for this alternative rather than wait which turned out to be a big, big mistake. We started out with the edamame appetizer. This represented our first and last experience with boiled salted soybeans - totally tasteless. My wife chose the halibut dinner while I requested chicken. She received two decent sized pieces of fish, but each was overdone. My chicken, cut into inch cubes, was dry. Each entree included miso soup, noodles, veggies, rice and salad. The soup was hot, but everything else was served cold. Service was affable, but slow. ",1,0,0,0,0

 So I REALLY want to like this place. The decor is awesome, service was average, nothing to complain about, nothing to rave about. Went for a late Sunday lunch. Got the Bacon Blue chips for an app. They were nice and crispy but had BBQ flavor powder all over them, like what you get out of the bag. Kinda strange, but edible. Boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich with ham (forgot what it was called). It was pretty good from the bite I had. The slaw on the side was good according to him, but can you really go wrong with sriracha slaw? I ordered the OMG burger and fries. The burger was anything but OMG... the bun was charred, the onions were supposed to be carmelized but were just transparent and bland(no seasoning or even S&P) mushrooms were just there, no texture, no flavor and the burger was way over done and dry also no basic salt & pepper. I barely ate half and gave the rest to my garbage disposal aka boyfriend. All it would have taken for this to be a great burger was some salt and pepper!! I hate to say it but I've had a better burger from a fast food chain. And we all know those aren't good... Maybe we went there on an off day or tried the right food (if it's on the menu it should be good, right?) Maybe we'll give it another shot. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've been getting lost and p.o.ed in this hotel since 1998. Even stayed here once out of desparation, much to my chagrin. All other properties in Vegas, including MGM properties, have signs clearly directing you to all the restaurants by name. A restaurant changes, they change the sign. But apparently Excalibur cannot be bothered. There's just a general sign at the escalator that says ""Restaurants"" implying that all the restaurants are upstairs. But they are not. Once you get upstairs, you'll find a couple of banners above the escalators that try to explain with oddly placed arrows where specific restaurants, registration, etc. are located. But the banners make no sense. It's so annoying. Also, this hotel was rundown in 1998 and is doubly so today. It smells funny. The smoke over the years has inflitrated every nook and cranny, making the whole place smell like a giant, nasty ashtray. Since it is part of the weird, circuitious path that allows you to traverse the Strip in mostly air conditioned comfort, sometimes it becomes a necessity to come here. Or if someone's band is playing here. Over the years, I've seen more live acts here for free than anywhere on the Strip. But otherwise I try to avoid it if at all possible. ",0,1,0,0,0

 As a real estate investor, I need contractors that I can truly count on to get things done for me. This means that my calls get returned in a timely fashion, work is done properly, quickly and competently but most importantly, that I get quoted a fair price for a good job.

 Yes, I got to spend $5 on a small cup of fro yo! Wanting a cool and light treat, I headed over to Yovana on my layover. I don't know what it is about frozen yogurt places that makes people become mindless idiots but the people in front of me seemed to be confused by the whole frozen yogurt process and how to order. The girls working there didn't help either as there were three of them on staff but more engulfed in their conversation about their latest tattoo than reducing the size of the line. Ordered the white chocolate macadamia nut and it was meh. Paid more to have fresh strawberries on it and soon found out that they put the strawberries in the middle of the cup of yogurt rather than on it-not a fan.

 Oh Holy Land. Why are you serving such shitty stale pita with such awesome hummus? Why did your baba ghanoush get all weird? Still tasty, actually, but there didn't seems to be much eggplant in it. Maybe you did what you did another time, which was to substitute something else for the item that you were out of without mentioning it to me? Backstory: I love the appetizer sampler. I am addicted to the hummus and falafel. I'm not a big fan of grape leaves but that's just a thing about me, and these grape leaves could totally be the best ever. And there is, in theory baba ghanoush. Story: But this one time I ordered it and the only things that came out were falafel and hummus. Which was great for me, except maybe they might have at least mentioned ""we are out of half the things in this menu item."" Holy Land, you do not have people skills. I stopped eating meat awhile back but when I did eat the chicken and lamb kabobs here they were pretty awesome. I would probably recommend what I am doing tonight- eating the appetizer sampler and scooping up tons of tasty hummus with fresh vegetables instead of stupid stale pita.

 I was visiting Las Vegas this past weekend and I happened to try this spot out because it was one of the few Japanese-owned restaurants in that mile of mostly Korean and Chinese pretendo choices. I stood in front of owner/manager for about 5 minutes while waiting for some sort of hello, right after walking in. It was a bad start and I almost walked right out again. The clientele range from loud, obnoxious tourists to pretty Cosplay girls and their Vin Diesel wannabee boyfriends. The food was exceptional for the price. And I mean exceptional...for the price. It was tasty. Very cheap compared to LA. As was the alcohol. And there was not one thing that was not memorable. Service was super fast. Everyone was helpful and polite. And the manager completely redeemed himself by the end of the night. All in all, I would live here if I lived in Vegas. 4 stars as a restaurant. 5 stars as a Japanese restaurant in the USA. If you can deal with the sea of touristy idiots surrounding you, you will have a good time. Just listen to their conversations. Who knew that ""like"" was a verb, adjective and noun.

 First visit 3 stars, second visit 2 stars unfortunately. I don't doubt the pasta is still A-OK, but I have to knock them down for their entree-sized salads. I ordered a Caesar with chicken. The addition of the chicken bumped the price of this jewel up to $12.95. While plentiful, the romaine was so drenched in dressing, the crispness of the lettuce was lost. The chicken was mediocre at best, certainly not worth the 5 bucks to add it. A shame because the dressing was pretty good. My husband ordered the Antipasto per Due. With back olives, artichokes, ham, salami, provolone, and anchovies, it should have been a hit. But again, drenched in vinaigrette. Also the meats and cheese were just thin slices, nothing of exceptional quality. At $14.95, this was a miss. We also ordered bruschetta, but I had forgotten all their bread is sesame seed ""sub rolls."" Better bread is a must. While I might consider Lo Cascio again, I'll stick with pasta.

 I love shopping but hate spending precious $. I typically shop gently used/consignment shops and have been shopping at these types of stores for awhile now. My kids love it here because it's a store ""just for them"" and they have an enclosed play area too so mom/dad can shop while they play. :) This store is organized and the staff is very sweet. They have loads of clothing that is in good/great condition. The only ""wish"" I have is that their prices were a bit less. I bought a button up shirt for $3.50 and a nice jacket and pant suit for $7.50. I would have been happy with a $2.00 shirt and $6.00 set but oh well...they were both really cute and still cheaper than buying brand new. As far as baby gear, the prices again are a bit high but you can be sure none of their gear is expired and doesn't have recalls on it. You can't always be sure of these things if you buy from CraigsList or garage sale sites. Still, cheaper than buying brand new and in good-great condition. They have a customer rewards program too. You get a stamp for every $10 you spend. Once you have so many stamps on their reward card, you get 15% off your entire next purchase. Not amazing but still, money saved. I didn't trade anything in but I have at other places like this before. One thing I will say is if you are expecting to get even close to what you paid for the item; don't bring it to places of this nature. To be honest, when I shop on garage sale type sites and people are asking $60 for a used swing or something of that sort, it is quite irritating. I typically won't pay over 30% of what I can get it for retail if I'm buying from a private seller. At least I can understand with a brick and mortar business because they have lots of overhead but they do alot of leg work with recalls/expiration dates and they are typically a bit more discriminatory when it comes to accepting items. Nevertheless, if you just want to get rid of your items and make a few bucks then yes, this would be a good place to come. Also don't expect to bring in all of your winter items at the beginning of summer and expect to get top dollar; regardless of what condition your clothes are in. I do wish they had more boys accessories; bow tie's, tie's, suspenders, etc. Overall, it's a cool little store and I bought 2 button up boy shirts, 1 boy jacket and pant set, a seersucker kids jacket, a pair of Nike shoes for an 8 year old girl, and a pair of girls tights for $33!

 Avoid renting from this location if at all possible. I had a prepaid reservation and when I arrived there were about 200 people in line and there was a 4 hour wait for a car. Clearly Hertz prefers to collect money on late returns and offers no assistance or credit whatsoever to those who have a paid reservation. Luckily I was able to get a refund on my reservation and took a cab to my hotel. Hertz had no answer when I asked for cab fare or assistance in booking with another company. They simply told us to go wait in the other lines or make calls on our own. This seems to be common with hertz. Lines are always long and nothing seems to be easy. I had a similar issue in San Diego. I never have this issue with Alamo or Enterprise. Unfortunately when using hot-wire, you take a risk. Keep that in mind - ESPECIALLY if you see a ""too good to be true"" rate. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We were supposed to arrive Friday, but wanted to see if we could come a day early to enjoy a full day by pool. My wife called the hotel and asked them if we came a day early would we still be able to get the adjoining rooms for our kids. The lady said she had to check, so put my wife on hold for almost 20 minutes to confirm with the front desk that they could accommodate us. She finally came back and said yes. So we left California and headed out. When we arrived, at check-in, the lady said that they don't have any adjoining rooms at all. We told them about our call and even the person we spoke to, but to no avail. We asked to see the Manager, George. When he came over we explained the whole story and he was unsympathetic and inflexible. We have 3 daughter that would have to stay in their own room separate from us all under 15 yrs. old. He didn't offer us anything as compensation for their error until we argued and said isn't there anything you can do? He reluctantly gave us $20 off ea. room. They ended up giving us a room for us and a room for our kids (a mini suite) on the same floor. When we went up to the rooms, our room was decent, but the girls room was over 50 suites away down at the far end of the corridor. When we got there, the mini suite had stained carpet, and looked dingy and my kids were scared to be so far away from us, which I don't blame them. We proceeded to take them to our room and had to fit all 5 of us into our room for the night, with a roll-a-way. We called down to the front desk to tell them that the room for the kids was unacceptable and the same manager said that we already paid so nothing he could do. My wife started explaining how unfair and unreasonable they were being and he finally came around and said that they would credit us for the room we never used and told them we wouldn't use only fifteen minutes after they gave it to us. They next day we switched rooms to 2 adjoining rooms and the accommodations were fair. We enjoyed our trip despite the problems. There were several employees that were very nice and helpful, but that first night was a nightmare. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I could make a better sandwich with a used sock and two pop tarts. I get that it's a healthier alternative to the other off-highway garbage when you have to eat or die on a long road trip, but if you're one of these people who seek out Subway... in a city... and think it's good... you should be beaten with one of their awful ""fresh baked"" loaves of bread.

 First off I love good BBQ, but I am a little picky in the fact that I don't want my food drowned in sauce, I want to be able to taste the flavor of the meat. Joe's Real BBQ does just that, they serve you all the meats you want with the sauce on the side, with the exception of the ribs. I was a big fan of Rudy's BBQ for that same reason as well however I must say Joe's is much better. The meat by itself has very good flavor and its cooked to perfection. We tried the beef brisket, pulled pork, hot-links, and the ribs. I loved the brisket, it was so moist and flavorful. The ribs, while the sauce was a little sweet for me the meat just fell off the bones. My husband really enjoyed the hot-links along with the pulled pork. They do have a lot of options for sides however they were a bit small in portions, our favorite side was the mac and cheese. The atmosphere is welcoming with the family style picnic type seating.

 The food here is not good at all. We ordered bbq beef brisket and sausage and the tuna melt. The brisket was smothered in bbq sauce which I could live with but the meat had fat on it which should have been trimmed off. Nothing is worse than unknowingly putting a fork full of fat in your mouth. The cornbread was old and dry and the side of potato salad was discolored on the top and old as if it was sitting for a while uncovered. It tasted like supermarket potato salad (no flavor). My girlfriend had the tuna melt and only ate half. She said it wasn't good, had no flavor and didn't want any more. The name FARM and signage leads you to believe that the food served would be a fresh farmers market type meal, similar to the Hash House. Service was not bad but just okay. In comprehension, the Cannery's cafe provides much better service. I have ate at a lot different places on all levels and this is gotta be one of the worse. I'm not the guy that is going to complain because a poorly ran establishment is the fault of management not the workers. I just simply never return. I gotta say that the House of Pancakes the once occupied this restaurant was excellent and I am not sure why it was closed. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Went to Koi in July. Just realized I didn't write a review. I wanted to eat at the Sushi bar, unfortunately it is not wheelchair accessible, so I ate in the main dining area. My server was very nice and apologetic about it.I ordered Sushi anyway. My standard Salmon and Eel. It was very good, but much smaller portions than at Simon. I also ordered the Sunset roll, which was Eel an cucumber inside with Avocado and special sauce on top. Another very good dish. I had a Sake flight with my food. This is a very nice way to try several types without sliding out of my chair! I wish it was more wheelchair accessible, but I did enjoy the food and I am going back in a couple weeks to give it another try! Probably more like 3 1/2 stars. ",0,0,1,0,0

 My initial review of Sunset Pizzeria was based on only one experience. I wasn't completely sold on the pizza, or the wings, but after waiting about a year we decided to give them another try. And I am so happy we did! Sunset Pizzeria is now our go-to place for pizza in Hendertucky... We got takeout from them on a recent Friday night... and then again on Sunday night.... and then when we had some unexpected company, AGAIN on Thursday night... 3 times in one week!! I think that warrants an upgrade from 3 to 4 stars. I still don't love the wings or the chicken fingers... but the salads are decent, we get the antipasto often. The pizza is great. I love, love, LOVE the crust and that they are generous with the toppings. I also love that when I get food to go from Sunset, the employees always make sure we have everything we need... plenty of dressing for the salad, extra sauce for chicken, plasticwear, napkins. I think it may be time for a pizza intervention at my house, since we ordered so many times in just a week. It's just so good, and perfect for those hectic evenings when you don't have time to cook!

 I was tempted to go with a one star on this one, but I finished SOME of my dinner. We ordered delivery from this place tonight and it was pretty awful. The delivery driver was super nice, but it was all downhill from there. We ordered egg rolls, hot and sour soup, General Tso's chicken and vegetable chow mein. The egg rolls were fine, nothing exciting. Good crispy wrapper, not over-fried, with a flavorful inside. According to my BF the hot and sour soup was great. However, the entrees were really terrible. The General Tso had no spiciness at all and the sauce was very gelatinous. It was almost more like a hot and sour sauce, with almost a ketchup-y aftertaste. The breading was soft and mushy (which I guess is to be expected for delivery) but the chicken inside was super yucky. WAY overcooked, rubbery nuggets of chewy dried out chicken. I ate about three small bites and gave up. It was probably the worst GTC I ever had. And I've eaten a lot of bad General Tso's Chicken. The chow mein was edible but not what I would call good. It was almost flavorless. The veggies were ok and had more flavor than the noodles, but overall it was little more than something to chew and swallow, not really enjoy. I definitely wouldn't try this place again. I guess the quest for decent Chinese food delivery continues. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was promised by my bf that there would be lobster here!! But no, there was no lobster. I would still give it 4 stars though - the quality here is superb, and the presentation is unique.

Even still, I'd go back again. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Yogurtology-- how do I love thee, let me count the ways... 1) I love that I get to do it myself. 2) I love that there are so many different flavors to choose. 3) I love that I always end up just getting mint, vanilla and chocolate. 4) I love that there are over 30 different toppings you can add. 5) I love that I always end up just choosing coconut and baby dark chocolate chips. 6) I love that I can see how much mine weighs when I pay for it. 7) I love that it's only about 100 calories for 4 ounces. 8) I love that I can never seem to end up with less than about twice that much! 9) I love that they have really great seating inside and out (and that if they're all full, AJ's outdoor patio is just next door). 10) and I really love that they now have a ""loyalty card"" that gets you three dollars off your 9th cup.

 This place was not my bag -- to say the least. When I go to Vegas, I like to splurge and check out great restaurants. Well, I was rolling with a different crowd this time, and after a few nights of going big, we went straight WT for our last supper. My friend had seen this place on the Food Network and described it as a restaurant where they ""abuse and say mean things to you"". Hmmm, pay someone to abuse me - this should be interesting. Oohh, it was interesting alright - but nothing like I anticipated. Where do I begin.... It's in the Excalibur. I could just stop there. We got to peep the hotel scene in all its glory while waiting in the hour long line (cause this ain't no reservation-takin kinda place, y'all). It's a stand-in-a-roped-off-double-file-line-behind-a-family-of 5-sporting-matching-mullets kinda place. Let's just say - we weren't in Steve Wynn land anymore, toto. It's is a seedy dive with a chicken-wangish menu, napkins covering the floor, bras hanging from the bar, and servers who create lewd condom/KKK hats and balloon penises. Oh, and they dry hump, sing bad 80's tunes, and make foul sexual comments (all while their 300lb muffin-top is busting out of a thong *see pic*). It's a low-budget (questionable taste), Vegas-bachelorette-party-paradise. I sat back and enjoyed the shit show for what is was - but there is no chance in hell you'll catch me there again.

 OK Phoenix. I know you don't know what you don't know, but let's set a higher bar with Sushi. Here's my experience. Edamame was over cooked. That's really hard to do, but they did it. My waitress was new but didn't know whether the eel was heated, didn't know whether they had amaebi (which they didn't), and wasn't sure they made a hand roll. And hand rolls weren't even offered as an option in the menu. Hello. And finally, the spider roll was OK, but should have come out warm. And now finally, roll options were limited. Cream cheese should be offered on the Philly roll. They have cream cheese and spicy mayo as an add to all but 2 rolls. That hides bad fish. Come on now. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is Madison's living room. No, really. As I wandered in, I kind of was confused. It is like coming into a house. Not nice. No really, not nice at all. Kind of stuck in the 70's. Right now, it is packed in here and it is a Monday night. There is some big meeting in the back conference room, a knitting class behind me, tons of people studying around the place, and next to me some lady getting super frustrated at her laptop because the cd rom drive keeps making noises.

 Been in a few times, because it's close to my house. Service is spotty. Food is mediocre, and probably designed to be more enjoyable the drunker you are. My friend and I won the trivia game thing one night (the trivial girl totally came up and interrupted our conversation to tell us about it - we weren't ostensibly there for that). So, t-girl comes up and hands us the big $25 gift card for the brainiac winners, and I say, ""Looks like we're the smartest guys in the joint,"" like...not-so-serious, but in a playful way, to which she gives the most condescending look, and replies, ""I don't know about that,"" all straight-faced, turning away robotically. Wow. Creepy. Yeah, you don't know me, or the art of conversation, girlfriend. I could clean up on Jeopardy, but since you interrupted...okay, I'll play your little game. And get comped food and drinks for me and my friend in the process. Boo-yah! Anyway, my buddy gets the beef tacos and swears by them.

 I spent the better part of seven years of my life as an automotive technician at a fairly large (20+ techs) dealership, and as such fully and completely appreciate the expertise, knowledge, and service that a dealership provides. Whenever possible, I purchase parts and services from local dealerships. Yes, I could save a ton of money on parts by buying items online, but as mentioned, I respect dealerships and understand the benefits of supporting local businesses. That said, this particular VW dealership (the Zimbrick on Century Avenue is only a VW dealer, BTW - no Acura any longer at this location) shocked me with their inability to comprehend a simple request for oil, an oil filter, and a fuel filter. I called to check the price and availability for some common, everyday maintenance items for my VW Jetta. My Jetta has the 1.9L BRM Diesel motor (""PD"" style), and as such has some unique requirements as identified by Volkswagen, specifically when it comes to oil. VW mandates that you use their 505.01 approved oil in the BRM diesel motor. Failure to do so may result in a voided or compromised warranty. So imagine my shock when the parts guy told me to use ""any old oil"" while on the phone. When I tried to correct him and request the 505.01 Castrol VW oil, he seemed to get a bit unnerved. I then asked about a fuel filter, and despite having told him the make, model, year, and engine type of my VW on three separate occasions, he still misquoted my filter. I then gave him my VIN, and he was still confused. A few minutes later, he quoted me the correct filter, but at a price that was easily 2x higher than what I would pay from any other online VW parts dealer. So, I declined to purchase anything from this local resource, and will now have to shop online with an out-of-the-area dealership. I'm sorry, but my confidence was shaken immediately, and I was floored by the sky high price (they quoted $60 for the filter; everyone else is $25). ",1,0,0,0,0

 I did three stars because it really was just a-ok but clearly has the ability to be amazing. I think we probably just went on an off day and we may give it another shot if we make it back down town sometime. We had high hopes, AB has been on our radar for a bit now and it was really decent except that each dish really had one minor problem or another. Food network has turned America into a bunch of wanna be food critics who imagine themselves on the set of Chopped when ordering lunch/dinner. Look at me and ""call my guilty"" but hey, I am the one paying to go out so I can say what I want right?. Hmmm.... Location is good and the place is definitely beautiful, clean, modern, awesome. We were seated right away and had great service throughout the meal. The antipasto meat and cheese was the best thing we ate...We got the ham, blue cheese, olives and garlic...you can go through and make your plate however you want (like ordering sushi) -very clever. The bread was fantastic, grilled, warm, soft...our only complaint was the garlic had gone a little long and got that bitter taste but overall this was good (could be Great!). I ordered a strawberry lemonade...granted the server did advise after the fact that they are working to perfect the recipe, but this was nothing short of horrible. Watered down, lack of strawberry and just overall lack of flavor. $4 for this, I think not. You would be better off with pink lemonade from the coke machine...Come on Fox, I know you have a good recipe floating around somewhere, this needs help! Our server was great and took it off our bill. Okay so main dish...My wife got the famous Chinese chicken salad. It was everything it should be, fresh greens, good dressing, nice crisp won-tons except the chicken was very dry and tasted like it was prepared much earlier. I had the jambalaya which had amazing flavor but was way way way too spicy. I like heat, I'm not a spice baby either...you will find some crazy spice guy who would love you for this dish but overall you have to remember your target audience here....It was so hot I could not eat it. The sausage is amazing, the shrimp were nice and cooked perfectly, the rice was excellent...it was just lost to the spice. Burn me now, burn me later kinda dealeo. - Don't take my ramblings to suggest it was bad, it was not by any stretch....I just know how much better this team of fine individuals could, and most likely will, make it be.

 It's very rare that I'm moved to write a review and a bad one at that. Most times I just suck up and deal with any bad experiences. So... 3 weeks ago made a reservation online and called the branch 24hrs in advanced to be picked up at 9am. I gave the person the pick up address and cross st (easy to find). I'm travelling from Phoenix to West los Angeles for a 6pm appointment to time is important. I received a call at 8am the day of to confirm my pick up location and time (My apartments front office 9am). I was there waiting at 8:50 and by 9am no call no pickup. I patiently waited thinking they might have some delays. 9:15 and nothing by 9:25 I get a call stating that they are there at my office location ready to pick me up. What, why are you at my office I said. All the info I gave to rent is under my home address and I confirmed the pick up address twice. So I was finally picked up by 10am they gave me a 5% discount (saved $8) have me the car with a full tank but noted the paper work with 1/2 a tank. I returned the car with 1/2 a tank and they charged me for the other half. They adjusted the gas charges to $0. In the end I had to rush to Los Angeles non stop and just made it with 10min to spare. It would of been much better with an hour or more of time to spare. This location has me thinking twice about renting from them and enterprise in general.

I also love the dol-sot bibimbap here...the rice sizzling at the bottom of the stone pot forms into a nice crunchy crust...and if it's more starch that you want, then I'd happily recommend the seafood with green onion pancake Like all terrific Korean bbq places, the meat platters come with endless little bowls of kimchi in all its various glorious permutations...and if you can manage to plow your way though all that, they'll bring you more till you're literally rolling out of the restaurant.

 This place is literally a diamond in the rough. When I tell my friends to meet me here, they are somewhat weary of my description of how to get here. It's just north of Greenway on the west side, right across from a trailer park in a dumpy old strip mall. It's brilliant really. Let's take two of some of the best guilty pleasures: Mexican and Chinese food and mix them together! When I'm hungry and am craving food and can't make a decision, this is my go-to place, because it satiates the cravings for salty, rich, cheesy, and maybe spicy if you'd like. Oh, and sweet too! (They give you homemade Snickerdoodles with each meal!) My favorite thing to do is get the combo platter with the Emerald Chicken (so light, tender, and yummy), either Machaca beef or carnitas in a quesadilla, and the pork fried rice with black beans. As another reviewer said, go for the Jerk chicken or Pollo Diablo if you want options that are spicier. It can get confusing what to order since there's too many options, but no need to fret. They let you sample everything! You can just order one dish (i.e. Teriyaki chicken) alone with rice, or you can get the combo like the one I mentioned above so you have more choices. Ordering a meat/veggie as a quesadilla or burrito is merely an included option if you get the combo plate, but it's extra if you're only getting one meat/veggie alone. Don't forget to check out the life size Panda in a sombrero either while waiting for your food. The place can get pretty packed on weekend evenings... ",0,0,0,1,0

 Let me begin by saying that I am visiting Madison from NY and got stuck here because of Hurricane Sandy. I have been working out at the hotel and my hair, which is long, curly and tends to frizz, Is in need of attention. I tend to wear it straight but I have had really good blowout where it wasn't pin straight yet looked healthy, shiny and didn't frizz, so I realize this is possible. Ok, I needed to preface my review with all that background. I walk in this morning and explain my need for a wash and blowout. They were nice. They said they were booked today (Halloween) and he even offered to have my hair done by his assistant. So far so good. I was even excited because they use Bumble and Bumble. Great. Then I asked if they flat iron hair. Because the salons on the East coast generally know that hair like mine will frizz seconds after a blowout unless they seal the cuticle with good product and a hot iron. They said they don't have one. He said the one he had broke. What?! They are booked solid today and the only hot iron they had is broken??? Well, I ran from there because that tells me one of two things. The lesser evil a) they just didn't want to deal with my special hair care needs on a busy day...fine. or worse, b) they really don't have except the one ,recently broken, hot iron. Which means if you have curly or frizzy hair, they are probably not used to dealing with your kind of hair. So this review is for anyone with this sort of hair that might be considering them. It may be unfair of me but I wouldn't trust it. Gonna try another Madison salon and will review them later. ",0,1,0,0,0

 What an average dinner. T Cooks is in a beautiful hotel and has a great atmosphere. Not much else to offer. As a disclaimer, I had fairly high expectations considering the caliber of restaurant. The salads were mediocre at best. For the meal, I had the filet which had to be one of the worst filets I've ever had. My coworkers had the bison ribeye, and said it was good, probably would recommend that if you do go to the restaurant. One bright spot - the marscapone mashed potatoes, some of the best mashed potatoes I have ever had. The dessert was seriously lacking. I had a layer cake with peanut butter in it, I seriously thought that it came out of a Hostess box (no offense to Twinkies), it was the most bland and uninspiring dessert I have had in a long time. One coworker had a banana dessert that looked great, but no guarantees.... Lastly, they just redid their wine list, eliminating many of the upper end wines. Not that I'm a frequenter of the Reserve List, but if you're going for a special occasion or on a business dinner, you'll be out of luck. If you are staying at the Royal Palms, it is convenient. But I wouldn't venture more than a mile to eat here. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have a love hate relationship with this place. I feel like it depends on the group of people I go with. Once I went with my boyfriend and instead of giving us any sushi that was on our order guide, they gave us all the a la carte items first and then started giving us one sushi order at a time slowly. I felt like they were trying to get us full fast on purpose. I've also gone with a certain group of co-workers who are loud, obnoxious and fun to be around, and that's when I get the best service. I feel like the more livelier your group is, depending on your waitress, you get exceptional service so they can work a better tip out of you. Not only that, they've also given us extra plates of dessert ""secretly"" or let us ""hide"" food so we don't get charged. There was also one time where we paid with credit cards, but we left a cash tip. Later to find out that they added a number to the tip line and charged us more tip for each person. Wtf. And my last gripe is the plate size for these little portions of food. I love that when they bring out food, it is extremely fast. But the problem is, the plates are so large and unnecessary, it fills up the table completely way too fast and you have no room to work with. The only thing this place has going for itself is the food. It's not the best I've eaten, but it's bearable compared to other places I've been to. I go here only with the certain group of co-workers on occasion and also because it is nearby where I live. This place is mediocre at best and so is the service. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Carolinas is an institution in Phoenix, hands down. They make their own tortillas in the restaurant, and they are the best you'll ever have! They literally melt in your mouth, also try the butter tortilla, its the best carb overload you'll ever have. A few other good things to try here: Machaca burrito or taco Bean and cheese burritos Tostadas! Red and green chile In all honesty anything you get here will be good. Don't be turned off by the area, its not that bad at all. The worst parts of town are over west of the 17 and further west of central, like way further west! Minus one star because their hours are fucking terrible. They close at 7 or 8, and they're not open on Sundays. This makes it a pain in the ass to get to on a weekday, since I'm coming from Tempe.

 I was hankering for a good fish dish a la Vera Cruz and decided to try out Mimita's Cuban Cafe since a friend had recommended it. It's sad to say that I was very disappointed with their food. I ordered the Filete de Pescado al Ajo with Moros. Needless to say, aside from the butt load of crushed garlic enough to scare off the vampires on Halloween, the food was bland underneath all that garlic. The only thing that was enjoyable was the Maduros. But it's pretty tough to mess up fried plantain. I don't see me going back there, nor recommending it to my friends and family...and they call themselves The Best Cuban Food in Town, yuck! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Close by and pretty darn good! Pho Rancho you had me at Hello. If you and I are friends, you already know I'm overly excited we have a pho restaurant in our neck of the woods now! Yes, driving to Spring Mountain was very inconvenient but there really wasn't any other choice for good Vietnamese food nearby. I'm glad to say I can now get my pho fix in North Vegas. And there's one thing you should know about me, I am a Pho snob. So I wasn't expecting it to be as good as my beloved Pho Saigon but what a pleasant surprise for me that it's a very close second. So delicious and not to mention kid approved. The restaurant itself is very clean, equipped with flat screens which are usually set to the food network. The portions could be a tad bigger but the prices are fair and the staff is very friendly. They will refill your drinks before you happen to notice your glass is half empty (or half full if your the optimistic type). And I also like how they come by periodically to remove empty plates, you don't usually see this type of service at other Vietnamese restaurants. They definitely have the right idea and will stand out from the bunch. Making sure customers are happy is the best way to ensure they will be back and often. Case and point, the restaurant just opened in November and I've been back twice and that is only the beginning. 4 solid stars. ; ) PhoLife. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Fresh and healthful food make this place a go-to in my book! Needed a quick dinner around 8pm but didn't want to eat too heavy. We decided to try zikiz. I had a salad with chicken as my protein and the zikiz dressing, which was fantastic. A light vinaigrette that was delicious and refreshing. The ingredients were fresh. My husband had a rice bowl and LOVED it. He told them just to put a little of their homemade dressing and but raved about it and said he wished he let them put more on because it was so good. You can also get wraps and hummus bowls, which I'm sure we'll try some other time. Friendly service, bright and clean restaurant, fair prices. I'll be back here for sure! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I see a lot of good reviews for the pizza here, which we have never tried. This review is for the sandwiches on their menu. First, it took 30 minutes for them to make two sandwiches; an Italian beef called the Cheef, and an Italian cold sub. The Cheef was soggy and did not taste good. It was also not very warm. The au jus served with it was like a pepper gravy, nothing like au jus. The Italian combo was barely mediocre. The meat was not fresh tasting, nor was the lettuce or tomato. The bread on both items was hard. Overall, we were not happy with the food quality. I should mention that we went to this same location a few years ago, and had a very similar experience. We decided to give it another shot last night, and we will not be back. The pizza may very well be great, we'll probably never know. They should focus on that and drop the sandwich category from their menu. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I give it 2 stars because the food was good. We had the fried pickles and the BBQ nachos. They were both appetizers. That being said, those appetizers took 25 minutes to get to us. We sat at the bar for a couple beers and a quick bite and were greeted by a bartender who seemed less than pleased that we were there in the first place, and also didn't seem to care at all that we were waiting so long for food. There were people around us who ordered entrees that came out before our appetizers so I'm not sure if our ticket was lost or if the bartender forgot to ring it in, but he didn't even acknowledge the long wait time until we brought it up. Nothing was done to rectify the situation, no manager spoke to us, and the bartender just sort of walked away when we were telling him how long it was taking. Very rude. He could have at least humored us or showed some sympathy. Needless to say, there are plenty of good restaurants in Vegas with the same quality of food, so definitely skip this place when you're in town. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is awesome. It's a nice chill spot after getting off work late and hanging out with friends. I love most of their warm milk teas, especially the almond milk tea. Actually, I pretty much like all of their milks teas, cold and warm. The staff pretty much leaves you alone except when you first get there (which is understandable). Their tactics for getting you to order instantly is a little intimidating I will admit. They just stand behind you until you're ready to order -_- I like how they place all of the teas on the shelves for everyone to see. It adds color and ambience to the place. I am already a regular and will continue to be one. Side note: I was iffy about coming here the first time because one of my close friends told me that she came here and hated it. She ordered regular boba drinks (not totally sure which ones) and almost all of her friends puked. My experience was nothing like this. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The food was okay, but quite expensive for what it was. The service, however, was awful. We had to stop 3 separate servers multiple times just to get our drinks. Half our tables food showed up 20 minutes prior to the second half. We had to ask for napkins and silverware. To add insult to injury we had to walk our check to the hostess after waiting over 10 minutes for our server to take it (she must have walked by 4 times). ",0,1,0,0,0

 The appeal of Market Street Kitchen is 5 stars! Perfect area, perfect outdoor seating, perfect ambience. Sadly, the food and service didn't match. I wanted it to be great because it is so dang cute. Bottomless Mimosas for $10 is the only reason I would be back. Food: Chicken chilaquilas were not what I expected. I have a hard time liking something when it veers from the traditional style. If it's not broke don't fix it...right?! This wasn't bad but it wasnt great! Small and more of a bake then a casserole, which is what chilaquilas are. Eggs Benedict were very very undercooked, sauce was extremely thick, and worst of all it was cold! Once we told the server he brought back another batch. The eggs were still undercooked and the temperature went up about 1 notch. Pet peeve: When sides are not included! We got tator tots. They were good and you could share them, but its not a 5 star restaurant and its not dinner time. Lunch should include sides... Just my opinion. Service: Ehh. The manager didn't even say anything when he brought over our second batch. When we tried asking for extra plates and silverware they walked away and never came back. We had to ask the hostess for help. Not cool. Service: 2 stars ",0,1,0,0,0

 I really don't understand all the hype about Cora. It is an over-priced breakfast place with nothing more than your typical breakfast options. The wait was long. It must've been 10 minutes before the waitress even brought the menus. I had the French toast with fruits. Nothing impressive. I tried my husband's omelet and it was ordinary at best. The meal did not bring me more satisfaction than a bagel & coffee at Tim Horton's, but it certainly cost a lot more. And considering how much time I spent driving there and back and waiting for my food, I probably could've whipped up a better breakfast on my own. I guess Cora is a place for people who have lots of free time in the morning and don't mind spending up to 20 bucks on breakfast. ",0,1,0,0,0

 for the ambiance and idea behind this coffee shop, i give it two stars. it's cute, they have a nice espresso machine. the espresso was bitter. i paid $3.00 for 3 shots. i added my sugar and half and half at the some what dirty side bar (mostly drips and sugar crystals about, but dried liquid, so it had been there a while). about 3 sips into the drink, i got a huge clot of half and half that must have fallen into my cup from the container as i poured it. i couldn't bring myself to drink much more, i took the lid off and sipped it, but it was not that great, so i threw it away. i don't know if i would try this again, seeing as the major part that sells me on a coffee place is the quality of coffee, and the cleanliness of the place.

 It was probably the 2 week incessant Christmas music playing at the casinos where my husband and I work that caused us to become disgusted with the whole notion of Christmas. With that being said, we hoped into our car and decided to have Christmas eve dinner in China Town. We were in the mood for Thai food and stumbled across Marnee Thai. Upon entering, I felt as if we were starring in our own Wild West movie, because everyone literally stopped what they were doing to turn around and look at us. Acting natural, we ordered some appetizers off the menu, the ""beef jerky"" was a little dry but after a few bites grew to like it. It was like Thai carnitas! Seafood Salad was a little too spicy for me and found the imitation crab, off-putting. Finally the ""Stuffed Chicken Wings"" were okay but had a weird coating. Over all the service and the food were all kind of Meh. Go for an entree and skip the apps. Oh, and don't sit under the karaoke television monitor, which when we were there was on the wall over our table. As I was eating I felt like people were watching me, and they kind of were because they were watching the monitor which was about a foot above my head. I still consider this personal space.

 For the price, you can't beat it, since the only other conveyor belt sushi places are in Tempe or LA. It's mediocre at best for sushi standards, but hey, it's F-U-N. A couple sake bombers and you'll be good to go! :) I would recommend sitting near the front sushi bar along the right hand side if you want to see what's the freshest. Also I always order a bunch of assorted hand rolls @ $2 ea right off the bat. Then it gets made fresh just for you! and just supplement with a few other things that catch your eye on the belt. Unless you've seen it be put down, it may be a little old. Even sushi that's been sitting for 15 minutes does not make me a happy camper. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The toong tong was a decent appetizer and the pad ke-mao was a good entree, but the pak rad kang (with chicken added) was a disappointment. All in all, the food was fine. Not special, but not terrible either. This rating would've been higher--that is, 3 or even 4 stars--had the service come a little closer to living up to the hype in other reviews. As it was, we had a 7pm reservation and were seated promptly upon arrival, but no one came to our table for a full 20-25 minutes after being seated, despite several tables sitting empty (and uncleaned) around us. Had the place been full, it would've been more understandable. But it was kind of ridiculous how good they were at ignoring us as we pleaded nonverbally for at least a strong beverage to pass the time. Incidentally, when it came time for the check, they were very attentive all of a sudden. ",0,1,0,0,0

 They made my Portuguese Water Dog look horrible. They actually sheared all the fur from my dog claiming that it was matted and therefore they had no choice. This isn't true as I personally brush my dog every morning. When I complained, the owner said: ""But we did tell you that we will cut the dog's fur short."" Yes, they did, and I thought that considering that the days are hot in August, they are proposing a little cooler grooming. I never expected them to just shear the dog to the skin. I think they did it because they are hopelessly irresponsible. Although they charged $70 for this brutally simple operation they have not even trimmed dog's ears and tail. Consequently, the dog has disproportionally long hair on its tail and the ears. I used Animal Elegance for more than a decade. Long before current management took over. Over all these years I sometimes took in stride their accessional compromise of standards and always paid their exorbitant prices without complaint. However, this fragrant negligence, combined with their total disregard of the fact that I was an old and loyal customer did it. I will avoid this place from now on and would like to suggest that you do the same. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This place is amazing! Tucked away in the same plaza as starbucks and CVS, it's convenient on the way from work. Clean facility. Love the simple, fun decor. I didn't need to wait at all to get my eyebrows done. I was a little nervous trying a new eyebrow threading place. Prices are super affordable. If you're doing just eyebrows, it is only $9. Make sure to get a stamp card and you'll get your 7th free! Very clever idea! My eyebrows came out perfect. Natural, slim, and lovely. What sets this place apart is the service!! For real. I'm very used to other threading establishments with unfriendly ladies threading my eyebrows, which isn't a huge deal to me, but they normally look displeased or upset. Normally I go to the $5 salons at select Eyebrows R Us through the valley, but their service has been unfriendly, and unspectacular compared to here! I don't know if it is the company itself or the culture maybe, but this has been type of visit I grew accustomed to. The attitude here is completely different. The ladies were happy, thankful, friendly, and knew more english than previous places I had been to. Communication skills are awesome if you have any issues with your threading service. Definitely makes me want to come back. I usually have to go long distances to get my brows done and to save a bit extra, but Javal is so close, clean, quick, and the ladies are so nice! I will definitely be back! This is my new go-to eyebrow emergency center. ",0,0,0,0,1

Eventually we did get the other half, after those who got their food were finished. The quality of the food was awful. The server forgot the second round twice. We had to go up to the bar and wait about 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us to give us our tab. At the bar there were other people complaining about the poor service.

 Looks like I'm one of the few guests who wasn't ""dazzled"" by this resort, which I suppose is a good thing. We stayed there for just one night (thankfully!) in early summer and I can definitely say it will be the last time. The rooms were halfway decent, but only somewhat better than a $39 Howard Johnson. There were so many coats of paint on the wall the doors didn't close properly, and my room had an unrestricted view of the parking lot, even though we'd specifically requested (and were promised) a room overlooking the pool area. As I've come to expect from high-dollar, low value hotels, this place wanted to nickel and dime me to death. I mean seriously, they charged $6 for a $0.99 bottle of water, and then if that wasn't insulting enough, in very small print, revealed a $2 ""Restocking"" fee... whatever the hell that is, so all in all, you were afforded the opportunity to spend $8 on a lousy bottle of water. Oh and then there was the wireless internet. You know, the same internet that is free at Marriotts, Hiltons, and other reputable hotels? No, at this dive, they wanted $19.95 per day for the privilege of using the internet. If you wanted to use the business center, they'd only charge you $10 for 10 minutes. How generous of them. In hindsight tho, it's probably a good thing we didn't have a pool view because the pool area was disgusting. There was trash and sand all over the place, the pools were filthy and cloudy and smelled of urine, and half of the poolside furniture was broken. All this can be yours for the bargain basement price of $129 per night! IN THE SUMMER!! Never again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Once again I found this place entirely based on a Yelp search. You will not see this place from the street, but it is worth searching out. I've done happy hour with the family downstairs and I've done a Friday night happy hour upstairs with adults. You just can't find this in AZ. The upstairs patio is amazing. What a great place to hang out. I'm not quite sure what will happen in the dead of summer as this place is almost entirely outdoors, but we will figure that out when the time comes. As of right now the upstairs and the restaurant are amazing around dusk. The only thing holding it back from my 5th star is that the upstairs does not offer the same beer selection as downstairs. Its entirely different. So basically I found myself going downstairs to get a selection of their awesome local craft beer selection and then going back upstairs. There is a nice bar upstairs, but perhaps in the future they need to find a way to offer the same drafts upstairs as downstairs. FYI upstairs is 21 and over after 3pm. I'm loving Chandler downtown!

 To review Las Vegas buffets I've broken it down into 4 sections. Appetizers: Nice selection. Cravings claim to fame is their new sections of global cuisine. You can have some nice appetizers to entrees from each section. Salads: Very nice salad section. They will make custom salads to your order. Main Entree: They have many worldly selections representing from China, Mexico, Japan, Italy and more.. Some are better than others but the variety is good and quality is above average. Desserts: Since Cravings breaks everything out into their own sections, they have a decent dessert section as well. Most are mass manufactured goods and some are custom, like the gelato. I was torn to give them 3.5 or 4 stars, but decided to round it off to 4 stars since they deserve something better than a 3. So if you have any ""Cravings"" for worldly cuisine, this is a good place to go. Decor: 4 Stars (its been refreshed since the original opening) Service: 3 Stars (decent staff) Atmosphere: 3 Stars (its okay) Food Quality: 4 Stars (good quality) Quantity of Food: 5 Stars (its all you can eat) Price: 4 Stars (almost worth the high price) For a Grand Total of 4 Stars.

The food is fine, nothing special. A couple sandwiches are better than average, a couple worse. Overall it is overpriced for what you get. But let's get to the real problem: this place is a terribly run restaurant. My experience today is rather typical. I go in and order at sandwich to carry out at about 2:30pm. So it's after the lunch rush and not extremely busy. And I wait for 14 minutes for my sandwich!! While I'm waiting I start to fume a bit as I make some observations. I count NINE employees currently working (and maybe more in the back I couldn't see). That's a heck of a lot of staff for a soup and sandwich shop with no table service that isn't even that busy. But here's the real kicker: I counted SEVEN tickets while I was waiting. That means there were two more people working than there were orders, and it still took me 14 minutes to get a sandwich. There is something very wrong with that. Most of the problem was obvious, the majority of the staff seemed to be wandering around behind the counter not exactly sure what they were doing, not at a particular assigned station, and moving really quite slowly on whatever task they were attempting to figure out. It's sandwiches, not haute cuisine. It should be fast, efficient, and good. And just because the staff looked mostly like college kids and 20 somethings is no excuse. The campus pub I used to work at was all 19year olds in the kitchen and with a little training, three of them could crank out solid food at about five times the rate of Eat Unique with a much more complex menu including a flattop and fryer. My suggestion to the owners/managers: fire half your staff (which should allow you to lower your prices), and get 3-4 solid line cooks that know what they're doing and how to work in a kitchen. I guarantee your business will improve when people don't have to wait 20min for a sandwich and a cup of soup. ",1,0,0,0,0

 After driving by 25 times or so I decided to drop in & try some cupcakes finally. The girl working the counter was bubbly, knowledgeable, & helpful. I selected 4 different cupcakes. A wedding cake, midnight chocolate chip, Peanut Butter Cup, & a Red Velvet one. Like a lot of desserts, they were quite appealing to the eye. They were very pretty cupcakes. To my disappointment the cake itself was dry & not very flavorful. I've had much better cake from a Betty Crocker box, honestly. The frostings were good, but quite excessive. I like frosting a lot & I couldn't finish it all. Lastly, the were overpriced in my opinion. $15 & some change for 4! If I'm going to pay that much, I'll just go to Sprinkles. I really wanted to like this place :-( ",0,1,0,0,0

 I had to come back to Bachi Burger again after enjoying it so much last May. It definitely has shot up my ranks as one of my favorite burger joints in Vegas. Because their menu has a pretty extensive selection of Burgers and Bites to choose from, it makes it already a tough decision on what to order. Same thing happened to me last time where it took me at least a good 15 mins to decide before finally picking the Ronin Burger. At least this time I came super hungry so I was ready to tackle at least one burger and one of their epic sides. I ended up ordering their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Kiki's Burger. Mini Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries -- http://bit.ly/1bwHmls Luckily for me, I came in during their happy hour so they had it available in ""Mini"" size. Mini?? Whatever! This thing was a beast!!! Essentially, it's a poutine with a fried egg on top. They definitely didn't skimp on the Oxtail Chili. It was loaded! And so good!! It was a great way to start my meal before my burger arrived at the table. Kiki's Burger -- http://bit.ly/1bF4H8O Angus Beef, Saut \ u00e9ed Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli Just by that ingredient list you can already see there's a lot going on with this burger. But it all works! So much flavor coming from the mushrooms and cheese, and the burger was cooked perfectly and it too had nice flavor as well. This probably beats the Ronin Burger by a mile and I'm sad to say that because I was so sold on the Ronin being one of my favorite burgers of all time. It was pretty much a perfect burger! The sad part about Bachi Burger that also makes me mad is that I can only have one burger per visit. In a perfect world I'd be able to eat everything off the menu in one visit but obviously that's not going to happen. I definitely would like to try their Shogun Burger, Gyutan Sliders, and Steamed Buns. So I'm pretty sure that I'll be coming back again to try more of their awesome Burgers and Bites. Bachi Burger has done it again! 5 solid stars!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place is pretty cool. Especially for amature golfers like my self. Being in a desert type golf course, in a cool 73-77 degree, sunny and breezy weather with couple of my best friends made this experience awesome. The people that take care of the guest are super friendly. Really easy going and patient staff. One thing I hate are stuck up staff members who work at a course, just so they can play for free. These were not those people. From the point at the Bag Drop Off, to registration, to the Cart Pick Up, to the first tee; every single person that worked there were really helpful and kind. While we were waiting for our tee time, the guy at the first tee informed us about the way the courses all ran and what to watch out for. He was really funny and seemed to love his job a lot. They had food and drink carts going around. They even put ice and water bottles in our cooler for us. Gave us towels and tees. I'm sure this all went with the course fees. They also had Food and drink stands at the 5th and 15th hole. That was good, cus I was starving after the first 9. The prices were not the usual Las Vegas prices (thank God!). I got what I thought at that moment was the ""best"" hot dog EVER. It was just a regular hot dog. ",0,0,0,0,1

 As I may have mentioned before, I am forever on a quest here in Charlotte for a great pizza pie. Knowing that Jet's has a deep dish pizza, I was quite excited to try it (especially since I had a Groupon to do so cheaply). However, Jet's wasn't quite my cup of tea, so I will continue my quest. My partner and I decided to try the Jet 10 pizza in deep dish and the Jet's Bread. The bread used the same dough as the deep dish pizza, I am relatively certain. However, the bread just didn't have enough garlic on it for my taste, so it was mostly just dough and cheese. I really did not care for the marinara sauce there at all, as it was a very sweet marinara. I am not at all a fan of sweet marinara sauces, so if you like them on the sweet side, this one is probably pretty good. The bread itself was mildly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, so it had a good texture. The portion size on the bread was pretty generous for the money, so that was good. Not very often do you find places that have a square deep dish pizza. You can't really see the outside crust, as the toppings go all the way out to the corners. I was pretty excited about that. I liked the variety of toppings on the Jet 10. However, Jet's suffers from the same downfall of pizza chain deep dish in that it was mostly dough and easy on the toppings. Again, their pizza sauce was a little too sweet for my taste, but if you like the sweet sauce at Pizza Hut (think big New Yorker or the stuffed crust), you will probably love the sauce. I know that you can normally pick a flavor for the crust, but my impression was that you could not get that on the deep dish. I am honestly not sure about that. Now, dining in here is pretty great, I will say. Our bread sticks came out in about 10 minutes, and they served them on a metal platter on a stand. It was all very nice looking. Our pizza came about 5 minutes later, also on a platter and stand. The dining area was clean and not terribly cluttered at this location, which was great. The employees were friendly and quick. If you like a sweeter sauce on your pizza, I am guessing that you might appreciate this place a little more than I did. Our pizza was hot, fresh, and decent. However, I am still holding out for a more perfect pizza place in the Queen City. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Some yoked out guido accidentally punched me in the head. He was trying to hit a guy , missed, and got me instead.

 We've ordered from Geno's several times now and for the prices you pay it's decent pizza for the price. I like the seasoned crust. My favorite choice here is The Italian - pepperoni, ham, salami and pepperoncinis. Also, try ordering a Geno's large pizza and throw some bacon on it (for you carnivores out there). Wings are decent - not the best I've ever had, but not bad. I like the hot and hot bbq the best. Wife likes the garlic parmesan wings. Next time around I will probably try one if their toasted subs. The Italian and Steak & Cheese sound pretty good. When you call in an order, a lot of times they will give you the coupon discount or tell you about the monthly special, even if you don't know about them. I had to downgrade my rating for Geno's since I wrote my first review because of two experiences that I had picking up orders. On one trip to get our pizza we found that it had apparently been sitting there for quite some time - much earlier than we were told, so basically we had slightly warmed pizza. Last week it happened again, except this time I walked in to pickup at the time they indicated it would be ready and was told our pizzas should ready in another 5-10 more minutes. After waiting 15, I asked someone, figuring our order might have been lost. What they discovered was that our order had been ready all along on the waiting rack and they missed it. So once again slightly warmed pizza. It seems that other customers here share similar experiences with orders that are not ready at the pickup time provided. C'mon Geno's - you need to get your act together... ",0,1,0,0,0

 We went here for a large group function, and the indoor/outdoor environment was nice, and it was easy to mingle. The served some apps of chips and guac and they were good. The entree and salad, not so much. We definitely didn't come here for the food, it was less than mediocre, however, we were a big group and serving in that volume can tax the best kitchens.

The people working were unfriendly, bordering rude (cashier, cook, and one other person who all spent more time joking and laughing with each other). My salad had the large stem/base in it, ugh. 2 of the girls in our group ordered pretzels and were waiting by the pick-up window for a good 10 minutes before someone in our group asked how much longer it would be only to be informed that they were out of pretzels.....was anybody going to tell them?!?

 I was referred to Tracy, owner of Exclusive Paint and Auto Body in 1991 after they did an excellent job repairing some damage to a friends new vehicle. He was so impressed with how professional and reasonable Tracy was that when my my BMW was damaged, that is the first place I went to. After comparing bids of two other shops, I selected Exclusive. The price was very fair, they are friendly and professional and I knew they did excellent work. Since then I have referred him out with confidence and Tracy did body work on my Range Rover, two Mercedes Benz and a Volvo. He has repaired my mothers car too. As i write this review, I am waiting for a call back from Tracy...again to repair some light damage I did to the hood of my current vehicle. For over 21 years I have known Tracy and trusted his work, I am confident that he will take care of the job again. A few years ago I was fortunate enough to meet his brothers and other family members in another business transaction....all just as professional and friendly as Tracy. I am confident that you will feel fortunate to have met and done business with Exclusive Auto Body. I have watched Tracy interact with both women and men equally, fairly and professionally in his shop...there are very few shops that I could say that about. Douglas Eggleston ",0,0,0,0,1

 When I first visited Brazilian Sensation there must have been some sort of party. It was the evening, the place was packed, and whatever was happening it had a carnival atmosphere. Despite the odds I found a seat. The result was a wonderful evening. Brazilian Sensation offers something a little different. A friendly, family owned restaurant that serves real Brazilian snacks and meals. The whole place has an authentic feel, and you get the impression the owners care. It can get a little crowded at the best of times, lunch time tends to be much quieter. You will always feel welcome and relaxed. I didn't recognise the menu much when I first visited but I would definitely recommend the homemade tropical fruit ice cream, especially on a summer's day. Prices are standard for Edinburgh and portions are a good size. Reservations are essential from 5pm onwards. Keep in mind that credit cards are not accepted. For a different flavour of restaurant, try Brazilian Sensation! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Wow, how the LA counterpart allows this place to keep using the Pink's name is beyond me. The first time I went when it opened I was like meh. The second time I went last month I was like wth!!! I don't see this place lasting with it never having people there it seems. The chili is pretty spot on to being the same as well as the dogs but man everything else is just horrible. I mean I got a crusted tortilla wrapper that was litterarly cracking and breaking as if it was a cracker. It's almost like they left the tortilla sitting on the counter all night and decided to use it anyways. I mean if you are going to bring a prized LA landmark like this to LA then do it right. I mean In-N-Out and Tommy's do it right. It's just a downright shame for Pink's. ",1,0,0,0,0

 A good value for your money. Considering the aggravation of dealing with traffic, parking, and cost of gas; it's worth the money! My wife and I found a deal on Groupon, where we saved $6.00 per person. This is a great tour for someone who's interested in photography! It gives you an Angle, which you could never get by foot, or car. It's a hop on hop off tour, so you can see all of the main tourist attractions, in one day. The tour guides are informative, friendly, and always willing to take your picture. The only downfall is the web site. We spent an hour in our room, trying to figure out how to get on the tour. The site is not iPhone friendly, the only phone number we found, directed us to The Paris. Finding our stop was almost impossible. So we lost a lot of time trying to get on the tour.

Walk around and you'll at least leave with a laugh. The other half the store are practical items, from books to paintings to kitchen gear to jewelry and much more.

 Holy God, I should have checked the reviews before eating here. Because of my tragic inability to read a map, I apparently walked to the completely wrong end of the Atrium in search of Salsaritas. Near some other unsavory selections, this seemed to be the quick & easy choice. I'm no stranger to food court Chinese. In fact, I used to look forward to stopping in the mall with mom and brother to cheaply nibble on the toothpicked free samples of sweet & sour chicken before buying a plate and splitting it three-ways. Americanized Chinese food is comfort food in a way. Dependable, affordable, tasty. This was none of those things. I went for the two-item dish which comes with rice (no white rice or brown rice option; only fried). I chose General Tso's and Beef & Broccoli. Both were dished up in IDENTICAL sauces. Let's call it Brown Sauce. Brown Sauce has no flavor. And it's cornstarched to hell, so it's thick and blubbery like day-old gravy. Brown Sauce has no business being on General Tso's Chicken. Brown Sauce made me embarrassed FOR my food. I ended up dumping half my meal... and I never do that. I love CLT's classy atrium, but can't recommend this dining option. If you need me, I'm brushing up on my cartography. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My friends wanted Mexican food for dinner and although I was in the mood for sushi, I went along with there suggestion. We sat in the front area with a view of the mall area and viewed all the rowdy drunks coming in from the pool area. I wanted to sit inside to experience the restaurant, but we were already seated. Started out with some tasty chips, salsa and ordered the $13 table side guacamole. The combination fajita isn't on the menu, but if you request it, you will get it and pay dearly. It was $42, yes you read that right. The plate was huge and sizzling with veggies, steak, chicken, and shrimp. It also comes with tortillas, rice, beans, lettuce, tomato, guacamole and sour cream. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, shrimps were huge and tasty, but the chicken super dry. Are waiter was super nice and even brought me an extra $4.50 soda before I even took a sip of the first one. I told our waiter Leo that the chicken was too dry and he asked what he could do to make it better. I asked for a couple more shrimps and he delivered 3 more. My total bill was $53.00 which is pricy for Mexican food, but the food was mostly good and the service excellent! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I went into SuperPawn this morning hoping to get a small loan and there was a woman behind the counter helping another patron. I must've been a ghost because I wasn't even acknowledged. A simple good morning ma'am I will be right with you would've been just fine. So I waited for about 5 to 7 minutes until she finished with the customer. Another woman comes from the storage area and doesn't speak to me either but it appeared that she may have smiled, it was so slight I can't really be sure. So when it was my turn to approach her, I felt like I was being intrusive. Instead of a hello I got ""so what is that a tv?"" WTF really? So I opened my box to show my merchandise and unbeknownst to me the cable outlet was broken so she couldn't check the connection. She says oh I can't take that and brushes me off and walks away. So that's fine I understood, so as I'm putting my things back in the box she is rushing me and I say don't close my box I'm still putting my stuff together.

 This Indonesian food cart is AMAZING. Not only one of my favorite food carts, but easily one of the top lunch options in the entire city in my opinion. Today I saw it outside as I went to work and it made my day! It is right in front of St. Paul's on Library Mall. I've tried both the curry tofu and the oseng tahu (candlenut tofu) and both were fantastic! They were both served with a vegetable mix and then spooned with extra sauce over a bed of fluffy, perfectly cooked rice. I would say probably a 3:1 or 3:2 tofu to vegetable ratio. -The curry tofu was coconut-based and very mild, sweet, and mellow. A large pinch of toasted coconut added some texture and heightened the complexity just a touch more. -Of the two tofus, though, I prefer the oseng tahu. It is a dish that has a bit more bite - not spicy, but that I think it strikes a less sweet note and more of an earthy one. I've never personally tried any of the other dishes, but I've heard great things about the Ayam bakar, which is barbequed chicken breast in a peanut sauce. NOTE: Be sure to take advantage of the condiments next to the forks! The hot sauce is great if you enjoy your food spicier and the sweet soy-based one is also delicious and would likely be a great accompaniment to the dishes with a thicker-looking peanut sauce to thin it out. All the entrees come with acar, which is a lightly picked vegetable salad, and krupuk, which are crunchy tapioca puffs. Both are very tasty and add a refreshing crunch. Personally, I like to pile my extra rice and sauce on the the krupuk when I am done with my tofu. The owner is super friendly, clearly there are several vegan options, everything seems to be gluten-free. I am *racking* my brain and I cannot think of a single reason to not send ALL of you here. Seriously, just go. You won't regret it! ",0,0,0,0,1

 After three months back in Charlotte, husband and I finally hit up Ru San's this weekend. We'd heard some good things, mostly from the vegetarian blogs and yelpers, and we weren't disappointed. It was about 8:00 on a Friday night, and the place was hopping - luckily, though, the patio was half empty so we got a table quickly enough. I have to say I was relieved; although the idea of ""diner sushi"" (as my husband called the inside atmosphere) seems cool, the inside was louder and less subdued than I prefer. Sitting outside, at least we could hear ourselves think. Our server was adorable, a young Asian American guy with a super emo haircut and an impish grin. The sushi could have been shit, and I think I would have still enjoyed myself because of him. Happily, however, the sushi was pretty decent, mostly because of the large list of vegetarian maki. We ordered five rolls - the spinach, pickled radish, tempura tofu, sweet tofu, and dried cranberry - and they were all tasty. Husband preferred the tempura tofu, and I thought the sweet tofu was the best. We also ordered an appetizer of their veggie dumplings, which were served with a spicy garlicky dipping sauce that was out of this world. Husband had a beer, and I had wine, and the tab still ran under $40. For a nice night on a patio with some totally edible sushi, I'll take it. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This review is for the hotel only. I've stayed on various properties along the strip and this has been my favorite for a few very important reasons: Decor, cost, and location. Location: Mandalay bay, Palazzo, and the Wynn are too far -- Since you don't spend a lot of time in your room anyway (and you shouldn't), it's really nice being in the middle of the strip and close to every major attraction. The forum shops attached to Caesars is one of my favorite places to shop! What a winner! Decor: There's a cheesy roman theme here, but it's now gaudy like the Monte Carlo and the rooms are actually very nice. It's an interesting place to be, and definitely one of the newer hotels. More importantly, it's also very clean. Price: This is the kicker for me. You have your standard marbled sinks, heated floors, and jacuzzi tubs in a basic room. Anything else around the Caesars Palace price range does not get you anything better. ",0,0,0,1,0

What we got - DELICIOUS and HUGE desserts, yes a little pricey, but based on how large they were, it was worth it. The croissant was UNBELIEVABLE. I may just be a high end croissant newb, but this was by far the best croissant I've ever had. The crust was super crispy and flaky, with a light glaze over the top and the inside was pure fluff. If you like grocery store croissants now, then this will ruin you forever. I've had croissants at ""fancy"" bakeries before, but this was soo good it deserves its own paragraph in my short review. As you read this on your phone deciding whether or not to try it, DON'T think, just GO TRY IT NOW! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Every time we go to this location they're slow. Ordered two sandwiches from the to go sandwich counter. Only customer in line and it took the kid over 20 minutes. We went to check out in the express 15 item or less line and it took about 15 or 20 minutes for him to check out 3 people with credit cards and cash ready. I watched people leave my line, go into the regular lines and still beat me out the store. The clerk obviously did not care it was written all over his face. Went another time and just had to get something from the customer service counter and waited 7 to 10 minutes before I asked if anyone was working the counter and they finally sent someone my way about another 5 minutes later. Again people behind left in anger about the wait. Great store but the slowest staff and it's every time we go. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Citizen bank Is the worst bank I have ever had in the United States of America. I moved to Pittsburgh a few months ago from another state. I could not find my Chase bank in Pittsburgh , so I decided to choose Citizens. I had some money in my previous bank Account and I want to transfer it to my citizen account. The person who works in citizens bank lied And cheated me. Since I am in USA for college and do not know most of rules , the employee told me you can transfer all your Money and your previous bank would not charge you and we also would not charge you. unfortunately , 2 days later my Chase bank charged me 3% present of that transaction , few days later , I closed my bank account at citizen . Now I am with PNC bank and I am very happy . Honest is important Shame on you citizen bank ",1,0,0,0,0

 i had high hopes for this place, and with a premise like that you know how this review will go. I wanted their chicken & waffles to shine, and my husband looked forward to corn beef hash. It arrived in a timely fashion, pretty and huge. My plate was stacked high with a knife stabbing the chicken K fried leeks all over. The leeks made it look like bushcut grass flew on my plate. The chicken was moist, but the breading had absolutely no taste. Salt & pepper was missing. The waffle was creative, but very chewy. The dried grass (leeks) didn't belong. As for the hash, they hid literally black potatoes underneath the meat. The eggs arrived slightly cold, and bland. Unfortunately it is all hype. Don't waste your money. Our 2 meals were 45 dollars. Cooked right, and seasoned this review would be different. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Went here for a late breakfast with the husband. This place is chrome-shiny and appears larger on the inside than on the outside. Our server was abrupt, almost military-like, but she was on it with the service. My man got the coconut French toast. He liked the topping, but wished that it was made with thinner bread than the challah. He also longed for real maple syrup (I have spoiled him). I ordered the veggie omelet, hash browns and biscuit. The biscuit was light and fluffy, and the omelet and hash browns were decent. Hard to mess up eggs, but also difficult to make an omelet stand out. I like the vintage styled memorabilia on the wall. The booth where we sat featured ""I Love Lucy"" and the Rat Pack. Motown played on the juke box, which added to the retro charm. At the end of our meal, our no nonsense server gave us a sweet, little smile. That was nice. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I'd give them high marks for execution. Everything was cooked properly, served promptly and efficiently. Not a lot of creativity or soul beyond the menu preparation. Typical for the Vegas high end joints that cater to people on business. Like everything on The Strip prices are astronomical - I will never forgive a restaurant that charges $125 for a bottle of wine I can get for $25. The hostesses seated everyone close together so it became very noisy even though the restaurant was half-empty. No place charging these prices should make such mistakes. Great place if you're on an expense account. If it's your own money I would pick a different city. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Mmmmmm. So good. They start you off with salt and vinegar popcorn. What. Right? Yum! I had the Rising Sun burger, I believe it was Kobe beef patty with deep fries avocado, teriyaki sauce, furikake maybe...don't quite remember. But it was yummy! They had a couple of others ones I wanted to try also but my belly couldn't handle all that food. I also had a dreamy cookies and cream milkshake (alcoholic) - portions for the shakes are pretty big. The art in this place is so cute too haha. Animated cows dressed as pigs doing random things. Would probably come back to try the beers and the pork belly buns. Yas. ",0,0,0,0,1

 The guys here at DCG have some serious passion for the Coney Dog and the action they have going on is pretty cool as well. Inside is full of fun items to make you feel like you're back in the Detroit area and then some. Take your time and check out the walls. I've never been to Michigan but do love THE DOG. Been here a couple times and usually order a couple of their famous Coney Combos. Even broke down and had to test out some of the Chili Cheese Fries. Nice! Really like the way the Dog pops in your mouth as you bite into them. The Hand Cut Fries are made fresh to order and you can definitely tell the difference. They also have Burgers, Pitas, Salads and boneless Chicken Wings as well. The food is pretty good and most people seem to rate this place rather high. I'm inclined to go with an A-OK since the Chili or Coney sauce just did not have much of a thrill factor or flavor profile for me and the hotdogs are little on the pricey side. Give them a try and see what you think. This is one of those regional flavors that you are going to enjoy more if you are from that area. I tend to lean toward the Windy City when hankering for a special treat. BEEP BEEP! 3.5 STARS ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've been to Cafe Zupas a couple of times. Living in Mesa (also known as South Utah), Zupas gets all kinds of hype - there was a ton of excitement about this place opening. So I went. So, does this place live up to hype? Absolutely not. The only thing I can say about why it is so popular around here, is, ""it must be a Utah thing."" It's part of their cultural identity... But their cultural identity is play-it-safe, don't-do-anything-too-different, and bland. The food here is fine. The soup is fine. The sandwiches are a little mediocre. The drink bar is fine. But the soup is not to die for. The drink bar is not to die for. The whole place is an exercise in being slightly better than average. Zupas is to Subway what In-N-Out Burger is to McDonald's. I don't even remember which sandwiches and soups I've tried. I know I've had a mushroom-based soup that was decent... They just weren't that memorable. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The service was definitely lacking here. I went to happy hour here this afternoon and the waitress, an older lady with dark curly hair was not very personable and rarely checked in on us. Then she made a stink about us wanting to split the check. The restaurant was dead btw so it's not like she has a bunch of other tables to tend to or anything. As we were dining we noticed that every server in the parking lot looked miserable coming in as well and while leaving we heard another guest complain about the bar service. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Wow, this restaurant is one of the worst in Las Vegas. We came here on Mother's day and it was $30/person. Other than its location and interior settings, the restaurant is nearly worthless. The food is either tasteless or overcooked and the service is extremely poor. Our server forgot to give us our utensils/table settings even after we asked him twice. We had our plates of food on the table for more than 10 minutes, but still no utensils are given, so we have to ask another server to give us some forks/spoons. This is just ridiculous.. Also, the server only picked up our used plates once at the beginning of the meal, by the time we leave, we have 5 completely-full used plates on the table, which has been sitting there for more than 20 minutes.. I can't believe Le Village would hire guys like him.. I understand Las Vegas Paris is not Wynn, but still, it's hard to believe they let Le Village operate like this.. ",1,0,0,0,0

 2 stars for customer service, but the food was good so bumping them up to 3 stars... I had been waiting for this location to open for a while, as I work fairly close to it and we are always on the lookout for new places to get lunch. I needed to run an errand on my lunch break recently, so I called in an order to go for myself and a coworker. My first impression upon arriving was that the management didn't care enough about the customers waiting to order or pay. I called in my order to try to save myself some time... When it was my turn to pay, the cashier was being spoken to by both district manager and the store manager (I could tell their position by their name badges) which is fine, the place had just recently opened and it's likely there was still training occurring. What was not fine in my opinion was that after another employee asked me if I had been helped, he tried to get the cashier to ring me up. BOTH of the managers looked over to the register, saw me waiting as well as multiple others behind me, and decided to continue their conversation with the cashier. When they finished talking, all three walked over to the register and made eye contact with me, but only the cashier apologized for the wait. Thankfully my food was ready by the time I was rang up so I didn't have to wait any longer. The food itself was good, I had the Club Royale which had a lot of meat which is nice, some places skimp. would have preferred a fruit cup rather then cups for a side but the additional cost for the healthier option was a little ridiculous. I don't see myself going back for another try for a while, hopefully another month or two the staff of Jason's Deli will get their system figured out and hopefully management will realize the importance of respecting their customer's time.

 We stopped here while we were exploring Montreal. At the moment I am really into juicing so I did not pay much attention to the rest of the menu.

 Our experience at Otto's was mixed. They brought the breadsticks that are imported from Italy. We ask for bread, which came with no butter or oil. They brought oil after we ask. I has the braised pork shoulder and would give it a five. The apple reduction was out of this world. My wife had spaghetti with pepper and butter. It was just average. I ordered Lemoncello and it was terrible. I sent back and the waiter said the bar tender did not shake it up. The second glass was better, but still not good. I would not recommend. We share the three flavored of Gelato and we only found two favors and they were just OK, again I wouldn't reorder. Our service was good.

 Good pizza places that deliver are hard to come by, or maybe I've become a Pizza snob, I'll have to check my wallet for a membership card. Well this was a recommendation from a friend and we were in the mood for pizza, so we ordered up a House Special. We were told that it would be 45 minutes before we'd have it, pretty standard and generally this is an under-promise over deliver type thing. This is where we started off on the wrong foot. I called an hour later to get a status of the pizza, it was out for delivery. An hour and 10 minutes after placing the order we had it in our hands. And I have to say, even if they did deliver on time, I don't think I would be ordering from them anytime soon, it just wasn't all that great, everything was pretty bland. Order here if you need a pizza and any pizza will do and you have the time to wait. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've found that the mark of a good Italian restaurant is how well they make you a spaghetti bolognese. It seems to be the simplest of Italian dishes that encompasses everything good about Italian food. A well done pasta and a tasty meat sauce that is spiced just right - something basic that mama teaches you.I know - it's a stupid rule but one that has worked for me nonetheless. My bolognese at this joint came in lumpy and absent of taste. The waitstaff take their time to get to you (and it wasn't busy at all) unless they are bringing you the cheque. My wife ordered the veal and it was overdone. We had a third person in our party that ordered a eggplant parm (which is pretty much the only vegetarian thing they had) - and that was done relatively well. I can see the charm in wanting to eat here - but it's just not worth the price in my humble estimation. I've eaten good Italian food in Italy, NYC, Philadelphia and L.A. I am yet to find a place that matches that definition in Las Vegas. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The interior of this restaurant doesn't look at all like I expected. No warm music, no tablecloths, no Italian paintings. In fact, it's pretty cold, a bit modern, and not all warm in the ambiance department. The restaurant itself was empty besides the table by us, and the bar had several men sitting at it. Don't rush out and get your glam on,Girls, they're around my dearly-departed Dad's age . The food? Very average. The wine selection? Very small, and red's are not chilled to the temperature's that they should be. My husband ordered the Shrimp Verde appetizer and the mussel's as his meal. I ordered the stuffed shells. My stuffed shells were good, in and of themselves, but the vodka sauce was so salty that I am not swelling up and so thirsty that I am guzzling water. My husbands shrimp verde was pretty good. Nothing offensive about them. The mussel's were a little fishy, and although I generally love mussels, one was enough. This place is quite a bit overpriced for what you get, in my opinion. If you're an Italian, or an italian-food-lover, you may want to try somewhere else.. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I remember when this place first opened. I was very excited since it seemed so ""humbling"". I came here for lunch and thought this place actually looks ""okay"" at best. Chicken Sandwich was excellent. The bread was toasty and crunchy, while the Chicken and toppings were warm and buttery! However, the soup can improve. They only gave to you 2 options so I guess I had a 50/50 chance of getting the good one! The place was loud and popping! Not sure what to make of it since they had wine racks and wine, but then teeny hot pink tank tops hanging from the wines. Is this supposed to make me want to drink more wine or should I buy a shirt for my GF? Though I don't think anyone would appreciate a shirt that says PIE. Service was good, I guess. Our waiter was very nice and helpful, but he seemed flustered with a smile. He didn't do anything wrong by any means except he was going about 100 more miles than I was. - Enjoy ",0,0,1,0,0

 I love the look and feel of this small warm friendly sexy restaurant on St Laurent and Rachel. The staff was funny and welcoming and helpful and made me want to come back often for oysters and cocktails at the bar. The lighting and design is romantic without being fancy, eclectic and history rich without trying too hard. Lots to look at and talk about. The food we tried - especially the raw salmon salad, bean salad and oysters - was delicate and smart and very yummy. I came in starving and did feel like the menu lacked options for food that suited the room: warm, filling, cool, unpretentious. Lots of small plates at fairly high prices when I was there but I think they change it up often, and anyway the clean bright tastes and the completely perfect cocktail made for me based on a description of how I was feeling by a handsome happy gent who didn't miss a beat all night will bring me back again for sure.

 I can't say I was as blown away by the food as many of the reviewers were, but the food was well above average. We got there a little bit before they were going to close, so my experience may have been lessened by the fact that i had to rush and shove the food in my face as quickly as possible. The girl working there was super nice and genuinely interested in feedback and our experience at the restaurant. I had the pad woon sen and boyfriend had pad kee mao. His dish was a lot better. Mine was good but fell a bit short in the flavor department -- it was plain and the chicken was dry and tasteless. The pad kee mao was good with just the right amount of heat. I did not care to try the curries because after making my own, I realized how idiot proof making a delicious curry really is. In flavor department Naga wins out by a high margin, but service wise Penns definitely wins. I will go back and sample more of their dishes. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I would give this place more stars if the prices were lower or the food was better. Unfortunately, expensive prices for mediocre food is not for me. We tried 5 dishes here, and neither of us were excited about any of them. The calamari was bland and rubbery, the patatas (although cooked very well) were doused in too much sauce, and the cheese croquettes were just okay. The filet was the best thing we ordered, and it was pretty good. The creme brulee dessert was not very good.

 WOW! Crap-O! We have gone to other TGI Fridays in the past and had a much better experience. Stopped in here on our way back from a weekend trip. Tried to go to a neighboring restaurant, but did not want to wait 45 minutes. Low and behold we were able to get right in at TGIF! I guess that should have been our first red flag!! We were seated right away and our server took drink orders and apps order. We ordered the Green Bean Fries - these were pretty good, but not as good as the ones at PF Changs. I ordered the Dragon Fire Salmon, which comes with rice pilaf and broccoli. My wife ordered the TGIF Shrimp, which comes with fries and all you can eat shrimp. When our meals arrived, my plate looked like a garbage pile! You know, like when you watch a cooking show and they keep throwing the scraps onto a pile somewhere on the side...Well, that was my plate! A messy pile up of rice, broccoli, and salmon! What a mess. I had to deconstruct the pile of garbage before I could begin eating. When the waitress asked how it was, and I told her the truth, she seemed to not really care at all. Then the manager was making the butt-kissing rounds and asked how things were. I repeated my minor complaint to her, and she just sort of shrugged and said ""thanks"" while she walked away. Messy presentation aside, the salmon was pretty good. The rest was ok. My wife's meal was nothing special and she practically had to beg for the refill of shrimp. Worst part, though, was the waitress. Her name was Stephanie. VERY inattentive to customers. Took eons for her to notice we needed drink refills. Took forever to get the bill, as well. Next booth over was luckier - they had a server named Jessica and she was super attentive and made me feel jealous that I was not seated in her section! Overall we will NEVER eat here again!

 I have been to this location many times to get propane in my truck, and every single time, I have left there feeling very frustrated. To get propane, you pull up to the propane tank area and ring a doorbell to let the employees know that you need assistance. There is no way to communicate with the employees without going into the building, and you can not see to the inside from the propane tank area. There is no way of knowing if the bell worked after pressing the button, and no way of knowing if anyone is at the register area to hear it. I have never waited less than five minutes for someone to respond at this location, and today it took me more than 25 minutes to get out of there. I went inside the building and could not find ANYONE manning the 'store' and no way to signal or summon anyone, but many employees were standing around in back. I called out to the nearest one, who was cleaning a truck, and told him I needed help. He said he would send someone out, so I went back to my truck to wait. Another five minutes passed, and the same employee drove the truck I had just seen him cleaning to the front. I made him aware that I was STILL waiting, and he said he would send someone. Another five minutes and I felt like I was being held hostage. not being able to leave because my tank was empty and I didn't know if I could make it to another station that sold propane. Yet another employee drove a truck to the front, and I let HIM know I had been waiting a very long time, and he said he would send someone out. Oy. After waiting in 104F heat, someone FINALLY came out and filled my tank, and then the ""pay at the pump"" gadget failed to work, and I was asked to go inside again to pay. Once inside there was some other computer problem and I had to wait another few minutes for that to get sorted out. Twenty-five minutes to get gas in my truck is ridiculous. I have never rented a truck from this location, so I can't speak for their customer service in that area, but I will NOT be using this location again except in cases of extreme emergency. VERY disappointed with my experiences here. Luckily I work near the Gilbert location, and their customer service is outstanding. I will have to arrange my schedule to fill up there from now on.

 Sauce, I wanted to like you. You never gave me a chance. I had heard of your happy hour specials. After work, my energy had been too drained to make the trip to the north parking lot of the Galleria Mall. Yesterday I had the chance to give you a try. I had just voted in the Galleria Mall and when I was in the bottom level of Kohl's sneaker hunting, I looked out the door to lay eyes on you a few hundred feet away. It was time to take a hiatus from shopping to give you a try. The walk from Kohl's is a beeline to your door. Some malls like the one in St. George, Utah would consider you a mall tenant. As I neared closer to the door that faces the mall (not Galleria Drive), I saw the Happy Hour specials. That could be for another time. It was 2 pm on a Friday afternoon. As I made it nearer to the door, I noticed that the parking lot was barron. This was an oman to the infinitesimal amount of customers inside. Now inside, I am standing inside a colossal lifeless building that reminded me of a monastery. I'd gaze at an unoccupied host station to my right, empty bar in the middle, and monastery spaces to my left and right. I'd gaze and gaze and gaze for ten minutes. I was feeling like an unwanted bull. My left foot was bothering me and I did not want to resume sneaker shopping just yet. There seemed to be a want of a seating policy. To me, your policy is sauce. Was I supposed to walk deeper into the monastery rooms? Was an employee (there are employees here?) going to venture toward the entrance where there might just be a slight possibility that an individual could of walked inside with an intention of like eating here? Why wasn't there a buzzer that informs an employee that somebody is here? Finally, a waitress acknowledged me. She apologized for the long delay on account of a blind spot where she did not see me. That is a bunch of sauce because she should of occasionally walked past this blind spot to the waiting area where customers are waiting to be seated. I followed the waitress (no hostess here at 2 pm on this Friday). we walked deep into the recesses of the monastery to the left. For whatever reason I am one of the couple of people in this restaurant, and she seats me out of the way. Why not nearer the kitchen where I would be nearby instead of some Bull seated way out in the boondocks of the monastery. The waitress gave me the menu. This is the last I'd see of her. Spending some time in your lifeless place, I had trouble believing that you are this energetic bar slash Italian restaurant in the later hours of the day. I just couldn't fathom it. As I looked at the menu, it was dawning on me that I was better off transforming from an unwanted Bull to royalty at a different place. This is Las Vegas after all and not Siberia. The menu just wasn't the kind of sauce that is my flavor. I saw relatively few lunch specials. But my love for eggplant parmesan with provolone cheese topped with pasta and a glass of Coke turned a blind eye to the fact that there was zero mention of coming with a soup or salad. If only you gave me a chance I would of exchanged $20 of my hard earned money for it. I remained an ignored bull. I had had enough. I was now in the mood to be appreciated in either Miller's Ale House or Cafe Zupas. It was time to leave the lifeless spaces of the monastery. Sauce, I wanted to like you. But you barely acknowledged me and in reality should open at 4 pm, if you treat customers like this as 2 pm. I don't like going to a restaurant to feel like an unwanted bull. To me that is just bull sauce. ",0,1,0,0,0

I love this take on Hawaiin and Breakfast Food, definitely something different and the pancake variety is crazy good. I personally do not care for pancakes but here, they are irresistable, super moist and fluffy and pretty much any topping you could wish for. One of my favorite dishes tho is the spam omellete, omg... I really don't understand what spam is, nor do I want to, but fried... it is one of the most amazing meats(?) ever!! I love the little sesame & seawood stuff they sprinkle on the rice, what a unique breakfast. The prices aren't too bad either, for the food, I think its worth it, something off the strip and outside of the box. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We were in route from Phoenix to Tuscon and needed dinner. I looked up a few places online and Eva's seemed like a reasonable option. This restaurant has EVERYTHING it needs to be successful: * A cool atmosphere-- check! * a great menu--check! * Good drink specials--check! check! Despite all of this, this was hands down the WORST Mexican dinner I have ever had in my entire life. (I eat a ton of Mexican food). First of all, the service is terrible. Our waitress did not know what beer was on tap, did not know the drink specials or happy hour dinner apps and didn't give us appropriate drink refills. The food takes the cake for being just plain awful. I ordered tortilla soup and one of the happy hour nachos, my husband ordered a combo meal and my cousin ordered a steak rice bowl. After one bite of my soup, I was completely done (tasted like it was burnt), my husband and cousin could stomach a little more than me but still felt like the food was sub par at best. I mentioned to the server that I was disappointed with my soup and all she could offer was to take it back to the kitchen (no replacement option or comp ticket). Bottom line: Would I ever eat here again? Nope. Never. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My Husband & I met some friends for lunch here while we were in town. The wait was about 20 mins, but we were seated on the patio, where there was live music and a beautiful view of Scottsdale & Camelback! I ordered the Market Sunflower salad; blackened chicken, goat chz, bacon, dried strawberry, blueberry, sunflower seeds & my husband the Smoked Turkey Ciabatta; gouda, bacon,sweet tomato, roasted red pepper aioli. I LOVED my salad, but the hubs was a little less than totally satisfied with his sandwich, however the sweet potato chips were super yummy! I would definitely come back! ",0,0,0,1,0

 For ramen and broth fanatics, this is literally as good as it gets. Always very busy, and there's a reason for it. PLEASE Cherryblossom, if you're listening, launch a location in OldTown. Cha Shu Ramen #1 must, however definitely go with the egg noodles in this one. Smoky, creamy broth will have you feening. Udon Suki Pot #2 must, they crack a raw egg on top to finish it off and the broth is so hot it cooks it. Deliciously flavorful beef broth. Spicy Gyoza Soup Appetizer #3 must. Must. Must. Must. Warning, it is actually extremely spicy, it will make your nose run. But I literally had a couple dreams about it, it was that good. I actually didn't like the champon noodles very much, but might be a personal preference. The tan-tan men noodles were very good as well. Sushi is decent. Haven't tried the asian-italian fusion dishes but my ex always ordered one and they looked absolutely fantastic. ",0,0,0,0,1

 So we've been back about three more times because I've developed a wings addiction that is bordering on troublesome. Seriously, I might need an intervention. The wings continue to be *delicious*... although we've started to notice we aren't getting 12 in a basket. Last time it was 10. The size hasn't increased... hmmm... The increased star is for the fries. It is no secret that the fries at Zipps are not the best. (See this talk thread: http://www.yelp.com/topic/gilbert-now-that-the-lockout-is-over-lets-talk-sports-bars) The flavor is good, but they are always soggy and limp.

 The actual light show overhead is not very entertaining. I did miss the beginning. I figured it wouldn't matter, but I was slightly confused. It kept showing scenic environments, and after a few minutes, some man-made device would come and disturb the peace and cause birds and animals to fly/run away. I thought it was a political piece about the environment or something, but it ended with a rocket blasting off into space so I don't know what they were going for. Other than that, it's a lot of fun walking around. Everything is enclosed, and there are lots of great lights and signs from the old casinos. There's usually a free show outside and people handing out free gifts. The casinos are smaller (which means you get your free drinks a lot sooner) and they have much better odds. I was actually able to win some money here. ",0,0,0,1,0

 After being in Vegas for just over 2 years, I can finally say I've found the best hairstylist. Shellynn genuinely listens to what you're looking for and delivers way above expectation.

 After three trips to Tornado I've decided on two stars. Pros: Old school atmosphere, sides included, great lighting, comfortable bar. Cons: Waitstaff knows nothing about wine (literally), steaks are below average quality for the price, service in general feels more like a pub than somewhere that serves $45 pieces of beef. Honestly I'll probably pay a few more bucks for a real steak at a place like...well...I guess that's the issue in Madison...Flemings is stupid overpriced and Delmonicos is hit-or-miss. Overall Tornado is uniquely Madison and has its pluses. But when I'm spending that much money I expect a little better service and quality. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I can't really complain about a Vegas buffet that only costs $19.95 for DINNER! Buffet dinner is good for under $20 is good from Sat-Thurs. Of course it is no Wynn buffet, but it does the job. There are two Ready to Made stations where chefs will cook up your customized pasta or mongolian noodles dish. I ordered a ready to made pasta. The sauce was a little too much and overpowered the pasta. Desserts aren't anything to ooo and ahhh about either; they are just your typical desserts. The only thing that really stood out to me was the prime rib. It was juicy and delicious. Other than that, nothing really stood out to me, but you get what you pay for. Oh!

 I was so excited to eat at this place. I ate at babo and loved it. i went with two friends. the wine list was great and the server let me try two to decide what i wanted. i liked that. the bread, butter and lardo was great. i asked the waiter for his favorite pasta and he recommended the beef cheek ravioli. i love it when a waiter has an opinion. my friends ordered a strip well done and filet medium. my rav came out. it had no impact on the plate. no garnish and a small portion. it was good, not great. my friends steaks were way underdone. the fliet which was supposed to be medium was Medium rare to rare. the sirloin was was medium/medium rare. they both sent them back. the filet was still a bit underdone. the strip was still medium. my friend sent it back one more time. we finished our meals before he got his steak back. they comped a dessert which was great - trio of gelatos and comped one glass of wine. the service was great, but the food was disappointing.

 Beauty may not last forever, but with a little maintenance, I am going to milk it for all it's worth! I have been a customer of Tangles Salon for the last 7 years.

Brazilian Blowout.... smooth, silky straight hair thanks to owner, Becky Color, Cut and Highlights Facial Lash Tint Make up Manicure Massage Pedicure Shampoo Style Up do Wax Now, I am sure there are a few more... but a girl has to keep some secrets... I really enjoy the atmosphere, professionalism and good vibe at Tangles. No prima donnas or drama here, everyone seems to be genuinely friendly and a pretty close knit group, not a lot of turn over. It is a very comfortable place for both men and women to come get shampooed, styled, and polished. My son and daughter, both teenagers now, have been Tangles customers for most of their lives. Appointments seem to be usually necessary, but I have seen a number of walk-ins accommodated also. ",0,0,1,0,0

 So disappointed to have to write this! Our large group of 12 came at around 4:00pm and were able to get 2 tables together pretty quickly, which was great. Then our waitress was quick to get us started on drinks, again, that was great. Then, a waiter came to our table and said he was taking over for our waitress and all the guys were so disappointed. When I asked what the big deal was, one guy said men don't take care of people like women. I thought okay, maybe he has a point. Well, he definitely did have a point. The waiter was HORRIBLE. Not attentive, we sat with empty glasses for at least 10 minutes before he noticed, and several times we had to flag him down for more drinks and napkins and our check. It was a bummer because the space is great, the beer is great, and the food is great.....but the service ruined our whole experience. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Took my car in to get a quote on the brakes, my car is a 2011 with only 41,300 miles on it. They wanted to replace all the pads and all the rotors, saying that the rotors were rusted and quoted me $660 for all four. Took the car to the dealership who said only the rear brake pads needed to be replaced, I have at least a year left on the front pads.

 The Sunday after New Year's Day a friend and I made an impromptu visit to Hamiltons for lunch after we found that both the nearby Hector's and Peter's Yard had no space for us. We had to clear the messy table ourselves and wait for a while to be served but, considering how busy the place was, this was understandable. The menu was fairly varied and offered a few choices for vegetarians like me (although two of the starters were marked with a 'V' when one contained bacon and the other salmon!). We both opted for the vegetarian breakfast which arrived very quickly and couldn't be faulted. Hamiltons has a fairly cosy atmosphere. The bar area to the left of the main door contains comfortable sofas overlooking the windows onto Hamilton Place. The raised eating area to the right is brightened by a feature wall depicting a Lichtenstein illustration, although this may be a little 'in your face' for some. I have to say I prefer the softer colours favoured by Hector's. A recommended visit should you be down in Stockbridge for a weekend walk (it's very close to the entrance to the stretch of the Water of Leith walk that takes you down to Dean Village, and the galleries beyond). And a popular place for a weekday drink after work. ",0,0,1,0,0

 All restaurants seem to have their ups-and-downs. If not the economy, it's vendor issues, chef turn-over, or management loss of focus. But ya gotta have faith in the ""blue chip"" local stars. Case-in-point: Our Sunday brunch/happy hour last week was simple, low-key, but perfect. Server John expertly recommended the sparkling Sangria (at only $15, half price!). The refreshing pitcher of it was perfect with the creamy Shrimp Adriatico, and TWO orders of Carlsbad Mussels. Make sure you get plenty of bread too, to wipe up every last bit of the juices here.

 I'm not sure what my problem is when trying to pronounce the name of this place because I always call it HopdADDYS, but i will learn because as far as I'm concerned its the best burger in the valley. Been here a few times and each experience was the same. Consistently delicious burgers and friendly staff. While I'm not overly fond of the stand in line to get a table formula, It works out in a first come first serve basis which allows the kitchen to dish out the burgers in a proper order. Happy hour here is phenomenal with 2 dollars off your burger at two different times. Spending 6 dollars for an exquisite burger during happy hour will bring me back time and time again. Don't quote me on the times but it was 3-6pm and then a late night happy hour as well. ",0,0,0,1,0

 MGM Grand. The hotel with all the big boxing matches and the lion ""habitat"". It was the first time I stayed here and we found it for a pretty reasonable price. A big heads up when parking in their structure is to remember exactly where you parked. It could get kind of confusing and you may get lost. Checking in was really quick and rooms are pretty spacious. One of the biggest downers was that when we made room reservations online the website said we would have free buffet tickets. When my husband went to check in the girl at the front desk said she had no indication of that special on the system. She stated that if there was something on the confirmation email or if we have proof she could give it to us. I was totally bummed even though my husband screenshot it on his ipad from the website we didn't decide to pursue it. We kind of forgot about it. Still a big let down though. The room was pretty spacious but the television was a little dated. One of the big things I look for in a hotel room is a flat screen and this television was a little old school. The room was fairly clean minus the pillow with ""stains"" on it. Yes, I know. I have watched all those little news specials about how disgustingly dirty 5 star hotel rooms are and how many stains are on the walls and comforters using a blacklight. The only thing is I didn't have a blacklight and the stains were just there. Mind you it was only the decoration pillow but it was pressed up against the pillows we were supposed to sleep on. I threw it on the side of the room and opted to not have the room service clean so they don't put it back on the bed. Aside from that the bed was amazing and I had the best sleep there on my vacation. The hotel is location is pretty good too especially if you are driving since its more toward the beginning of the strip. There's lots of restaurants and lounges in the hotel that you can choose from but the hotel is currently under some renovation. You can also walk next door to New York New York or to the other nearby hotels. Great thing is that it is located at the beginning of the monorail if you want to blow $15 bucks for an all day pass to use the monorail on the strip. Overall good experience for the price.

My companions had some good stuff too -- pork adobo was good and portioned as if the whole pig was used; chicken katsu was light and tasty.

 Had the build your own burger with the grass-fed beef and some gourmet toppings, and it was pretty good. Better than burgers at other restaurants, granted I don't usually order burgers when I go out to eat. They do actually have A LOT of gourmet toppings to choose from, which was nice. Also, the sweet potato fries were really good. The hubs had the sliders and said they were very good. They had a ton of craft beers to choose from, and I thought the prices for reasonable for a place on the strip. The place was packed, so we sat at the bar when two seats opened up, after waiting about 25 minutes for a table. I think I might have gotten food poisoning though, since I got violently ill after eating here. The hubs was fine. I can't remember, but I probably ordered my burger medium. Shoulda gone for well-done, I guess. The food was good enough for three stars when it went down, however, coming back up.... eh. I leave it at that. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Not a fan of the over night cook at the stop and shop. He was very rude and antagonizing. He also burns the chicken which makes it really hard instead of the normal day cook that makes it really good!! This place is so convenient and close and also always open but I dont think i will be returning to this location over night. I may give them another shot in the day time if I am really hungry or just craving wingsand I dont feel like driving. But they need to seriously reconsider their employees ",1,0,0,0,0

 The first time I visited this store it was just about the best furniture shop I had ever been in. I reviseted the store hoping to find a bed that the girl and I had fallen in love with to find they had completely revamped the store. They are now more of a boutique store with more clothing and accessories than the incredible furniture that I had fallen in love with. The store is still pretty rad and certainly visitable but I was disapointed at how little furniture they now had including a lack of the bed I wanted. They have Sailor Jerry stuff and Tokidoki which is always cool...crosses and nick nacks. The store has an overall cool feel to it. Not a bad shop to check out if in the area, but I won't go out of my way for the furniture again. If you are a lady who is of the style persuasion that likes the Tokidoki and Sailor Jerry type stuff and you live on this side of town this place is a real gem. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I went to this Denny's only because it was on the way to where I was headed for the day. It's a self standing not like the other two in the area which are in a mini-mall. (Craig road and Anne road.) It seemed busy but we were seated right away, which was nice. However it pretty much went down hill from there. I was brought the wrong drink and when I asked for it to be replaced I was given an iced tea with some kind of garbage in it. Twice the waitress came by to ask how we were, but never stayed long enough at the table to let me answer. That is beyond annoying, I'd rather just be ignored. I made my husband ask the manager to take off my beverage since I never got to drink it. He was polite enough to take off both drinks for us and apologized. All the food was over cooked exept for the hashbrowns which were still cold, but I wasn't going to push my luck here. Leave this place for all the truckers and go somewhere else for your Denny's fix.

 I took my 2006 Chevy Cobalt in for an oil change this morning (I scheduled an appointment over the phone yesterday). The guy at the desk was friendly and after about 10 minutes, one of the mechanics started working on my car. My car has around 122,000 miles so I was expecting them to tell me I needed SOMETHING fixed - turns out, one of my front brake pads and rotors needs replaced. I asked for a written estimate and they gave me one, no problem. When I asked if my car would be safe to drive for a week or two, the guy didn't give me a definite answer - he just said I'd hear squealing. I wasn't expecting him to tell me EXACTLY how many miles my brake pad will last but some idea would have been nice. I went in for a regular oil change and that's exactly what I got. For $26.95 (that's WITH a coupon), I hoped they would check the fluids or at least my tire pressure but no. Overall, it's a nice enough shop considering it's in San Tan Valley but I'm used to getting a bit more with an almost $30 oil change, that's all. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was in Madison for the holiday weekend and popped into Bluephies for a bite; it'd been since college since I'd visited last. The space is much larger; definitely welcome as I remember it being a bit cramped. As another reviewer noted, there are plenty of vegetarian options; I opted for a scrambler with portobello mushrooms, tomatoes, and feta cheese. It was tasty though I think that I would've done something different with the side potatoes...there was something missing that I just couldn't quite put my finger on. One other plus is that there is some nice boutique shopping just up the street from Bluephies; if you have some time, you could make a few hours of it. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The fifth star is missing due to the fact they have downsized this ""mall"" substantially. I can remember needing hours to get through this home of all things vintage, tacky, and just plain interesting; but alas, they have cut the space in half I'm guessing due to the pesky economy. : / There's just something about that musty smell of old..not people old, that's an entirely different odor and not nearly as pleasant. I'm not talking about moth balls either, I am speaking of the scent the memories these quirky gadgets, sturdy pieces of furniture, and miscellaneous decor possess. The history behind each piece collected here at the Antique Mall (and any antique shop to be quite honest) intrigues me. From vintage glassware, to collectible memorabilia, I quiet fancy the old box and Polaroid camera's myself (shocker, I'm sure). Visiting this home of all things antique brings back memories, and that thing that happens as we get older..I think they call it nostalgia? Memories-shmemories, though, I'll admit to you that I find it a little disturbing that things from my childhood (I'm a product of the 80's) are surfacing in an ANTIQUE store now, haha. If you want a trip down memory lane, a couple laughs or if you're looking for that completely unique gift for a quirky certain someone, definitely make Antique Mall of America a stop on your list!

 After my visit to Eide's Entertainment, I must say I am not a fan and was in no way impressed. A fact that was even more disappointing, considering it was the only store out of about five or so that I wanted to visit during my weekend in Pittsburgh that I actually got to shop at. Seeing how much other people love it, I feel that my unhappiness with Eide's probably needs some further explanation. First of all, this place is much more of a comic book store than it is a record store, something I was completely aware of going into it. However, I was still disappointed with the selection of records that the store offered. It didn't seem very diverse to me and much of it seemed extremely over priced. I ended up only buying one record from Eide's because of this. In addition, and the biggest reason I am giving Eide's two stars, is the staff here is very, very rude. No, I don't mean your typical ""I work at a record store so I am better than you"" rude you get at some stores. The employees working on the record level of the store were just plain nasty. I saw a 40+ year old man yell at my little sister for putting a record back out of alphabetical order. Keep in mind, my little sister is about 5 feet tall and maybe weigh 100 lbs. I guess that this guy gets his jollies off of bullying little girls, who knows, but it was unacceptable. To top it off, he did everything but accuse my sister of stealing the record, because he couldn't find it. Of course he couldn't find it because my sister did put it back in alphabetical order where it went. Ass. Long story short, I will never ever return to Eide's Entertainment and I would discourage anyone else who cares about being treated with some sense of decency to do the same. These guys really need to get over themselves. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Six of us came here for dinner on a guys trip. Problems started right away as they could not find our reservation. It took 10 minutes before they finally agreed to seat us, and they put us outside in the heat which is not what we asked for. We ordered our entrees and drinks. I finished my pepsi and asked for another, but they wanted to charge me for another drink. Seriously? We spent over $500 here for dinner and you want to nickel and dime me for a pepsi? I hate it when places do that. The food finally came and it was just so-so. I had the penne seafood alfredo and it was nothing special at all.

 If I had my own annual Vegas awards ""Best restaurant to eat solo"" would definitely be a category and this place would certainly be a nominee. This is the best place to eat solo in Town Square for sure. I like the fact that all the chairs face the window so you don't have to make eye contact with anyone else in the place and there's ample reading material to easily ignore everyone there.

 Chatime has one of the best bubble teas in North America. I first had their bubble teas in Toronto and immediately loved it. The good: - Great tasting and authentic bubble teas. - Great variety of bubble teas. - Many ways of customizing your tea, such as choosing warm vs. cold, amount of ice, amount of sugar, etc. - Reward card gives you a free tea after 9 purchases. The not-so-good: - The store itself has few seats and is not well decorated or suited for sitting down and enjoying your tea. - Staff service is average at best. - Teas are on the pricier side (5-7$). Bottom line: I highly recommend this place for bubble tea enthusiasts, although the products are slightly on the pricier side (5$+). Suggest you order to go as there isn't much space to sit and chat.

 During the day George Street provides a whole range of classy shops and restaurants. There is a Harvey Nichols in St Andrews square, a high end jewellers and a wide selection of health and beauty salons. In the evening there a plenty of excellent restaurants to visit, my personal favourite being Henderson's Bistro which serves great food at prices which are suprisingly low for the area. By night George Street also has plenty to offer. None of the bars or clubs are cheap and a lot of them market themselves to the University's richer students. Tigerlily, for example, is amazing inside with loads of comfortable seating and a great atmosphere, but it's seriously expensive. The four main clubs in the area are Why Not?, Opal, Lulu and Shanghai. All of which offer a great night and are popular with virtually all students as a result. In terms of prices they actually aren't too bad all of them have plenty of drinks deals going on inside. George Street has a reputation for being the expensive, posh place to go, but if you compare your wallet in the morning to a night after Cabaret Voltaire, for instance, it wins hands down. A night on George Street just isn't some people's thing, but most will find it a great fun night with plenty to see and do. ",0,0,0,1,0

 As happy as I am that I'm married, I have no happy story to tell thanks to Vegas weddings! My fiance and I wanted to quickly get married in a fun way to take care of some legal stuff before our actual real wedding in a year and a half, and we discovered that not all Vegas weddings are like the fun ones you see in the movies and Vegas commercials. First off, do not even try to joke about the sanctity of marriage or you might be thrown out. My fianc \ u00e9 and I are both pretty sarcastic fun loving people who just wanted to be fun and sarcastic together for the rest of our lives and we did not appreciate the lectures that we got from the pastor and the very sour and unfriendly staff about how we were in a serious wedding chapel. Secondly, come with your own pocket flasks because you will be waiting a long time and will be met with condescending glares should you mention alcohol. Lastly, stand firm my friends, no posed picture after the ceremony is worth $10 a photo with a minimum purchase of ten photos. This place is all about squeezing as much money out of you as possible. If you go for one of the cheaper packages expect horrible service! Go to one of the million other cheap looking chapels on Vegas blvd. You are sure to have more fun!!!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 My visit to Leith was the 'mission' of my long awaited trip to GB. Many generations of my family hail from Leith (my grand father was a Lindsay and his mother was a Leith), so spending a few days here was truly special. I was told to find this pub, as the property had some connection to my family (the details are a bit fuzzy... I should have paid more attention when my grandparents explained the association). We found it easily - almost by accident. It was just what I had pictured. The building itself is very old - goes back hundreds of years. The pub has two very, very small rooms, one for eating and drinking and another for drinking and darts. Intimate (shoulder-to-shoulder) seating. Brick walls. Low ceiling. Even a small fireplace at one end of the room we were in. We ordered fish, which was quite good. Seemed the safest thing on the menu [well, chalk board behind the bar] for a not so adventurous American. (Folks sitting next to us had haggis... I had to avert my eyes while they ate!) I don't know if this pub is normally frequented by tourists, but we were the only non-locals in the room the night we were there, which certainly added to the charm. The atmosphere was relaxed and encouraged lingering... which we did. We whiled away the entire evening in fact, my hubby hefting pints of ale while I became acquainted with Balvenie - a single malt scotch whisky which is now my favorite. And our tab for the entire evening was under 30 pounds! Amazing. Our visit to Kings Wark is one of my favorite memories of our two weeks in GB. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Edinburgh/Leith. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Yeah. I am pretty much appalled at this store. The only reasons to shop here are the selection and prices. The turn-offs include: Jerky employees - hard to put my finger on why this store attracts a weird breed of techno-jerk. Head scratching security annoyances such as needing to always get a supervisor to determine if your cash is authentic. The stupid long lane of cashiers and having to wait to be told which counter to go to... Clearly the prices rock - so if you know exactly what you need and are pretty sure you will never need to go back for support, then it is worth a stop. Personally, I prefer buying things from amazon.com to avoid paying the local taxes. Shopping at Frys is like brain-damage. I will pass if I can help it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My parents love this place, and I think it's only because their baseline is NJ diners, of which is this is definitely a cut above. When I come here with them while visiting, I know what I'm having before I walk in - an egg skillet breakfast. They aren't as good as Le Peep's, but this is much closer to my parents than Le Peep, so I end up here much more often. General menu looks very similar to diner offerings, with a bunch of Le Peep-ish touches that I consider a cut above diner food. They offer an additional coffee to go when one orders coffee, which is a good deal especially if you're the thrifty kind and have a second person who only wants a single cup of coffee, and have a punch card of buy 5 entrees, get 1 free which is good for repeat customer savings. I'm not really a breakfast person, but if I were looking for breakfast on my own, I would take this any day over Denny's, although it gets crowded on weekend mornings when the weather is nice and there's no way I'd consider it worth it to wait here to eat breakfast. 3 1/2 rounded down.

 I have never had an experience with a hotel as bad as the one I had this past weekend at the Stratosphere in Las Vegas. This week is my 36th birthday; so to celebrate, I decided, on the spur of the moment, to make a trip to Vegas to go to one of my favorite clubs last weekend. I mean, why not? This past year, I received a kidney transplant. No more dialysis, so now I could travel freely. I had the money. No reason not to, right? I originally wanted to just go and book whatever hotel room I could find while I was in Vegas itself, but at the urging of a close friend, I chose to go online and see if I could find a deal. I used a third party website, and found a room at the Statosphere for $67 per night. Since I was traveling late, and would not get there until after midnight, I booked it for Saturday, figuring I would stay overnight and come back to LA on Sunday. No problem, right? Apparently, in Las Vegas, days do not begin at midnight like they do everywhere else in the U.S. They begin at 3pm, which was naturally not indicated on my confirmation. So when I got to the Statosphere, and tried to check in at midnight itself, I was told that I would have to buy two days, because this was still considered Friday. No attempt to make good, just to charge me more money, a pattern I would later learn was typical for the Stratosphere. Across the street was a sleazy motel, so I figured I could just crash there for the night, and check into my room the next day. Since I did not have the much vaunted Statosphere for internet access, I searched for a wireless connection. As luck would have it, the city provides $5 wireless per day through Las Vegas.net. I bought two days, figured I would check in to the Statosphere the next day and all would be well. When I got to there, I learned why my room had been such a ""bargain"": it came with a glorious view of some storage area where apparently the hotel keeps scrap metal. Two windows worth, no less. But that wasn't as bad as learning that the Stratosphere BLOCKS wireless providers so you have to buy theirs... at $11 a day. Flabbergasted that a ritzy (cough!) hotel would be this cheap, I realized that I would have to use the phone to make my plans for the night. Not a big deal, I have a phone card, and their phone's display said local calls were free, except that, well, they're not. When I just got a rapid dialtone whenever I dialed nine, I tried calling the front desk for a solution. They put me on hold FOREVER. I tried other numbers - the concierge, the operator, SOMETHING - to find out what was wrong with my phone so I didn;t have to sit on hold, but to no avail. The Statosphere wanted me to hold on for five minutes, no matter what. So I did, only to learn that local calls are A DOLLAR each. What's on the phone, I guess, was put there by the manufacturer, because no one in their right mind would believe a luxury hotel would charge a buck each for LOCAL calls. But the Statosphere is not like other hotels. It's far worse. So I used the cell, got to where I needed to go, and got the Hell out of there, discovering my favorite thing about the Statosphere - check out is easy and fast. I'm sure they had to do that because they get so many. Bottom line, unless you're part of the 1%, stay at Circus Circus if you're going to Las Vegas on a budget. And stay as far from the Statosphere as you can. The tower, I now believe, was put in to distract you from how horrible this place is. Never again. ",1,0,0,0,0
