 Curious as to why this place hadn't closed down like the other restaurants in the horribly placed strip mall parking lot Tommy's sits in, my wife and I decided to stop in and try a burger... Oddly, they all come with chili, mustard, onion and pickle... The chili was more like alpo and the burger patty was thinner than a mcdonalds patty! Fries were good, but that's about it! And judging by the girl working the drive thru, you don't need a high school diploma to work here. Still not quite sure how this place remains open... ",0,1,0,0,0

 Sure, you could go to one of the steakhouses on the Strip that have been decorated to look like an old-school steakhouse... but for the same money, why not GO to an old-school steakhouse? The Golden Steer looks like a total dive on the outside, but inside it's the room that time forgot. Everything looks exactly like it would have back when the Rat Pack was said to be among the Steer's clientele. Service is equally old-school - your glasses will never be empty and every crumb quickly swept. The menu is equally traditional - steaks, creamed spinach, etc. It's cooked to order and tasty. We've gone here to celebrate signing big deals, but we've also just gone to get a great steak. It's worth the cab ride. ",0,0,0,0,1

 i have never had such bad service in my life and i have never been so mad about bad service before either. My friend and I decide to go to Chili's for our 1hr lunch break. We arrive at 11am. Within 5 mins of being there we order our food. She orders hers, i order mine, and we order one to go for someone else back at work. We sit there for 45mins without receiving our food before having to track down the waitress (because no one bothered to check on us). We tell the waitress to just bring out food out to-go because now we have run out of time and need to get back to work. 5 mins later we get our food and 2 out of 3 orders are wrong! One was a completely different meal than what was ordered. i ask how long it would take to re-make them and we are told about 17mins. At this point we have 10mins to get back to work. Needless to say, we ended up leaving and going back to work without getting to eat any lunch. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Quand il s'agit de l'arrondissement Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, rien ne bat March \ u00e9 Maisonneuve. Du Dauphinois pour les l \ u00e9gumes \ u00e0 Merci pour les \ u00e9pices, ou Premi \ u00e8re Moisson pour le pain, c'est le march \ u00e9 pour le quartier. Les gens ont tendance \ u00e0 parler du March \ u00e9 Jean-Talon, et bien s \ u00fbr, il est plus grand et plus conn \ u00fbt, mais quand \ u00e0 lui, le March \ u00e9 Maisonneuve est tout aussi bon, sinon meilleur pour sa taille. La s \ u00e9lection de fromages de la Fromagerie est aussi spectaculaire que celle de Jean-Talon et si vous \ u00eates un habitant de HOMA, il n'ya vraiment aucune raison de faire le trajet suppl \ u00e9mentaire. Si vous venez d'emm \ u00e9nager dans Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, vous devez vous assurer de v \ u00e9rifier cela car je suis s \ u00fbr que vous allez acheter la plupart de vos courses \ u00e0 ce fantastique march \ u00e9. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When it comes to the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough, nothing beats March \ u00e9 Maisonneuve. From the Dauphinois for veggies to Merci for spices, or Premi \ u00e8re Moisson for the bread, this is THE market for the neighbourhood. People tend to go on and on about March \ u00e9 Jean-Talon, and sure, that one's bigger, but when it comes down to it, March \ u00e9 Maisonneuve is just as good, if not better for its size. The cheese selection in the Fromagerie trumps those in Jean-Talon and if you're a local, there really is no reason to make the extra commute. If you just moved to Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, you need to make sure to check this out as I am sure you will be purchasing most of your groceries from this fantastic market. ",0,0,0,1,0

 AMAZING. Oh Raku, how I love thee! So glad you are located in Las Vegas, because otherwise, I may be visiting you all the time. Fresh, homemade tofu, Foie Gras on a stick, Uni, fresh sashimi, sake sampler, special import beer... Just a few of my favorite things. And, for all that and more, a $45 pp bill. Really reasonable! Can't wait to return to try their special chef's omakase. It requires letting the chef know ahead of time and I think is about $150 a person. I am sure it'll be decadent and completely AMAZING.

 This burger bar, a place I usually want to come visit when I visit Charlotte, offers up a pretty tasty burger, though not the best I've ever had. The reason I like it so much isn't because the actual burgers are that amazing, but because of the huge variety of stuff you can get on top of said burgers. It's amazing, and most turn out more deliciously than you can imagine. My favorite is the Frenchie, which is brie, apples, bacon, and garlic aioli on a turkey burger - which I almost always switch out for beef. There aren't many places you can get brie and apples on a burger, and I'm pretty obsessed with it. There are a billion other choices like that, or you can construct your own weird burger (the last time we went, a friend got grilled pineapple, queso, and bacon on a turkey burger... and she loved it). The sides are also tasty, but not really the main draw for me. Everyone seems to like the sweet potato fries here, which I actually think are really bland without the sauce, and I like a good sweet potato fry that stands up without sauce. These don't. The regular fries are good, similar to Five Guys, as are the tater tots, which are pretty standard, but nice and crispy, which I appreciate. Ask for some sauces (chipotle ranch? yes.) to improve your potato-based experience. OK, now for a few cons -- it's always so crowded, and loud inside. Expect to wait in the parking lot for a parking space, and inside for a table unless you're incredibly lucky or come at like 11 am on a Tuesday. Because it's always so busy, the wait staff can be hit and miss too. Most of my experiences have been pretty good, once you actually sit down. With regards to the actual meat, I feel they could improve in this area. They obviously don't grind their own sirloin, which is pretty surprising AND disappointing for a so-called burger bar. Because of this, you can't get a burger cooked less than medium. No favorite burger of mine is ever going to be more than medium-rare, so this is very sad for me. I do have to say that the beef burger was remarkably juicy for being cooked medium and not being fresh-ground. In conclusion, if you're a burger purist seeking out the best burger on the planet, this place isn't going to have it. But if you're a burger adventurist and want to put all kinds of weird stuff on your burger, then you'll love it here. Worth a try for anyone. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've eaten here twice; once on each of my last two trips to Madison. I'll eat here again before I leave. I am somewhat a creature of habit. When I try an ""Italian"" restaurant I want to know if it is ""Italian"" or ""italian"". This is easy to do. Order the marinara. It is a simple dish that most places don't bother to do right. But a real Italian restaurant will take the time to do this right. That means sauteing tomatoes and spices together, but knowing when to stop. And none of that ""al dente"" nonsense with the noodles...that's for fat Gourmands in bowties without friends, not for people who just like good food. I am pleased to say Johnny's gets it right. The gravy was magnificent--neither acidic nor sweet with lots of tomato and oregano flavor. MMMMM MMM! I had a ""side Caesar salad"" which was made with crisp, fresh, clean lettuce, parmigiano cheese, and a tangy, but not quite excellent dressing. It seems to lack the fishy flavor from the anchovy paste. Some folks leave that it, but if you do, that is NOT Caesar dressing. The anchovy is the core of a good Caesar. I took my order to go, and that is where the fifth star went. $10 for a plate of spaghetti and nothing else. The menu says it is served with garlic bread but I received this neither when dining in nor when to go. Also, don't be so stingy with the napkins and not so cheap on the plasticware...the knife needs to be strong enough to support a noodle. The staff are friendly at the bar, professional elsewhere if not overtly engaging. Overall, a very pleasant experience and, as I said, I will be back! ",0,0,0,1,0

 When I am craving pizza, I always order a cheese pizza from this place. I have tried the pizza with toppings but be careful how many you have them put on because the crust is so thin and can't hold all the toppings so well. Now if you are a fold your pizza and eat it kind of person, ignore my previous statement! I'm just not a ""fold and eat"" kind of girl, and prefer cheese pizza anyway. Veggies are cut fresh and the crust is from back east. The garlic knots are so tough and hard they can break a window, I do not recommend wasting your money on them. The ""East Coast Calzone"" is actually pretty tasty and worth the money. I just ordered it today and really liked it. I asked for a side of sauce and it was really good. My hubby likes a lot of the chain pizzas, but I would prefer this type over them any day. If you go to http://www.uppercrustpizza-lasvegas.com/ then you can see the menu and check out what deals and coupons they have going on. I have tried the garlic knots several times and like I mentioned before, I just don't like them (wish I did) however the pizza and calzones hit the spot. ",0,0,1,0,0

 What can I say that hasn't already been said about this wonderful bar that smartly combines booze with movies. To be honest I didn't much care for the movie selection here, so I put off checking this place out for a while. A group of us decided to stop by ""Palace"" (held every saturday night at filmbar in the lounge) one nighte to see Djentrification spin (best dj in the valley!) some worldly jams. Filmbar doesn't look like much from the outside, but give it a chance! Inside is a totally different story! Beautifully decorated, they serve up some great local (and foreign) beers, and offer a very intimate atmosphere! Tuesdays offer stand up comedy, while Thursday through Saturday Filmbar plays host to some of the most talented disc jockeys Phoenix has to offer! Throwback Thursdays are really cool if you dig old school hip hop! We finally did see a movie here a few weeks ago... Melancholia. Pretty depressing flick, but interesting to say the least.

 Feel as though this place was between three and four stars. The hungry housemates and I had a coupon for a free 12 inch pizza with purchase of any extra large 'za. With a 5 buck contribution from each, we had an X-large veggie with the free cheese pie. The double thick crust on the veggie was not noticeably thicker than the thin crust on cheese. Cheese pizza was better, somehow. Veggie tolerable, with all fresh toppings, but one housemate emphatically stated the cheese was the best plain pie she'd ever had. Not the best ever, but completely serviceable. Quick delivery for a Sat evening. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We just went for brunch and ordered their eggs benedict and french toast. The french toast was delightful and the only complaint about the eggs benedict was the sausage was more turkey burger than sausage. The kale was a unique touch, but my plate had a bit too much of it. Luckily, it was easy to remove the excess to my liking. The atmosphere was fine for a Saturday brunch and I really love the fact that they have only local beers on draft. Biggest complaint was that our waitress was HORRIBLE. It took her 15 minutes to take our order, and then we never saw her again, except for when she passed over our table every 5 minutes walking to her other two tables. We never had a single refill ofnour drinks, she never checked to see if our order was correct, never even acknowledged that we were eating there and when I finally flagged her down for my check, all she said was ""sorry"". (In my opinion, if you are overwhelmed with 3 tables, you should find a new career). We will go back to this place since the menu looks so good, but I can't see this being one of our regular places.

 Via Brazil was a 3 star restaurant in my previous review 3 days ago. That's nothing to be ashamed about.... it just means the restaurant was nothing great, but not terrible TO ME. Yelp is a site for posting your opinions. But some guy named Dustin J. had to send me a private message saying: ""We are very sorry that Our Happy Hour is too expensive for you. Please visit McDonalds, Taco Bell and other fast foods if this is too expensive for you"" It took me a minute to figure out what restaurant he was referring to, but when I found 20 photos for Via Brasil, I figured it out Congratulations, guys, I will never return to your restaurant and will make sure nobody I ever talk to does either.

 The salesman, Will, was great. He was very easy going and knew plenty about the car we test drove. Unfortunately, his sales manager, Cassidy, was incredibly pushy and refused to give us a price on the car. He kept asking what our budget would allow and when we responded by asking what the best he could was, he wouldn't budge from the sticker price. That is, until we started walking out, then he started yelling after us to come back and we could ""finally talk."" It's ashame really. Car buying should not be so frustrating. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I was looking into doing a short sale or foreclosure for my home but wasn't sure which was the best option for me and my family. Becky Cholewka sat down with us way after closing time and helped educate us on the different options. She was extremely thorough in going over each one and was super patient, friendly and accomodating. She never made me feel like I was asking the wrong questions and never pressured us to leave even after we had taken up quite a bit of her valuable time.

 Kind of hidden in a non-descript shopping strip, this mom & pop place is a great find. I've only tried their meats - beef, lamb, and chicken. Lamb is the best. The choices are kind of limited. Seems like half the menu are kebabs, but they are so tasty. If the prices look a bit high, the portions that come out justify that. The grilled meats rest on a huge plate of flavored rice. I can usually save half for lunch the next day. Some of their desserts look tempting but I never have room for them. Maybe I will order some to take out next time. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I came to Vegas for a conference, and I did not stay here. I have been to Vegas several times, and I have never stayed here. Although the food and shopping are great, it just seems as though this is the first of the ""big"" hotels that is starting to go down hill. With all of the newer hotels around, it seems as though it is time for this big boy to get a major overhaul. At the time, I am sure that it was the best of the best, but over the last 20+ years, this place has really taken a beating. When compared to the Venetian, Bellagio, Wynn and others, this place is struggling to keep up. Several of the tables where we were gambling were also filled with very grumpy dealers. I can understand that higher buy in tables having a more experienced person with expectation of players knowing what they are doing. However when you are with a bunch of non gamblers, you go to the low buy in tables and expect a little bit of latitude in your play. I have even been impressed at other casino's that they are even willing to help you learn the games, thereby staying there longer to lose your money. Not here, and will probably be a long time before I lose my money here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Our family had dinner here before a Pirates game last night. We had been looking forward to eating here after reading many positive reviews. The service was excellent and the drinks were good. Our kids both had Mac & Cheese with the pulled pork (no chorizo) and it was ok, but too much cheese for the mac, and the pork did not work well with it. My husband had the Korean Reuben, and he said it was way too salty, as were the fries. He also said the pungency of the kimchee overwhelmed the sandwich, and he couldn't taste any of the other flavors. I had the fish and chips and they were awesome. The fish was skate, and it was really delicious - lightly breaded and fried, but not greasy. The taste of the fish dominated, and that was a good thing. The chips followed the theme of being too salty. Overall, it was disappointing. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Came here with a couple of family members on a Wednesday night. One of them had a gift card and was eager to give this place a shot. Its a good thing she had a gift card because the prices were on the high side. I sort of expected that given this place is in the Biltmore area, and I'm usually willing to pay a premium if the food matches the hype. Did it? The place was packed, so before I could even think about my food I had to shout across the table just to hold a conversation. Yeah, its loud in there. Our server was very friendly, though we had to ask her repeatedly to speak up to hear her over the noise. We started with the grilled artichokes with remoulade. This hit the spot since I love artichokes and each had a perfect char. For my main course, I got the French Dip (in part because my brother claimed it was the best in town). It was one of the better ones I've had as they used good quality cuts of meat for the sandwich. For dessert I shared a brownie with nuts and ice cream with the table. It was adequate, but didn't wow me. So let's get to the price breakdown. Artichokes? $13. French Dip w/side salad? $25. Brownie? $12. So before tip, it was $60 just for the food I ordered (never mind the food my other two family members ordered). Maybe its just me, but if I'm gonna drop that much dough, I'd better be getting a fantastic meal. The meal, sadly, was not fantastic. It was adequate, even good in some spots, but not fantastic. And the items I ordered were actually on the cheaper end of the menu. Most of their main entree items are $35 and up. What this place brings to the table in terms of friendly service, an elegant atmosphere, and artfully crafted food simply doesn't measure up in terms of intimacy, flavor, or prices. I might be tempted to try this place again on AZ Restaurant Week or another promotion when restaurants like this slash their prices, but would not come here again on a regular night. Not enough bang for the buck. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Overall, I would not return to this restaurant nor recommend it. Small tables and cramped. The waiter spoke so fast that we had to have him repeat the specials three times. He served us so fast that I got the feeling he really didn't want us there! We felt uncomfortable even asking him questions and pointing out our issues with one of the entrees. I had the veal piccata and it was perfect! The wine was excellent, but our other three guest where extremely dissapointed. The veal chop is much smaller than it used to be. One pasta dish was served very dry and at a cool tmperature. We sent it back. Bread was just ok. Not the amazing kind that you expect in an Italian place. The other dish was just so so.

 i stopped in this evening at the loathing thought of having to cook during finals week. I decided to walk in so i could take my time looking at the menu.

I stepped up to the counter and Jacob was eager to help me pick out something, making several recommendations of items on the menu he liked. I decided to go with the crispy chicken sandwich. When i got home and opened my box, i realized that this was the first time i had ever gotten fast food and what i ordered actually looked as good as the picture! the taste did not let me down one bit either! overall, Culver's appears to be clean, staffed well with employees eager to help and give great service, and the food exceeds my expectations of what i would expect from a fast food joint.

Obviously, it comes with Mochiko Chicken and adds two Teriyaki Beef skewers, two Chicken Katsu skewers, and a couple of Shrimp Tempura. This is all served on a bed of rice with some salad on the side. It's always too much food and I had enough willpower this time to only eat about half of the bento.

 Went for the Zombie shooting thing with my buds and I was really pumped for it. The workers do a really good job of making you feel like you're in a first person shooter which got me pumped. There are 4 sections and you get 15 round for each section. I suggest taking your time and really utilizing your 15 rounds for each section because me and my friends didn't and it went by really fast. The zombies won't come up to you and hurt you but they do keep up with your pace if you run fast they kinda run fast if you run slow they run slow. Over all it was really fun i did feel like there was a lack of zombies in each section which was a bit of a let down. But when I did find any zombies it was cool trying to shoot them all. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My family and I have enjoyed being members of the Harris YMCA for about 10 years now. We have enjoyed summer camps, baseball, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, zumba, cycle classes and the exercise facilities in general regularly during that time. The staff is wonderful, and the facilities themselves are superbly maintained and run. The only problems relate to overcrowding. I regularly attend cycling classes in the mornings, and it has gotten to the point that I miss class and have to go back home (because I couldn't get a parking spot in time) about a third of the time. Bear in mind, that arriving ""in time"" means that I arr rive at least 30 minutes ahead of class time in order to stand in line for a pass. The problem is finding a parking spot in time. My wife has similar problems with zumba in the evenings, and finding parking for my sons soccer games has become almost impossible. Granted, the parking has been redesigned so as to allow additional capacity, but in doing so, they made the lanes and spaces very narrow. My car has been backed into once, narrowly missed several times, and sports multiple door dings from fellow members presumably all in a rush to make it to their classes/workouts/daycare on time as well. The annual membership drive makes me especially crazy, as this obviously pours fuel onto the fire. Between the parking woes, extra time involved to find parking, extra time to wait in line for class passes and damage to my car, the balance has finally tipped for me, and I am regretfully looking for a new place for us to work out.

 My sister suggested that we go here for dinner since I'd never been. We went at about 8pm on a Friday night, and it was a 20 minute wait. We started off with Edamame (which you can never go wrong with) and this shrimp appetizer that was really good. The shrimp is lightly battered and fried, and then they put this sweet and sour sauce over it. I really wanted to try one of the asian noodle dishes, but the waitress they were about a 6 on a scale of 1-10 spicyness, so I wasn't even going to try. I was happy with what I got instead though. I ended up getting the asian cabbage salad with macadamia nut chicken on top and a bowl of turkey chili. The salad was really good, but I definitely will ask for light dressing next time (I don't like to much dressing). The chicken in the salad was delicious! And the turkey chili was yummy and not too spicy for my taste. We ended our meal with the brownie with ice cream. The brownie was so moist and soft. I normally don't like brownies in restaurants because they're often dry, but this was not the case. MMMMMM!!! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Went here last night to get their 44oz water and a snack before work. When I ordered I was told my total and to pull forward. I was in the drive thru line for OVER 35 MINUTES!! Finally about 10 minutes at a standstill I asked one of the servers what the problem was; to which he rattled off a few kitchen machined were out of order and there was nothing he could do and quickly told me he would ""just cancel my order"". I replied ""excuse me?"" He sighed and walked off. Finally about 30 minutes after I ordered I asked to speak with the manager, who was polite and the only reason my rating isn't ZERO STARS! I explained I am irritated I have been in line for over a half hour because the machines weren't working and if I ordered something that required that machine why didn't they let me know it might take a while since by this point I am late for work!! Needless to say, horrible management, even worse customer service and I will NOT be returning to this location!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Way over priced. The deal here is to fill you up on overloaded French Fry's. The bill for 2 burgers, 2 Frys, and 2 drinks was $28.00. Even eating in, they must treat it like take out because our order came in a brown bag. So we had no tray, basket, or plates. They put the burgers in the bottom of the bag and filled 6"" of French frys on top of it. Way more than any one person would want to eat. Each order of frys looked like the equivalent of 2 whole potatoes. The only good thing I could say was the burger by itself was very good. It was cooked just right. Juicy and flavorful. Still, the price can't be overlooked. $28.00 for 2 people is too much for a lunch of fast food ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is a glorified fast food kind of place as I quote my sister, ""Hey, this looks just like a Chipotle!"" except for SkinnyFats has much more comfortable chairs and the space is really small. During the visit, we ordered a few items including... The Happy Mess - it's a bowl filled with truffle flavored fries, thin strips of steak and topped with tomato salsa and LOTS of blue cheese. The fries and steak themselves are really good with the ketchup. I don't think the cheese and salsa go well with fries but that's just me. Next time I think I will stick with the plain truffle fries instead. More Cow Bowl - a rice bowl filled with teriyaki beef, pineapple sauce and vegetables. They used too much sauce which made the whole plate super sweet and heavy. We hated this item. Ahi Tacos - I didn't try this item but my sister said it was okay. Not great, not horrible. Edamame with chili garlic glaze - The edamame was drenched in a sweet glaze. I think I prefer regular edamame with sea salt better. Over all - I'd come back here for fries but I'm not too crazy about the items we ordered. On a side note, they have fresh squeezed juice here and they're ~$9-10 per drink. That's pretty pricey!

 I took the one hour city tour on the river for $12/person. This place is so hard to find, I almost missed the boat!

 Here's the thing about OPH - I love it and I hate it. Let's start with why I hate it. 1. There is always a long wait and they have a tiny waiting area so you end up waiting outside in the heat. 2. They only take cash. I'm a debit card kinda girl. 3. The staff is not very friendly and they do not accommodate special orders - they may have blueberry pancakes and banana pancakes on the menu but if you want blueberry-banana pancakes you're outta luck. 4. It never seems very clean. 5. It's overpriced. So why do I keep going back? 1. The food. They have really good pancakes. Damn it. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This place is little more than a warehouse stuffed to the gills with pinball and other types of gaming machines. It's no frills, it's a little stuffy and warm inside...but boy, I could spend hours and hours here. I LOVE pinball and getting to play all different kinds just turns me back into a 12 year old. It was hubby's 40th birthday and his request was that we make a stop here during our visit to Vegas. This was our third time visiting but he wanted to make sure we spent more time here than before. We dragged three other people with us who ended up having some fun too. An older gentleman makes his rounds every once in a while (the ""curator"" of this museum), checking to make sure everyone was having fun. He was a kindly man who offered refunds when a machine would take your money and not give you any games. I lost about a buck but didn't think about getting a refund since I think this place is not-for-profit?? A couple of us scored some stick-on moustaches from one of the vending machines (a giant gumball machine) and walked around with our new facial hair. The afternoon was quite a delight and I believe my husband was extremely satisfied with his birthday request. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have heard a lot about this place and really had high hopes. I would have given it more stars but the service was effing horrendous. To the point where I almost got up and walked out. The waitress our table had (a small table of THREE girls) dropped off teh menu and avoided ALL EYE CONTACT for about an hour. She waited all the other tables around us and behind us and even BESIDE us but ours seemed to be an impossibility. After finally giving our order and getting our BOTCHED plates (I had ordered the beef poutine and got a regular one, which they still charged me $18), it took another 20 minutes to get ANOTHER waitress to our table to try and fix the mistake. All this and we haven't been able to place the drink orders because our waitress RAN AWAY after we gave our food order. The food itself was TO DIE FOR (once we got our full plates). The blue cheese and beef poutine is heavenly, the mayo they give you seems to be home-made and they burgers.... mmmmmmmmm. I wish i can give one rating for the service and another for the food. Going into a pub, i'm not looking for fantastic service however I'm not looking to go behind the bar and get my drinks either. I don't know if this woman was in her ""monthly"" time or what but let me tell you, she was unhappy with life and seemed to have a hatred for our table. This being said, AVOID the tall waitress with super short bleached hair because if she's in a bad mood, you'll leave there in a bad mood too but definitely go to try that poutine!!!!

 What on God's green Earth makes people think it's okay to go to a pool party when your gut sticks out farther than your tits/pecs?! I call that a ""stick out"". Geez, aren't you self conscious about that jiggle? Vegas pool parties, you're surrounded by the hottest bodies but then there is that handful of nastiness that makes my eyeballs bleed. And then these nasty bitches want to be on the pole and they can't even dance. Backf fat jiggling and all. Eww. You don't have to be super fit or skinny but, at least, don't be on the pole, thinking you're sexy. Don't even get me started on the hairy dudes. Wax that shit! *end of rant* Anyways, EBC was good. Great music. Food & drinks are yummy. We got a table for $1000 food & beverage minimum. Not bad at all. Our waitress was super hot AND friendly. Usually the hotter they are, the more unfriendly they are...but not our girl. 75% good looking people and great eye candy but 25% fatties (guys & girls). Security was super friendly too. And Michael Phelps made an appearance, looking like a stoned dolphin. The food was so good, especially the steak nachos and sea salt fries. I wanted to eat more but I was trying to keep the salt off my abs. I don't want to be a ""stick out"". We had bottles but we also ordered strawberry daquiries and they were delicious. I docked a star because the door goons were being shiesty. They were trying to make some extra bucks in their pockets. And when we said no thanks, they threatened to pull our guys out of the line or hold them back in line. Wack! Tip of the day: Walk carefully on the wet cement. I saw at least 3 chicks eat shit.

 What can I say I love this place. The food is always fresh and everything is hot. I have been here a lot and love to see the chef in the dining room talking with customers. I come from an Italian family and I have to say that their eggplant parm is better than my grandmother's. I do have two favorites the lasagna and manicotti always delight. I love the views at sunset, this place has the best views of Vegas. I'm not sure how they make their sauce but I can't get enough of it. I'm not sure why people would go to an Italian restaurant and get fish so I can't really comment on the fish but I've tried most of the menu and everything has been wonderful. I don't understand how people can say the food is bland, I'm Italian from an Italian family and I've been to a lot of Italian restaurants and have eaten Italian food my whole life, this place by far has the best tasting sauce, I wish I knew thier secret. The dining room has a lot of seating and the staff is always friendly and when they mention you by name shows class. I'm only giving 4 stars because nobody beats my grandmother's cooking and I leave that star for her. ",0,0,0,1,0

 First of all, my 5* rating is because of the food, not the atmosphere. The food is delicious! I love Joe's bbq sauce, it is perfect, sooo much better than many other places. All of the side items are yummy and fit in to the comfort-food category. I still have not tried any of the desserts, but they all look delicious....cakes, brownies, and huge old-fashioned root beer floats. The employees are all very nice. As far as the actual restaurant itself, it is very help-yourself, no-frills set-up. If the place is busy, which it usually is because the food is so good :) , you have to stand in a long line. Eventually, you reach the cafeteria style area, where you grab a tray, utensils, napkins, etc. I would not want to be eating at any of the tables or booths by the line with people standing there, watching me chow down. Once your order is taken at the next counter, you wait for your food, pay for it, and then find a place to sit. There is a big outdoor seating area which is nice if you have kids. I just wish they served a nice cold beer here, but they do not. Guess that would ruin the family type atmosphere. Fortunately, Postino's and Oregano's is right across the street if you decide you do want to have a before or after dinner drink. You can also order-to-go outside the building, this is definitely a plus. ",0,0,0,0,1

 For Sunday brunch: Issues mostly related to poor service and it was not crowded yet. One of our orders was incorrect and the waitress never checked to see if things were ok.

 I loved Four Peaks more when I drank copious amounts of beer. However, even if I have become a one pint a sitting guy, I still adore Four Peaks with equal ardor. At one point I sampled all the beers when I friend visiting from out of town. That's really unnecessary now because I wouldn't order anything other than the Peach Ale. Call me a sissy. I will be very content with my fruity and wheaty libation. You can have your manly stout. The food is stellar too. The cheese beer bread might be a caloric disaster, but its one of those Beauty falls in love with the Beast things. One simply cannot resist.

 Me and some friends went here after a few rounds of drinking and the pizza was awesome. I have been in Charlotte for 20 years and have never been to a fuel pizza before! The crust was the perfect thickness, a little thinner than most with a touch of crispiness. The sauce was awesome - loved the herbs in it, the cheese was nicely melted and the pepperoni and mushrooms were plentiful. I ate four slices of the large pizza - I topped it with alot of red pepper flakes and grated parmesan. I meant to take a picture, but the pizza did not last long. We sat outside too b/c the weather was so nice. Great location, except for the homeless people asking for cash for bus fare. I AM going back....often! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Cheesy interior, crowded, average music selection in the back dance floor. Despite all that, Tiki Lounge can be fun if you're in the right frame of mind. It's a long narrow club with the obvious 'tiki' theming. But just get inside, have a few drinks at the basement bar (avoid the first level as it's always too overcrowded), hit the dance floor, pray they don't play too much Lady GaGa. The female bartender in the basement bar knows her stuff; the guy, not so much. It's a bit of a college/hot mess type of crowd but hey, sometimes we all need a little dirrty in our lives. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Lets start off with the rocky part. I called and spoke with a customer service representative before reserving our limo just to clear up a few things. My main question was, ""Are you going to WITHDRAW the funds RIGHT NOW? Or are you going to wait until you drop us off at the airport before charging our card? The C.S.R. was clear by stating, ""We will NOT charge you until we drop you off."" With this mis-information they debited my card that day and over-drew my account. It really irritated me because, it wasn't that we didn't have the funds to pay for it, we just didn't have it in the bank THAT DAY. I was gonna head down and make a deposit before our trip to ensure all funds were there. I called back and explained my situation. I explained that their error ended up costing me 30 bucks, and was at least hoping for a refund of the over draft fee, or a limo upgrade, or even an extra bottle of bubbly!?!?! SOMETHING!!!!! The CSR on the phone sounded as if it was no problem. She put me on hold, and came back with, ""My manager said it states on our site that once you your reservations are made, you will be charged, sorry!"" After a bit more arguing, they told me I can cancel at anytime up to 24 hours before the reservation. I seen mixed reviews on Google, (didn't know about this wonderful thing called yelp yet) but i rolled the dice and let it ride. When we got to McCarran to pick up our bags, A sharply dressed chauffeur had our name on a laminated sign, standing right in front of the carousel. It was a surprise for my wife, she thought we had a shuttle bus picking us up. And she was really confused about why a shuttle bus would pick us up with our names on a laminated sign. When we got outside, there was black stretch limo awaiting us. It came with a bottle of champagne and a red rose for my wife. The car was super clean, and the driver was VERY VERY professional and extremely kind. He took pictures of us, drove us to a local liquor store, he loaded all our luggage, opened doors for us, just straight up treated us like royalty. If ANYTHING, that driver is what made the experience such a pleasant one for us. We'll be making reservations with them in 2 weeks when we head back down to Sin City. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is a great place for some pizza and wings. My most recent visit, I ordered a lunch special - a slice with garlic chicken, black olives, and roasted red peppers.

The wings are pretty tasty as well, and just a little bit different from most places - maybe a little crispier. The breadsticks that came out early were also good.

 Meh. I had high expectations for staying at the Hilton and was sadly disappointed. Aside from having the reservation wrong, there were other minor issues and one major that really put a bad taste in my mouth. We were short a bed, and where they graciously provided a roll away at 'no cost,' they neglected to provide a blanket with the roll away so we had to call housekeeping for one. Nice eh? And coffee. I would have loved to have had a coffee maker in the room. But no. I called housekeeping and asked, but was informed I needed to call room service and they would bring up a coffee maker. For a fee. For a fee. Super 8 provides them free! Maybe I have too high of expectations. Next morning, with no coffee in my system yet, I was ready for a hot shower. But no. No hot shower. Cold yes. Hot no. Called house keeping again and 40 minutes later someone arrived to run the faucet for 30 minutes before they declared the water was ""hot"". It was ""warm"" at best. The maintenance guy was nice though - he jokingly asked if we knew we were staying in the ghetto. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We are locals here in Vegas and have lots of time to investigate all of the casinos. I guess that is what you get when you have lots of time on your hands after retiring! The ""M"" Resort is a hidden gem and certainly has many people oohing and aaahing when they first visit! Our favorite place to unwind is the ""Hostile Grape"", a beautiful wine cave below the spa. They have a wonderful wine card program that allows you to purchase a card and then use it in the ""pouring machines"" to taste all types of wines. The wonderful folks who work there are amazing! It is so relaxing and they offer all types of appetizers for purchase as well. Although we like the Buffet, it is nothing fancy. The room is modern and feels more like a Cafeteria. It is full of wonderful tasty food and you certainly won't go without. The best Buffet they offer is the ""Sunday Brunch"" when they offer wine and champagne as part of the price! The food is top drawer and they even bring out the wonderful ""Baby Cakes"" (gourmet cupcakes) cupcakes on the dessert bar. HEAVEN!!!! The ""M"" is a more upscale, clean, local casino/bar/restaurant establishment and we have come to enjoy our time there very much. Definitely NOT the ""STRIP""! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was craving Persian food and I stumbled upon this place in my search. I ordered the kefta platter with fatoush and hummus. Overall I enjoyed the food but it was definitely not the best I've had.

The kefta, fatoush and hummus were all pretty good but the rice was *plain* and the bread was thin and limp much like a tortilla. The other thing that annoyed me was that they piled everything high onto a small plate. Service was good, nothing to mention there but they are really nice people.

 When I first went to Gates and Brovi a few months ago, I was an almost instant fan. The restaurant is a a good place to go with a family or group of friends, especially with the two large picnic-style tables that are fun for groups of friends or a party. The food is American, with a menu that sways towards being seafood-centered. Indeed, the seafood is reasonably good for a land-locked area. The d \ u00e9cor is an interesting and fresh take on a north woods supper club combined with what seems to be a New England clam shack or seafood place. The owners took these two modest but character-filled venues and spiffed it up a ton, with high ceilings and large windows that fill the room with natural light at lunchtime. Hardwood floors and vintage north woodsy shiny beer signs give the place a nostalgic but also cool and fresh look. Most design elements are tasteful and a good bit kitschy. The seating is mostly wooden, so it takes a little bit of a hit on comfort. However, there is a table and seating that can please everybody. There are traditional tables and chairs, bar stools at the bar, booths, high padded seats around a table, and even two wood picnic tables that I mentioned earlier. Recently, Gates and Brovi expanded their menu to a double-sided page, which added lots of items that can appeal to many tastes. The crowd favorite, and one that I would highly recommend for any newcomer to this restaurant, is the G & B burger. It is divine, with a delicious sauce and a goey, drippy, richness. As with a good amount of their other menu items, the burger requires more than a few of the flimsy paper napkins. Also good to try is the beer steamed shrimp. Soaking in a delicious -broth? -brine? each shrimp absorbs loads of rich flavor, and compensates for the average seafood that is served. Appetizers are delicious and there is a good amount to choose from. The fries are a good thing to automatically get if you are with other people, because the large size comes with a lot and is the cheapest of the appetizers. The fries are perfectly hot and crispy and have just the right amount of oiliness. My brother had the cheese curds one time and said they were very awesome. One downside is that the brown sugar roasted pork sandwich is so choked with greens and a soggy slop that it was hard to pick out the pork flavor, which didn't have that much flavor anyway (Where was the brown sugar part of it? I couldn't taste it). Many things are very messy and soggy and require lots of napkins. There is one mediocre paper napkin that comes with your silverware but that runs out pretty quickly. There are dispensers on each table, but each napkin that comes out of those is so flimsy and thin that you end up having a huge pile of wadded-up paper at the end of your meal. Service is a strong point, with wait staff that are friendly and courteous. When my mother got the wine she ordered, it came not quite as chilled as some might like it. The waitress was very helpful and offered to refrigerate it for longer, which worked. When the wine came back, it was a good deal colder but still in a non-stemmed beer-like glass. Apparently they do not have stemmed glasses for wine, so you have to have it in a regular beer sampler glass. Other users have mentioned parking being a problem, although I live close and usually walk there. It is true that there is no parking lot in the daytime, and you have to resort to side streets. After 7:00 you can park in the Mallatt's parking lot, which is right next to the restaurant. Along with their expanded menu, they also added a parking diagram which handily points out which streets are good to park on. All in all, this is a great place to take the family, or the relatives in town, or anybody for that matter. The food is amazing, especially for the price you pay and the portion size you get.

 We've been to Kona Grill a few times to hit up their Happy Hour special. It runs from I think 3-7 then again from 10-12 weekdays, Saturdays its during the afternoon (I can't recall the exact times), and Sunday it's all day. I'd have to say that it gets pretty crowded during the Happy Hour times - especially if you're going during the week after work or something. There's normally open seating at the sushi bar if you don't mind though. I like it here. The food is a great value with their Happy Hour pricing. They have a list of apps at half off and also some other items for 6 bucks... as well as some drinks for half off. Their food is quality, ambience is great, service is not bad considering how busy it always is too. I've tried almost all the sushi on their Happy Hour Menu and to me, it's just OK. Get the wave roll, it's pretty refreshing (I don't think it's a steal at 6 bucks though). I also like the Crab Crunch I think it's called. Other than that, I can't think of anything else that jumps off as awesome. If you are looking for amazing sushi, go to a Japanese restaurant. My favorite thing, however, is the two burgers for 6 bucks. They are smaller sized burgers with a side of fries. The meat is top quality and its its topped off with a bunch of great tasting things. I like it and order this every time. I normally like pot stickers, but I'm not crazy about the ones here (my friends think opposite, they like them). The meat in it is loose and doesn't stick together. I think that's why it puts me off. Anyway, the lettuce wraps are good, the calamari is good... everything is pretty good. Not OMG, but good! This is definitely one of the more generous happy hour spots in terms of their specials and times that they offer the great deals. ",0,0,0,1,0

 You would think that if your called Dunkin Donuts that you would at least get the donuts right. Arrived about 10:00 AM on a weekday.

One of the restrooms was out of order and from the look of the out of order sign on the door, it had been for quite a while. No drive thru. If I am going to partake of useless calories and carborhydrates, I at least want it enjoyable. They do have free WiFi. ",0,1,0,0,0

 So, last Saturday, my friends and I flew out to Vegas to have some fun and decided on The Cosmopolitan for our first night out. A very mixed experience! First we headed over to STK where we had dinner and then decided to have a drink at the bar but quickly decided to go elsewhere because the 2 ladies behind the bar were rude. We made our way over to Vesper. Wow! So much talent with a friendly welcome. The drink was so good and I highly recommend it! Now comes to our final destination: The Chandelier Bar. We settled in to the second floor but not for long. We sat next to the service station and notice something disgusting. A drink was sitting there with the drink ticket INSIDE THE DRINK. YUCK! I took a picture and posted it here on Yelp. Needless to say, I would never go back to Chandelier. And it kind of makes me wonder what else happens behind the scenes at the other venues. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I recently was in charge of hosting a meeting for an organization I'm affiliated with at the neighboring UNLV campus. A handful of members in my organization, including myself, booked rooms through Alexis Park. Generally speaking, we all had a great time and positive experience. I booked a large, 2 bed suite for a very reasonable price. While the rooms themselves look pretty out-dated, Alexis provides a lot of great amenities. The staff here is real friendly and easy to work with. Although the location isn't on the strip, it is right across the street from the Hard Rock and there are a handful of good restaurants/liquor stores in walking distance. The only real con was the showers. The bathtub in our room looked like the Hulk got into a fight in it; there was huge cracks in the wall and tub itself. Would be cool if they could renovate these. Other than that, I would definitely look into staying here again in the future! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ruben and I came for dinner with two of our friends based on their recommendation. I have to admit that I was weary, as I usually am with sushi restaurants. I also already have my sushi spots and until something goes wrong, I have no plans on straying. The nigiri and hand rolls were good and I liked the Tiger Roll (Shrimp tempura, cucumber with spicy tuna, avocado, and eel sauce) and Dancing Eel Roll (Shrimp tempura, cucumber with spicy tuna, unagi, and eel sauce). I also enjoyed the Ahi Poke (white onions and seaweed salad) and shrimp and vegetable tempuras. Otherwise, nothing special or memorable. I'm a little surprised how much everyone likes this place. It wasn't terrible, but I was not impressed in any way. I think the lines between AYCE sushi restaurants start to blur a little because offerings are the same or very similar, so after trying a few restaurants, something needs to stand out. Perhaps if I had tried Kaya first, I may have liked them better. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This dark cellar with low ceiling makes me think Don Barzini (ref: Godfather) is in there and when I take a photo of my food, he will direct his goons to take my camera. A busy Friday night required reservations. The good thing about this place is dinners come with veggies, potatoes and table side salad. I had the lobster bisque as an appetizer with my lamb chops. The bisque wasn't what I was expecting. I only had lobster bisque at one other place. That was William B's in the old defunct Stardust. That soup rocked and this one was meh in comparison. Not very much goodies in this smooth and creamy soup. Maybe this is the way it's supposed to be and William B's did it wrong. I just liked B's better. The table side salads were a great touch. I had the classic ceaser which was one of the best ceasers i've had. My lamb chops medium rare were a bit tough, but it was still flavorful. They served it with a gravy that had a hint of habenero that kicked it up a notch. The rest of my family had the 16 oz prime rib, the roasted chicken, and the beef wellington. We also had a side of king crab legs to share. This was plenty of food. I ended up getting half a wellington and more than my share of crab legs. Needless to say, I didn't have the opportunity to de-bone the lamb chops. I would have loved to knawl all the good meat next to the bones, but there was too much food and in Vegas, what happens at the dining table stays at the dining table. A very big meal and worthy of 4 stars. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have now been here three times, twice for dinner and once for breakfast. All three times I left disappointed and wishing I had just gone to In-N-Out. On the most recent visit I tried the nightly special of NY strip with baked potato. I don't expect a cut rate steak to be cooked to perfection, or even to be that good, but this was one of the worst pieces of beef I have ingested in years. The midrare steak came out well, well, well done and was not visibly discernible as being a NY strip. As this was a cut rate steak I kept my complaint between my wife and I, but then when I attempted to take a bite of baked potato (obviously microwaved and not baked) it was as hard as the fork. When the server came over I tapped my fork against the potato and commented it was barely cooked. She asked if I wanted another one (really?) and I said yes. The next micro potato arrived after everything else had been eaten. One would think the kitchen staff who cut the potato in half would not have served it, but alas they clearly do not care. Out of all three trips, I don't think there was any item that was not directly out of a bag, can, mix or otherwise brought in. ",1,0,0,0,0

 A review for their mani/pedi. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. You would think a name like Canyon Ranch Spa at THE VENETIAN would provide top notch quality for their mani/pedis but boy was I in for a surprise. First the mani/pedis are done in the salon on the Palazzo side - which meant i had to walk really far from the Venetian to get to my appointment. I got there on time and they made me wait for over 10 minutes. I was already irked because I have a limited amount of time in vegas and that precious time should be not be spent waiting. The whole vibe felt like I was in a busy grocery store. It was so loud in there and too many people bustling around. I thought i would be able to relax at the ""spa"" but it was so noisy and my technician was kind of weird. She was awkward to talk to so I just gave up and stared over her shoulder while she did my nails. Before we started she asked me to soak my fingers and the water was boiling hot! I asked her to add some cold water in and she said ""oh no it's ok it's just something for you to do while i get ready"". Um ok, I just scald my fingers and you don't even apologize?? She filed my nails into a decent shape but her painting skills definitely lacked. My nails looked so goopy and thick afterward. She tried to clean the polish on my finger and cuticle by dipping a brush into nail polish remover. I've seen this done before but her technique wasn't really good and she left my nails with dual layers like she couldn't really paint my nails correctly. To top it off, she messed up my thumb. Instead of starting over (which she should have) she just dipped her finger into nail polish remover and tried to smooth it out. It was so obvious and ugly! She was definitely rushing to get me to my pedicure appointment because she was so behind and loopy. The pedicure was just ok. They had the spa whirlpool chairs which I don't like because I'm paranoid of germs. There was nothing special to the pedicure. The guy (yes a dude and i'm sorry but i really don't like men giving me pedicures. It just creeps me out) pumiced the bottom of my feet so much that by night time i felt the soles of my feet hurting. I think he may have overdid it. My toe nails chipped after 1 day. Finger nail polish stayed in tack for almost a week. I did go back to talk to someone about the lack of quality of the services but all they offered was to redo my nails and toes. I really didn't have the time or patience to go through it again. Worst $150 i ever spent on myself! Yes it cost big bucks and it sucked! (1 star bonus for letting me keep the nail polish) ",0,1,0,0,0

 For starters my review is based solely on the environment and the service we received. We went for my husbands birthday after hearing from a few of our neighbors that they had great wings. When we walked in our first impression was we had interrupted the hostesses from a conversation and they had to stop it to seat us. (Since we all get paid to sit around and talk versus work) When we got to our table our waitress came by and asked for our drink orders. After ordering a drink off the menu she looked at me as if I was making up a drink. Finally I gave up and just got a water. After we placed our food order the kitchen got our order wrong and had to remake it, but when the food came out and I explained what I had ordered they gave me a look like ""are you really going to make me take this back"" finally my order came out and my food wasn't bad. The sauces we got were great. But the reason for not being satisfied was our server didn't come over one time to apologize for the mis-order or to explain how long it'd be till it was ready. We had to flag her down to get our bill and when talking to her she turned and walked away during mid conversation of asking for wet napkins. We kept looking for the manager but was unable to locate him. He was circling the restaurant looking dissatisfied. As did all the other servers, like they didn't want to be there at all. Like I said not pleased by the poor service. Or lack of hospitality from this wing chain. But liked the wings. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My SO and I made our Valentine's Reservations here, and were extremely happy. The Good: -The goat cheese, the goat cheese, the goat cheese!! We had several tapas and one appetizer, and the fried goat cheese was our favorite, so delicious and creamy, and it is served with a light jam that makes a wonderful combination. -The pork tacos were also delicious, and obviously slow cooked, very delicious. -The service was excellent, especially for how busy everything was (they were tripled booked for Valentine's). -The homemade ricotta gnudi were also delicious, especially with the sauteed mushrooms that accompanied it. -We also ordered a flight of ice cream that featured a mint chocolate cake flavor which was extremely aromatic, and smelled like I was walking through an herb garden, delicious. The Meh: -Personally, I was not a fan of the arancini, to me all I could taste was a fried greasy taste. Overall: -Would definitely return! Especially for date night, it's a fantastic place.

 The service at this Feast Buffet makes the GVR Feast Buffet seem like a 5 star restaurant in comparison! First of all, this one also has the ridiculously long breakfast lines that, when you're hungry, feel like they're taking a year to get through. Drink service isn't nearly as good as at Green Valley. I asked for whipped cream in my hot cocoa and they told me to get it myself from the dessert bar. Really? And they don't have the same things as GVR. I went to get a bagel and they only had the mini ones. I guess that's why GVR is more expensive, but I'll drive a little further and spend a couple of extra bucks next time if I really must have breakfast buffet. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I feel bad about giving him 2 stars but the show really wasn't that great. If he had a bigger venue - with a bigger budget - maybe that would enhance the show. The dancers were offbeat and lethargic. They had the ex-stripper look. The ushers immediately moved our party to the 2nd row on the left - to which we could see nothing - so we went back to our original seats - all before curtains up of course. The show started late which was unacceptable for me. But after being lied to about it being a sold out show and despite allowing people to be seated while the show began - the 3 rows in front of us were completely empty. The ushers kept walking back and forth in front of us during the show and it was very distracting. I couldn't believe how unprofessional they were. The magic was duddy and easily figured out. My family was wow'd. I wasn't. I still feel really bad for giving Steve such a negative review but there was 6 of us and at $70/seat the show just wasn't worth the money. Sad face. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Had lunch here. Service was pretty good. They were very good about ensuring we had enough chips and salsa. (Providing chips and salsa should be a mandatory thing for mexican food places, but I've actually been to some that don't. I haven't been back.) Ordered a green chile burrito, enchilada style, and split it with my girlfriend. Honestly, for the price, I was expecting something more. A teaspoonful of refriend beans, and perhaps an ounce of rice, accompanied a burrito that couldn't have been more than maybe 6 or 8 ounces. The flavor was good, and the food was delicious, but the value was certainly lacking. It's not likely that I'll return. Which is unfortunate for them and me, given I work just a few blocks away.

 A bit unfair to all the other microbrews in town, but obviously Peaks has been a staple in the Tempe area for decades for good reason. All the beer is brewed on site which means everything is fresh -- they actually use the same water they serve at the tables in the brewing process, to give you an idea how pure the finished product is. No matter if you're there to eat or knock a few back Peaks is a must. You can't go wrong with virtually anything on the menu but anyone happening upon Peaks for the first time should absolutely order an entree or side of the fries, an undisputed favorite. I usually go with anything involving blackened chicken, be it salad or nachos. The sampler trey is offered at a reasonable price and provides about 4 oz servings of each of the beers listed on the big board. If you're looking for something lighter I would suggest the Sunbru or Peach -- my personal favorite is doing a half & half of Oatmeal Stout with Peach. Get inventive. The staff is used to working with a lot of traffic so I've never had bad service there -- these guys really know their stuff! ",0,0,0,0,1

The lighting & French music is absolutely perfect & everything is very charming. The food was great! We did the 5 course menu & come hungry because it's a lot of decadent food.

 Elizabeth Creamery serves up a great variety of ice cream flavors. I'm partial to banana-flavored desserts, so I tend to get the banana ice cream. But they've got tons of interesting flavors to try. My only complaint would be that they really need outdoor seating for the summer months. The shop is in a great row of restaurants and businesses on Elizabeth Avenue. There's a lot of construction there right now, which can be frustrating, but don't let it deter you from an ice cream fix. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Very underwhelmed with this place. When my friend and I walked in on a wed evening, the place was just about empty. We sat at the bar, and something just felt off about the place. It could have been cause the presidential debate was on...I dunno. Anyhow, service could def be better. The bartender greeted us and asked for our drinks. As we were going to give the selection, another worker (possible manager) started talking to her. So we just sat there, waiting for him to finish before we could order. She brought chips and salsa. The chips were warm, but the salsa left a lot to be desired. The manager dude kept talking to her, so we had to wait for drinks. Again...there really wasn't anyone in there, and we had to wait. So finally we get to order food. I got the taco salad, he got a quesadilla. Food comes out, and we don't have silverware which she acknowledges. She went to get it, but again the manager dude starts talking, so again were waiting. 5 min later, and after asking another waiter for it, she finally delivers. Taco salad was bland. Meat barely had any flavor, and the taco shell was somewhat stale. Prices weren't all that great either, and both meals were not worth what we paid for. Will not be going back and I don't recommend you even waste your time here. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We went here for lunch after I read about it in Sunset Magazine. I liked it a lot. The corn was d'lish, as was the Carne Asada Burrito, though it was a tad small for $5.45. (They offer a larger one for $7.95) I guess I'm spoiled living in San Diego where I can get a Carne Asada burrito for super cheap! But I have to say the meat here was wayyyy better than most I've had at home. There was not ONE SINGLE bit of fatty gristle in my burrito. And the burrito was simply made with only a few ingredients (meat, guac, pico de gallo, and onions) so I could really taste the smoky goodness of the meat. I liked it a lot. In fact, I liked it so much I went there twice in one weekend! Try the corn with cotija cheese - YUM! And also make sure to drink one of America's Margarita's. I liked the Tamarindo but my husband liked the Jamaica. Heck, try both! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I bought a Kitchen Aid Mixer on December 6th at the Kitchen Collection Store at the Outlet Mall in Carlsbad, CA. It was given to my son and his wife for Christmas. When they got it out of the (NEW) box to use it, as the beaters turned, it made grinding noises. I called the KC in Carlsbad and explained what happened and that my son lives in Phoenix. They said to take it in with the receipt to any of the Arizona KC stores. My son and his wife and baby took a 40 mile trip to go to the Kitchen Collection store at Anthem. The experience they had was way less than pleasant. After lugging the Mixer in and presenting it (in the box with everything it came with) and the receipt to the person workiing at their register, my son was told that they don't take returns or exchanges on the kitchen aid items. My son told her what I had been told and also showed her on the bottom of the receipt that stated they DO accept returns and exchanges and she told him it was Company Policy not to do so on Kitchen Aid appliances. He asked if she had that policy in writing and she said ""NO, it is an understood policy and is not in writing."" After trying to talk with her and ask to speak with someone else, she was still rude. They were not nice and not helpful and did not follow the policy stated on their receipt. My son left with his Kitchen Aid Mixer, went home, called Kitchen Aid's 800 number and they are sending him a new one. Sad experience and the money I would have saved with a rebate, was spent on gas.

 We went to Wildfish for Valentine's Day...I was a little hesitant at first because for some reason I'd never heard anyone talk about it & I'm always a teeny bit wary of seafood restaurants anyway. I used to work in one...I think I'm scarred for life. I had no reason to worry here. I ate SO much here...& everything I put in my mouth was totally delicious. A manager started us off with a huge slice of cucumber topped with this delicious salmon stuff...as a welcome as first-timers in the restaurant. Now THAT is a way to get people coming back. That is huge for me. Such a nice surprise. We ordered a few sides as our appetizer. The boy got the truffle fries (we know how I feel about fries...I had to hold myself back). I ordered asparagus (perfectly cooked & just barely seasoned, I could eat that forever) & we split the truffled mac n cheese. OHHH. That stuff is so gosh darn good...I wanted a whole pot to myself. But we split it, so I didn't gain 5 pounds on the spot. Boytoy ordered the filet, oscar-style. They had to take it back for him to cook it a little more, but I think he just doesn't know what he likes. They were super nice & very fast bringing it back to him (with a little flashlight to check how well it was done!) He says it was one of the best steaks he has had in awhile. He also ordered a twice-baked potato with it that was just cheesy deliciousness. I ordered the ahi, because it seemed to be one of the more creatively prepared meals on the menu, & their ahi is wild...so I could eat it with a clear conscious (see below). The wasabi mashed potatoes that came with it made me laugh out loud. So good...who thought of that?! I just wish I had eaten less beforehand so I could have eaten more of my meal (seared rare fish isn't as good microwaved). My wine was good, our server was good...a little timid at times, but that was fine. We like to play around a little at dinner...I like a server who can hold their own, but all in all, a great special occasion dinner. It was a little pricey, but it's the Waterfront. ***DISCLAIMER: TREEHUGGER***I will say, they lost a star really only for having a selection of fish that was mostly on my ECO-WORST list! Fish is a tricky business lately. I will spare you the environmental lecture & just leave you with this: restaurants (especially in areas not close to the source) buy fish as cheaply as possible, which usually means fish that are dwindling in population (Chilean sea bass, etc) or collected in the wrong ways that kill other marine life or damage ecosystems (many kinds of tuna,etc). Just ask where your the fish you're ordering comes from. If the server doesn't know or obviously makes something up...you're in trouble anyway. ",0,0,0,1,0

 WORST HOTEL STAY OF MY LIFE! AVOID Hell Cortez Hotel! I travel a lot and complain very little but this hotel and their management team are both falling apart. I had my room packed up and moved on night 2 of my 3 night stay without my consent while at a family gathering. The El Cortez Hotel security who handled moving my bags took the liberty of looking through all my bags including confidential files in my briefcase. My mother was also staying at El Cortez Hotel with me (separate room) and when her A/C went out the staff refused to move her to a new room. It took me a hour with the front desk to get her in a new room and she likely would have remained in a scorching hot room without A/C had it not been for me wiping my fangs out with management!

 My husband and I have been here a few times and the food is amazingly good. I highly recommend the Fukuburger and the Karai (Spicy Burger). Both are excellent. I've tried the Tamago as well and the egg is just a little too heavy for me. But with a variety of other options and terrific fries, it's a great food truck for late night cravings. I also like that they are participating in pop up dinners (next one at Retro Bakery!). The one they hosted with Jet Tila of Wazuzu was amazing! The money curry, Thai me up sandwich, and chicken and waffles were all super delicious. Fukuburger staff did the cooking, showing that they are super versatile and talented. And pop up dinners are a great idea. I'm glad they are starting them in Las Vegas. Fukuburger is a valuable addition to the Las Vegas food community for doing this. When visiting this truck, keep in mind that their following is pretty young and you have to be in the mood to deal with it (see Elizabeth E.'s review - jackass teenagers pretty much sums it up). Also, there are some stickers on the truck that you may not want to have to explain to your 5 year old and you also don't want your five year old picking up some of the words being yelled by the customers. But they are great about packing the food to go so it stays warm and tasty! Just swing by and enjoy some Fuku at home! ",0,0,0,1,0

 After my third visit to Moira, I decided it was time for a review. First, the good. The location right in the heart of CenPho is perfect. The venue appropriately decorated. The vibe is eclectic. Now for the not so good. Each time I've dined there, dishes other than sushi were quite tasty, however their sushi really could use some work. When the name of your establishment contains the product you sell, you need to deliver on that one product above anything else. Moira fails to deliver in this critical area. To put into perspective, it is not that their sushi is bad, it is just mediocre and on par with Ra. So just in the same way that Ra is not necessarily bad, neither is Moira. But the expectation as a diner of a locally owned, unique restaurant, is that the experience would be better than a chain restaurant like Ra. The first two times I dined at Moira, the service was acceptable, yet the third time was not. This was in spite of notifying Moira ahead of time that we would consist of a large dinner party of 12+ people. The night we dined, I saw all of two servers for the entire restaurant. It was not until later that a third server came on duty, but by then it was too late. For a dinner party as large as ours was, we really needed a dedicated server. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was lucky enough to eat at the Cracked truck in the Food truck Oasis at bonnaroo. There are few things I like more in this world than a perfectly cooked egg and I know I'm gonna love a truck that makes this humble food their star ingredient. I did what I had to do and ordered the Goy Vey (bacon, hard salami, hash brown and a fried egg with sweet and spicy cream cheese on a ciabatta roll). This was glorious and for sure the best breakfast-for-dinner I've had in a long time. The sweet and spicy cream cheese made this not your regular run of the mill breakfast sandwich. The only downfall was the hash brown was fairly thin and hard to discern amongst all that fluffy bread. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I am singularly unimpressed with this place. I've lived in town for four years and for some reason I keep trying this place hoping one day it will change into a place that sells good food at reasonable prices. Isn't the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over expecting different results? Easter Brunch: $29 and pretty much completely tasteless. I don't mean the people were rude or the colors clashed, I mean the food had no flavor. Unless someone else buys this place and turns it into a restaurant I won't be back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Had a beer here while barhopping on the South Side. Neat little bicycle-themed bar with cool decor and decent beer list. Some awful slasher movie was on TV which actually transfixed me and my friends. Not too crowded, but seemed like a chill vibe. I'll definitely stop in if I'm in this area again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I really want to like this place. It's nice but just a touch overpriced for me, especially on the North Side. I was here for lunch on a Saturday but ended up with the brunch BLT and side of homefries. The sandwich was a little lopsided; all the B was on one side and kept falling off. I wish I had more L, and the T was one slice in the middle, so I wanted more of that, too. I really didn't enjoy the chunks of onion. I'm not talking about a thick-cut ring, or slivers of onion spread on top - there were big chunks of yellow onion just tossed on the bottom of the bun. I did enjoy the fried egg on top, though. I love fried eggs on anything! It added just the right amount of moisture to the bread (a hamburger bun, naturally). It was busy, so we sat at the bar. I love sitting at the bar. I just wish I had the quick service that everyone around me was afforded. I couldn't decide on a beer when I was first asked what I wanted and I waited until my meal arrived to get a beer - and I had to ask for it. I wasn't sitting at the far end, I was smack in the middle of the bar and two girls kept walking back and forth but never stopped to inquire if I was ready for a beer yet. I hate to harp on it, but if I'm paying $9 for a draft, I want $9 service. I'll be back to try more, but I'll try to come at a slower time and speak up sooner for that beer! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Had this review been written thirty years ago, the rating may have been better. Then again, it might have been impressive indeed, being the the interwebs themselves didn't really exist in any appreciable form. Nonetheless, Outback isn't what it once was - but are any of us? The good news is that you generally don't find the lines that used to congregate outside of the Outback. The bad news is that the inside hasn't changed much. Probably because most people have moved on from the shrimp on the barbie to the casual steakhouse concept (there are so many, I have to assume that is the problem). On the plus side, the Outback isn't bad - it just isn't what it was. The setting is nice enough, and the food is nice enough. Service is even solid. But there are so many better choices that it isn't really worth the effort on most nights. Now Outback seems to realize this that you might be able to score a gift card or other coupon, and in that case, it might be worthwhile. The bad part is that, as has been mentioned elsewhere, their portions are going down, while their competitors are increasing their portion sizes. that isn't good. Also the blooming onion has lost it's luster. It's oily and nasty. Maybe it always has been, but now we have moved on as well. The Outback needs to be out back. Near the dumpster. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Very poor quasi-oriental food. The service was approximately on par with the food though the wait staff were very nice--just not very together. My suspicions began when our order of two dishes came out of the kitchen in fewer than five minutes, and was only half right. We had a Honey and Walnut Shrimp that was overly sweet and that was not improved by the mushrooms mixed with the deep fried, over-breaded shrimp, though the walnuts were nice. And, because this was the dish that was freshly made, after we pointed out that we hadn't order the Mango Wango Shrimp, it was hot. We also had an Evil Princess chicken that suffered from the same problem that most dishes made with thin strips of chicken breast and all dishes not freshly made suffer from. I had to struggle to give this restaurant a second star and unless I hear from a trusted source that they ate here recently and that it was excellent, I won't be going back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The set up of this Wal-Mart is much different than the one I use around my house. I go to this location for work frequently, and the location in Buckeye has a set up that I am more use to. Not the stores fault, but I have a hard time trying to find a lot of things I am looking for. The only problem with that is that I can never seem to find any associates that are willing to help me find what I need. Any associate that I find seems to avoid me. Other than this, I really like Wal-Mart and their prices and I will continue to shop at this one and many others to save my money. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This was simply the most bizarre experience I've had in a restaurant in years. From the minute I walked in to find no one at the reception desk, always a good sign, to the fact that Renegade BY Mod has no idea what it wants to be. We were there on a Saturday night. The bar was full. a party was going on,with biker bar music and a crowd to match. This was seriously loud honky tonk music. We were there, however, to eat, thinking this was a restaurant known for food,not a bar crowd. The menu has descriptions that require descriptions-shrooms, soil{when""s the last time you saw soil on a menu?}and sand. The cutlery is in a container in the middle of the table-another attempt to be different. Now the food. The mushroom starter-shrooms - were actually the best thing we had. I had scallops which were far too salty. My friend had the very thin and incredibly tough short ribs-looking and tasting like no short ribs in memory. When we told the server he said many people had complained about them-perhaps a good time to re-think them or take them of the menu, yes? We ordered a chicken dish as a replacement for the short ribs. We waited twenty five minutes. During this period our server totally ignored us. I live in the neighborhood which could certainly benefit from an upscale quality restaurant but this isn't it. I can't imagine this restaurant surviving nor does it deserve to with management like this. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We have been going here for years with a few breaks in between because of bad service. We came with my mother-in-law for Sunday football and they were busy. They are never busy except for Spring training, so, good for them. Unfortunately, if there are more than a dozen people there, they cannot handle it. Got the last seat and the waitress came right up to us. After that, everything went downhill. We ordered 3 appetizers, she forgot to put the order for 2 of them in. She never came back around and we had to keep going and tracking her down. Asked the bartender for something too and he never bothered. Order came and she dropped one of the plates....it happens. Got the order for the other plate wrong and forgot sides for our nachos. Never got them. My mother-in-law got up to cancel the order because it was so frustrating at that point. The waitress called her rude. How dare her! She ended up coming over with drinks supposedly on the house to apologize and I told her to take back the nachos because they were cold and mushy by that point. She was pissed off. We left and somehow my mother-in-law ended up being charged for everything but 2 of the plates anyway. Not cool. Again, we have been going there for years and the owner and his son know us but never even say ""hi"". They are very grumpy there and we get the feeling like we are bothering them. This was definitely the last straw. They lost regular customers who brought other business to them because of the rudeness and lack of customer service. There are too many other sports bars around to deal with this. Because of the whole situation I ended up missing a great football game. Thanks a lot.... ",1,0,0,0,0

 This is formula fast food with a menu you look down at and pay too much for. Almost not worth writing a review, The Special Jerk Chicken is not even close to being a jerk. The mashed potatoes were beaten into a sticky gooey glue-like mess. The wife asked for Jerk-style ribs and got what the waiter said was a mango based jerk sauce. The Onion Rings were rock-hard tasteless hoops and the chicken wings were over-done and leather like. The high noise level made for difficult conversation. However the margarita was over-the-top and presented well. Go for the drinks and skip the food. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The ribs were touted to be fall off the bone, it was not. I had to fight a little bit with mine. The Barbeque sauce is homemade and on the savory vinegar side. If you're looking for an option that's sweet, they don't have that. The rotisserie chicken was great! Though the only sauce we had was their homemade one option. The food comes with 4 sides, corn bread, potato salad (mustard style), cole slaw (a little nod to the salad dressing style but not quite enough), baked beans, and corn bread. Loved the corn bread but wasn't a fan of the others. Huge servings all around just not as tasty as I'd like it. I'll give them another shot but it'll be to try their sandwiches and see if that's what makes them shine. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Kudos to Macayo's! New menu, clean flavors, clean presentation, solid service... The main man did the build your own thing with an enchilada and a tostada and I had a chicken chimi... All very tasty! Our only complaint was with the chicken on our nachos, it was canned chicken. Not sure why when they used very tender, moist, flavorful chicken in the chimi. The nachos were very good, they would have been great with the shredded chicken. They would have been outstanding if chicken asada had been used! But this is a HUGE turnaround for Macayo's and for the better! ",0,0,0,1,0

 So the last time I went it was an off night. After Sharing my experience on YELP I was contacted by Yard House, they apologized for the off night and wanted to make it up to us. They offered a gift card! The boyfriend and I went to dinner last night with family and friends. My family got the chicken nachos and they loved it!!! There was nothing on the plate left. Two other friend got the chicken wrap and those were soooo good, they came with 3 different sauces and the lettuce was nice green and crisp! We got the chips and salsa and the salsa was like a limony pico de gallo! LOVED IT! Next time I have a gathering I will probably just buy it from there. Saves me chopping and mixing time. Our waiter was great, he spoke loudly and clearly and was right there when we needed him! When we paid we had I believe the manager come up and ask what happened before and how today was! Thank you Yard house you are great! I voiced my concerns and you heard me! Great customer service!!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Everything on this menu is basically cooked in a very fresh, healthy way. I loved their original handmade salad dressing. A favorite of mine is the chicken salad and fruit plate. It comes with pita bread and was just lovely. Sunroom Cafe offers a variety of tea that is freshly brewed in your own teapot. I am a tea-drinker and you get a very satisfying two or three cups from the pot. Whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner Sunroom Cafe is named accordling as it iis a great, cozy place to dine.

 OK -- so the layout of this Chili's is pretty cool. It's 3 stories, and it has a unique 'cozy' feeling to each level. If you want to talk to somebody here, It's good if you're not here during lunch -- it can get a little loud. I'd recommend coming around 11:00 or after 1:00 to avoid the crowds. The food here is average. I recommend the burgers or the fajitas here. Contrary to what you might think, this place is a chain resturaunt, and it's NOT famous for its chilis. Wait staff is 'fair to midland'. They won't go out of their way to please you, but they don't stash you in a corner and forget about you, either. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Should be renamed ""Ghetto Hills"". When we first moved in, I was impressed, everything was quiet, abundant parking, etc. Well the new wave of tenants brought their disrespectful children, loud music, late parties and trash which they left on their doorsteps for days on end. And before anyone tries to play the ""race card"", I'm referring to neighbors of all ethnicities. My neighbor would beat his girlfriend, our other neighbor left trash outdoors for 3 days, outside facing the courtyard there are always a lot of youth throwing their footballs and have hit our patio door on more than one occasion and not usually the same kids. And I'm tired of being asked for money every time I go to check our mail! It's absurd. So think twice about moving here, if you can. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Sure I can write a review now or I can write a review later. Ah I'll just write an update later. Ok so its been open close to a month now and a good number of businesses aren't even open. All you see is nothing but ""coming soon"" signs with a lot of the businesses no where near of opening. Why even open up!? I don't even know. Anyways to keep track of what businesses are open and not here's their directory. Hopefully they keep it up to date http://downtownsummerlin.com/directory Along the NE part of this shopping center, YES a shopping center not an actual ""Downtown"", there's what they call the ""Dining Arroyo"" which has a nice water feature and spacious area to sit and relax from all the shopping and walking around. There's a few restaurants in that area like MTO Cafe, Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill, California Pizza, and Crave. Here's a couple of pics from the Dining Arroyo I'm facing west, notice how they fail to utilize the beautiful view of Red Rock Canyon and the mountains around. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/downtown-summerlin-las-vegas?select=a9d15FZhhi3tlpP4inH82g#a9d15FZhhi3tlpP4inH82g http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/downtown-summerlin-las-vegas?select=a9d15FZhhi3tlpP4inH82g#slSZgd8v5pEPy7WeCmvtRA All I can say is I hope Lazy Dog Restaurant and Bar, which is the NW most business not yet ready, considers having some outdoor patio with this view in the plans. As it goes for parking, you have options, there's a couple parking garages, parking along the streets right in front of various businesses, parking lots all around, and a couple vallet areas. There's also the option of walking from the casino which isn't a short walk as I hoped. If you've been to Green Valley Ranch or the District in Henderson it not that where you can just walk a few yards and you're there. It's a shopping center what else can I say about it. It has restaurants, clothing stores a movies theater. It's like they took some of the good features about the other shopping centers around the valley and tried to put it into one. Well there's a Nordstrom rack, Trader Joe's, Five Guys Burgers, Sur La Table, Regal, and Victoria's Secret so it's not a total bust. Of course I was very excited when I heard about the plans for Downtown Summerlin but as of right now I don't know, I guess I just have to wait until they're really truly open for my business, in a few months. It has potential. And as I think I mentioned in my tip. Enter and exit from the northern streets near Charleston, seemed like most people were using Sahara. ",0,1,0,0,0

 NOTE: this review and rating are for the dinner main dining room experience. For the life of me I don't understand why I keep getting really bad dinner service at this restaurant, which is unfortunate because the food and ambiance are both of decent quality. This past Friday I went to meet up with my friends at Piedmont Row for the golf tournament after party. I suppose all the establishments were aware of the special event and thus the crowd. After mingling and enjoying a cigar, we came over for a quick bite. The hostess was nice and prompt, but that's the end of the pleasant experience. I don't recall the waiter's name, likely because he never greeted us or introduced himself. Heck, I don't think he smiled once. I guess he was on his ""barely minimum effort"" mode. He barely paid attention. He barely took our order and brought our food. I had to wait until my soup was cold to get bread to soak it with. The kicker was when the only guy at our table of 4 said to him ""put the appetizer on my bill,"" he came back with the appetizer split among all of us, then looked at us like we caused this, and half heartedly offered to redo the check by his manager (as in he had no intention of redoing it). Our guy friend felt awful, and we were all pissed. Oh, the food was good, the soup is always delicious, and the mushroom ravioli could have more sauce. But the service was so bad we couldn't really enjoy the food. MANAGEMENT: if you are reading this, please be selective with who you hired. This is my 2nd time stuck with the most uncaring server (ironically the same booth, 2nd to the last row, 1st booth near window). If they don't want their job or tip, I am sure someone else would. To end on a better note, they have a great happy hour menu, which restarts after 9pm. And their bar service is normally consistently decent ",0,1,0,0,0

 We were on the mood for Greek and decided to try this place even the outside and the ambiance is soo outdated, always looks closed from outside. The food was ok, not great the Greek salad was not impressive it didn't even have onions the chicken was tasty, the meat kebab was dry and unseasoned but the worst part was the service, we where there at 7 and they close at 9:30 pm but as soon as we got our meals, we where not even half way into the meal they asked us its everything ok? Do you need anything? We said we are great thanks so they gave us the check???? What ???

 This is the most fantastically delicious Mexican food I have ever had. We started out with a fish ceviche followed by a shrimp ceviche. My daughter had a sea bass grilled and my son ordered a chille relleno. My wife ordered a carne asada fajita. Then we ordered a Molcajete Caliente for 2. This comes in a stone bowl with green sauce and cheese. It has shrimps, fish, carne asada and chicken. All hung on the hot stone bowl like a shrimp coctail!! Needless to say we all were eating each others food!! It hits your taste buds from every direction!! Yum!! We thought we would finish the meal with a flaan. How wrong we were! We just had to order another one. It was so delicious. The quantity is right up there with the quality. We had to pack up the left overs to go. There is no way I was going to let one ounce of this feast go waste. The service was exceptional. Our hostess/server was there like a genie. Water glasses were filled before they got empty, hot tortias appeared by magic, lime when requested materialised. Even when we awkwardly spilled a glass of water, it was soaked dry with a smile. I wish I could have this meal more often. I know that every time I come to Phoenix, they will have to deal with me!! :-) :-). ",0,0,0,0,1

 With only a 30 min lunch window, I have to make use of the time I have. Great Wall is fast and efficient. First time, I had to come in. I didn't have a menu or phone number. I made a quick lunch order. Great pricing and a big selection. There really wasn't a wait. Took me 10 minutes. Service is quick and while waiting, I noticed other folks calling in orders. Which I took to grab a menu to stash at work for next time. Place was packed while I was there. I ordered a sweet and sour pork, and chow mein lunch special. My chow mein was huge, way too much for lunch. Came with an eggroll and some fried rice. My coworker ate his whole box up. I asked him how was it, and he goes ""that hit the spot."" He's down to grab another box again next time. The chow mein was decently made. Not too heavy on the flavor which is great. I don't like how some places make it like Panda Express with tons of oil/grease. They knew how to package the togo boxes. Added utensils and sauces/spices. Parking may be a pain during rush hour. I browsed their menu and say mushu pork.. Not too many places make this item, so I'll def have to head back to grab me one. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Obsessed and can't wait to go back. Fried goat cheese bruschetta - amazing Sliders with blue cheese and onion strings- how can you go wrong?

 After all the years I've been going to Vegas I can't believe this is the first time I've ventured to the top of the stratosphere! I think I just assumed it was another gimmicky Vegas thing and didn't want to pay for it. But that is the best part of Level 107 lounge. We didn't have to pay to go up! At least not to the lounge. I think you can pay up to $18 a person to go to the top, but why if you can stop a little below, still get a great drink and good food with almost the same view! and the food is really good!!!! I will be dreaming of their pork belly appetizer until I return! The carpaccio was a little lacking but I'm really specific about how it's prepared, so I wouldn't hold that against them. We both had a sangria which was perfect because we were in more of a refreshing drink state of mind, and this fit the bill. So if you are like me and hate paying for touristy stuff, just go for the lounge. It's worth it!!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Very disappointed with this Salon. This was my first time here - I took my son. I've been to other Aveda Salon's and they've been great, so I really thought I was doing the right thing by having my husband take my son there for a much needed hair cut. While I appreciate that my 11 year old was very grumpy at having to have his somewhat long shaggy hair cut short, I didn't expect to have the Stylist cut as she thought fit. My son eventually picked a style out of a book, and the Stylist commenced the hair cut. In the end, my husband had to tell the Stylist to stop cutting and told her that what she'd done looked nothing like the cut in the book. Her reply was ""we'll this looks better'. I don't care what she thought - it was not what my son wanted. And in fact, the style looks awful on him. Not only is it way too short, the cut is choppy, chunky and uneven. It's so short that it can't be cut to fix it, it will just have to grow out. I believe that a Stylist should listen to their clients, no matter the age. My son is right at the age (almost 12) where looks are becoming very important, and he is now miserable that his hair looks 'stupid' (which in all honesty, it does). It can't be fixed, we now just have to sit and wait for it to grow. This should never have happened, if she'd just done what she'd been asked to do, instead of being 'scissor happy' and taking it upon her self to decided what my son needed. While they have agreed to give a refund, (the request was taken down by a grump, short, and rather rude receptionist), I would have rather paid the money and just got a good hair cut. Very disappointing from what should have been a great Salon. I wont be returning. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Just as promised! This place had great reviews and they were all correct. The hotel is a beautifully renovated space in the middle of a block of Old Montreal. The front desk staff are cool, friendly, and exceptionally helpful. I got the small room as I was traveling alone and it was perfect. Didn't want to leave the bed each day but was glad I did. This place is cozy. The location is very convenient to any of the sites in this part of town and it's a short walk to downtown, which still only took about fifteen minutes, even in the snow. The Notre Dame Basilica is just around the corner and it is breath taking, inside and out. Things get quiet in this part of town especially during Christmas week but there were still plenty of options for dining and drinks, and taxis are always seconds away. Pricing here is an outstanding value. Keep in mind that this is a non-smoking boutique hotel, so they may not have the same facilities as a large chain in a newer city. Thank. God.

 For me, this place is very satisfactory. It's not super great, but it gets the job done. Also, I liked the chips and salsa that they served starting off. It was a nice mix of torilla chips and sweet potato chips. The service overall was really friendly and prompt and I didn't have a whole lot of complaints on that end. My one complaint? The portions served. I got a chimichanga that looks like a fried burrito from chipotle with a side salad. It was a pretty good chimichanga, but i didn't feel that great after eating the body weight of a newborn with a side salad to boot. As you can tell, I'm not big on leaving anything on my plate. Lastly, the cherry on the frosting for me was the white chocolate pecan dessert thing they give you at the end. It's their version of the chocolate mints that they give you with the bill.

 Let me start by saying I do not like buffets- vats of food sitting under a heat lamp that is picked at by 100's of guests inst my idea of good food. However, this place changed my mind on buffets, there is a reason its the best buffet in town. The options seem to be endless, from Mexican to sushi to made to order pasta to crab legs and oyster shooters this place is unreal. The decor is fabulous, very trendy and you don't feel like your in a dimly lit smoky casino. There is a lot of natural lighting and views of the pool from inside. There wasn't anything I tried that was sub-par, everything was fantastic. Highly recommend checking this place out- it will change your mind on buffets. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Even though the name says ""Shabu Grill"", it's neither Shabu or Grill. The name can be a little misleading. For me the name ""Shabu"" refers to the Japanese style hotpot where as this restaurant serves authentic Chinese style hotpot. As of the date of this review, they no longer have any grilled items offered, at least that's what I observed. Anyway, if you are looking for Chinese style hotpot in Vegas, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO. Their hotpot is so awesome, I visit them at least twice a month. Their ingredients are so fresh and the restaurant is so clean. The service is awesome too. Their lunch price is $15.95 and I believe their dinner price is $19.95. I think the difference is that they have crab and lobster for dinner. They also offer ice cream at dinner and I highly recommend the green tea ice cream, it's very creaming and flavorful. Now I'm making myself hungry writing this review and all I have for lunch today is leftover lunch from yesterday.

 This is an update to my original post. I guess the management didn't like an honest review. There were also some other reviews on here that were a little more honest but they were deleted too.

First we were sat in the dining room (all but empty) that clearly didn't fit the concept. It was like they were trying to be country club-ish with the big chairs and all the wood but the service, food, and remainder of the atmosphere didn't fit. To top off the bad vibe they were setting up live music during our entire dinner. This means the lights guy was flashing the test lighting in my wifes face all night. Nothing like a blinding spotlight of varying shades to distract you from your dinner. I would have told the manger but didn't see one the entire evening. The hostess might have warned us about the live music, it's always nice to know when a band is going to warm up during your meal. To the owners: The chairs do not fit the tables. Short chairs make for an uncomfortable dining experience and make you feel like a little kid at the adults table. Service: Not entirely bad, a little slow and not very well coordinated but not terrible. One thing though, don't refer to a man and his wife as ladies and gentlemen. Neither I nor my wife are two people requiring a plural description. Also it should have been your recommendations not your recommends. You have a recommendation not a recommends!!! Other than that not bad. Wine service was normal and proper. Food: Are you Joking?????!!!! Apps: Shrimp Cocktail, Cheese and Charcuterie Entrees: Seared Ahi, New York Steak The shrimp was pedestrian at best. It wasn't bad but nothing I haven't seen a million times before. The cheese and charcuterie plate was laughable. First there was no actual charcuterie on the plate just some thick cut cured ham. Since no one told us what it was we'll assume it was prosciutto though it could have been serrano, either way it was to thick to enjoy. It was paired with some cheeses that, again, were not explained. There were only two when the server said there were supposed to be three types, all served with stale pre-grilled pita. Tuna wasn't even seared! It looked like there was too much liquid in the pan or the pan they used was not hot enough because the tuna was barely gray i.e. not seared golden brown in a hot pan. The tuna also looked like and tasted like it was frozen ahi and not fresh. The accompanying noodles were fine but pedestrian. The steak was Terrible!!! The New York steak was actually cooked a correct medium rare but it was under seasoned and incredibly dry and flavorless. It simply did not taste like anything at all. It came with over seasoned garlic fries that had 3 dipping sauces. One sauce was BBQ straight out of the bottle (sysco brand probably), one that tasted like ranch with buffalo sauce, and the other was just plain awful. By this time the band was well into testing the instruments 4-5 feet from our table and the lights guy was still unrelenting. We wanted to tell a manager how bad their place was but he wasn't around. Needless to say we left without dessert. The only thing this place has going for it is its decent wine list. I expect more from our local restaurants. There is NO REASON we can't have the same standards (at a minimum) that we have on the strip. If someone actually is serious about their restaurant and heeds this advice they will make plenty of money. For now all we have is a bunch of restaurants owned by business people with no passion for what they do and thus no soul. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This is a great place. I have a couple more small tattoos I'd like to get and I will definitely go back to this place. And if Nathan Z is still there - he's my guy. It was a great experience and I would highly recommend this place to anyone else looking for a tattoo. ",0,0,0,0,1

 After driving for hours to Vegas, pizza sounded pretty good. A friend really wanted to come here, so we decided to try this place out. Located inside of Moondoggie's Bar, this dimly-lit dive bar/restaurant was a little intimidating to walk in to. After being seated, service was definitely slow. Our orders weren't taken for quite some time. Also, food took a long time to be made, even though it wasn't very crowded. Only one other couple was eating in the dining area, and there were only a handful of people sitting at the bar. Our server spent the majority of her time helping the customers at the bar. Food: - Chicken, Mushroom, and Spinach Pie - This rectangular-shaped pizza had plenty of chicken, though there could have been more mushrooms and spinach. Ingredients weren't very well distributed on the corner pieces. The dough is pretty heavy, so it's quite filling. - Garlic Fries - Fresh garlic, parmesan cheese, and parsley. Pretty good and a decent size. ",0,0,1,0,0

 UPS needs to do review on this store and shut them down. They are ruining the UPS brand. The clerks who work here are very rude. I walked in there needing to ship something specifically ""overnight"" and was given options that were not overnight/next day. I was at the store at 1pm which is relatively early and before the cut off for next day. I was assured that the shipping service I purchased was going to be next day. Then throughout the night I was checking the tracking number and the product had not left. The next morning I call the store and they say that they still have the product. I was sending a passport that needed to be at my destination by 2 days after the first day I initially tried to send it (I chose next day ""overnight"" to get it there one day before luckily). After talking to the store over the phone and asking them why the package was not delivered, they told me I did not choose an ""overnight"" service. The one thing that I specifically told them was that ""this needs to be sent overnight so that it will arrive tomorrow"". Then they tried to charge me more money saying that I did not purchase an overnight product. Which first of all, I asked specifically only for their overnight options, why would you give me an option that is not overnight. Second, even if your incompetent clerks selected a service that is not overnight, why would it still be there. I am assuming if it's not overnight, it should still be on it's way for 2nd day and my 1 day cushion would save me. So I ask the clerk to tell the owner to give me a call. The owner did not give me a call back and told the clerk, ""I will not settle the difference for this, he will pay it or I will throw it away."" So the asshole wants to throw away the passport that I need to send because his staff sold me the incorrect service. I specifically stated to his clerks that the package ""needed to be there by tomorrow"" and said ""overnight"" several times. I paid a hefty premium as well for this service given that the product weights much less than 1 pound and I was there relatively early in the day. These guys are incompetent, distrustful and unreliable. If you need to ship something important, consider using another UPS store or Fedex. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The food is pretty good. We shared beef wontons, which were the best part, along with the chicken kabob. The kabob was massive so I would highly recommend sharing. The menu is a bit limited. The staff are friendly. The down side to this place is that this place looks filthy. From the floors to the walls, it makes you feel a bit uneasy. There is a strange entertainment center along one of the walls. You also have to take a 3 foot pipe or wooden post as a bathroom key. I don't think I'll dine in again but I'd give it a chance as take away. Although, they really need to clean up the place for me to want to go regularly. The food is good but they are losing points for the state of the place. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Funny name - great work. I got three estimates to paint my house. I didn't know much about Crash of Rhinos but Mike impressed me with his comments and his suggestions. When I told him we were unsure of the colors he volunteered to have Kim come out and take some pictures and then she could digitally paint our house with a few of the finalists. We took pictures and Kim was very helpful. The crash of rhinos (they really aren't big enough to be called rhinos) came out when they were supposed to and went to work. They covered everything that needed to be covered and moved everything that needed to be moved. My house is stucco and had a few cracks along with some nicks and dings. They fixed all of that as well as replacing a few trim boards that were damaged. The interior of my house is about 3,000 sq. ft. It's a single story with a 3 car garage. There's a lot of exterior that needed to be painted. They got the job done in 4 1/2 days with a crew that ranged in size from 3 to 5. Excellent job and I'm getting compliments from the neighbors. Highly recommended. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This is the second time we ate here and it was still bad. we had 2 salads delivered to our work and were so disappointed. The chicken wasn't blackened like the menu says and the flavor wasn't that great. The lettuce was wilted and the dressing was horrible. I called to let them know about the horrible food and the girl on the phone just defended they make everything fresh. I told her we were disappointed and would never order from them again. The total was also $19.35 - for 2 salads and a drink and the delivery driver didn't even bring a receipt of the break down, I feel ripped off. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We didn't choose this place, but it was a great choice. Got a smoky 1966 room at first. Asked for new room, got overlooked, then complained and got a great upgrade for free. Marble bathroom with huge shower, jacuzzi tub. 500 thread count sheets and view of the mountains and pools. GREAT room. Loved the whole hotel. I went in and out of almost every place on the strip and Cesar's offers an overall best for ambiance, quality, and service. Sure its expensive, but I felt like I was in luxury. Venetian is a wanna be Italian ambiance with cheesy shops and painted on tiles. Pools were amazing! Casino was high end and attentive. Good choice of restaurants (choose Sushi Roku) and gym was really nice. Hate that everything has a price tag--like $12 coffee in the rooms, but get the gym and you get fruit, water bottles and free coffee. Worth it. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This review is strictly regarding customer service and specifically about one representative at this specific location. I took my 2012 E350 to this location back in April, 2014 to replace the cracked windshield. I visited on a Saturday, and the two gentlemen there were very helpful. I had intentionally wanted to pay out of pocket, but the gentlemen suggested that I file a claim and helped me with the claim on site. They were professional and courtesy and genuinely were happy to be there to do their job. I returned today due to another crack that requires another replacement. I am pretty sure it was not the integrity of the windshield since the windshield had to be special ordered from the dealer. I arrived well before my appointment, and the office was not busy at all. Teresa was behind the front desk, and she looked confused as I explained to her that I am here for my appointment. She found my paperwork and continued to look confused. I explained to her that I am here for an inspection to see rather the crack qualifies for a warranty-repair or a replacement. She reluctantly got up from her seat and returned with another gentleman. The gentleman was very helpful and explained to me that a replacement is required. I went back inside and explained to Teresa what the gentleman told me and asked if she could file a claim for me since my insurance information was previously given during my visit in April. She was rude with her response and did not seem like she wanted to help me file a claim at all. She gave me several dirty looks before I politely asked again if she would call and file a claim while I am there with her. She finally called and was placed on hold. In the meantime, I asked if she would need to order the windshield since it was special ordered from the dealer last time. (I thought it was a very legitimate question to ask as I would schedule my appointment with Safelite accordingly.) She gave me yet another dirty look and said that she would have to check and continued to look displeased by simply sitting there. By this time, I realized I could be paying the Mercedes dealer the same deductible and receive MUCH BETTER customer service than I am getting with Teresa. I am sorry, Safelite, I would have happily returned as a happy patron, but due to your ONE representative who cannot do what she is hired to do, I will not recommend this business. ",1,0,0,0,0

 given the close proximity to my house, i wish i could give this place a better review. first of all, the entire menu is confusing... they don't serve many of the traditional thai dishes that you'd find in most thai restaurants. i noticed a mix of chinese and other asian dishes, not thai. the tom yum soup is the worst i've ever eaten... way too sweet. they have hot and sour on the menu... again, i thought it was a thai restaurant, not chinese. bummer.

 If you are a fan of breakfast food, you will be a fan of Deluca's Restaurant. That is really all that needs to be said about this iconic Pittsburgh breakfast spot. If you are reading this however, I am sure you would probably like a little bit more information on what is actually happening here. Located in the Strip District, and featured on Man v. Food, Deluca's Restaurant is the top choice for those looking for some grub to start their day off. During our visit, we arrived later in the morning and were greeted with a line that went out of the building and extended onto the cold sidewalk outside. However, the line moved very fast, and the employees did everything they could to get people in and out in the most productive way possible. After being seated, and looking over the menu, I decided to get the Steel City breakfast, which is basically a little bit of everything on the menu. In fact, I felt a little glutenous when they brought out my three plates of food, but hey, I needed to get my foodie on. From the eggs, to the french toast, everything I ate was absolutely delicious. Greasy, and delicious. It was one of those meals that is just so delicious, that you don't even take the time to make conversation with your fellow diners because you are too busy stuffing your face. I wish that Deluca's was here in Cincinnati. I would go to this wonderful restaurant every morning if I could. If you live in Pittsburgh, don't take this gift for granted. To do so, would be a great dishonor. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I decided to give this restaurant a try after receiving a gift certificate as part of a cooking class and was less than impressed with the quality of both the food and service. To be fair: My partner and I are from a coastal region accustomed to high quality seafood and we ordered the two specials, ahi tuna and crab stuffed shrimp, in disregard of the basic seafood restaurant wisdom indicating that specials are often attempts to sell fish about to spoil and one should avoid them at all costs. These dishes, while not on the verge of spoiling, were nothing special despite the upscale price tag and left us unenthusiastic about Mr. Wholey's establishment. The tuna was prepared ""asian style"" which meant slightly over cooked and bathed in some sort of bitter sauce reminiscent of cheap teriyaki. This was served with absolutely fantastic wasabi mashed potatoes and expertly prepared bok choy. It was hard to overlook the fact that the chef overdressed a cut of fish that demands simplicity and in the process, destroyed the delicate flavor I was attempting to purchase. My partner's dish was an improvement in that shrimp will take a chef's liberties a little kinder and featured another rendition of the great mashed potatoes I found on my plate. The crab failed to transform the shrimp, as the name indicated it would, and could have been otherwise better employed. We declined desert based on the weakness of our entrees but must say that the mashed potatoes were memorable. The service was moderate to poor. I worked as a waiter for a couple years and consider myself sympathetic to the occupation and the skill it entails. Our server seated us next to one of the glass garage doors lining the restaurant face. This would have been fantastic had this door been open, allowing the pleasant summer evening to breeze over our table. The door was not open and thus subjected us to a greenhouse affected micro-climate in which both of us began to sweat in the direct sun despite the pleasant temperature outside. I know from experience that patrons are evenly distributed by a host/hostess to the sections assigned to each server and that our seating was not the server's fault. Yet why the server would not open the doors and take advantage of the day is either the result of a lack of skill and/or intuition or poor management. Service 101: comfort of the patron is paramount. Our server seemed to ignore this environmental negative (and the potential to turn it into a positive) despite having to shield her eyes from the sun when addressing us. She chastised our use of the gift certificate after our meal and indicated that she would use it as a favor to us but typically this would not be okay. To clarify: Luke Wholey was due as a guest instructor at a cooking class we paid for and did not show up, sending the gift certificates as a reparation. It was in no way acceptable for her to question a valid use of Mr. Wholey's self-serving consolation. I can only assume her hesitation to use the certificates was out of concern for her tip (perhaps she thought we would think the amount due after the certificate was our total in a tip calculation). Since she must have been capable of reading the clearly stated premise indicated on the certificate itself I am left to imagine that she is used to people tipping poorly and wished to avoid continuing this trend with us. My final note concerns the bar menu. Myriad are the restaurants at which I can overlook lapses in cuisine or service so long as the bar is strong. Wholey's makes an attempt at a draft beer list with a few solid craft brews in among the tasteless masses and has several attractive bottled offerings. The cocktail menu features anticipated twists on standards but fails to indicate the presence of a genuine mixologist. The cucumber collins thoroughly proved that suspicion. This dry take on a tom collins featured fresh cucumber and utilized hendrick's, one of the finer spirits of this ilk. How one manages to f*#k up a cocktail with such a fine gin is beyond the scope of my understanding. A warm lemon soda water with cucumber is not an acceptable refreshment. I will not return to Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille. Pittsburgh may be too far from the sea (much less Alaska) to foster a great seafood restaurant or perhaps I just went to the wrong place. However, Wholey's failures went well beyond the plate and indicate that a systematic or managerial fault may be in play: Poor service, poor bar-tending, and poor environment compound as issues that are unlikely to be resolved any time soon.

 I wished I have found this place earlier! Being a Friday my friend and I decided to go to Cupcakes-A-Go-Go Cafe to try out some of their stuff after hearing some nice comments from another friend. We were not disappointed! So far I have tried their macarons (vanilla, chocolate, mango, raspberry and salted bourbon caramel) and cupcakes (chocolate espresso truffle, red velvet with pomegranate, oreo, french vanilla strawberry and tiramisu). I really like the vanilla macarons (you can taste the vanilla beans in them!) and their mango macarons (the mango is so rich, which kept me wondering if there were real mangoes in the fillings). Their cupcakes are super good and very different from what I'd had so far. The frosting blends in with the cupcakes that it feels so natural to have the frosting with the cake. I have never finished the entire frosting on my cupcakes prior to this, either because they are too sweet or too much. So this is really awesome for me. Their cupcakes are not the cheapest, you can get cheaper ones downtown Madison. But I will be back again for more of my favorites, and try a couple of others that I didn't get to today, such as their black forest cupcakes!! Btw, their cupcakes are buy 12 get 1 free, you don't have to get all 12 at one go, it's cumulative, either use their mobile app, or a punch card to keep records. And there are special offers for checking in as well! This is a Friday afternoon well-spent =) ",0,0,0,0,1

 While I still like the almond torte, I just can't justify my original rating when the overall selections are just subpar. After trying a larger selection of their baked goods, especially the mini cake cups, I realized they all look delicious but when you bite into them, they're really dry and full of generic cake frosting. If you're still tempted to get one, go with the tiramisu since it has the redeeming factor of having a strong coffee flavor. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm pretty surprised that there are so many positive reviews. I suspect some of the reviewers work here or are friends of servers. Regardless, the most I can give this place is 2 stars. They have a great layout, nice decor, and a wide selection of beers on tap (love that my favorite cider is on tap-that never happens!). HOWEVER, after saying all that, the food is just okay. It isn't bad, but it certainly isn't unique or memorable. The staff does not know the menu at all and none of them have had a menu tasting yet, so when you ask for feedback, they cannot tell you anything about the food. The food choices are pretty limited as well. One other thing that was odd. Today when I visited, they had an employee dressed up like a gorilla on the street corner, trying to bring in customers (their 'mascot' is a monkey). So that's weird (what are they, a cash for gold place?), but the weirdness graduated to obnoxious when the guy came into the restaraunt and intentionally started scaring customers. He kept coming up behind patrons and catching them off guard. Customers were good sports, but I would have been pissed if that had happened to me! I felt like I was in the movie 'Trading Places.' Odd marketing choice for such an upscale neighborhood. Sadly, I predict this place won't survive the slow death of summer. If you just come here for a good beer and to watch the game, you won't be disappointed. The key is to not have high expectations. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I went on Monday night, it was fairly busy, but I was by myself so the hostess suggested sitting at the bar so I did. First off the bartender (I forget his name, young cute guy) was REALLY great. Super nice, and just sitting there watching him make drink after drink with ease, and answering everyones questions about the large beer selection. I was really impressed with the service. Especially considering how busy this place is and how new it is. They really have their act together. I ordered the Farm Burger and the truffle fries. The burger I have to say was just ok. I didn't like the meat, it was a little dry and had sort of a strange taste (maybe the fancy wood it's grilled on?), I ordered it medium. Like I wish it was fattier or something... Then considering it had duck bacon and a fried egg and aioli on it all i could taste was the meat. I think I just prefer not grilled burgers to be honest. Or it could just be what I had... But those fries were to die for!! Oh man I swear they must of shaved a whole block of cheese in them, and the truffle aioli was delicious. I can't recommend those highly enough. I'll definitely go back just to have those. I would like to try more burgers. I know burgers are finicky, it may be better next time! I didn't think the price was terrible. For those two things it was about $30 with tax and tip. You would share the fries if you had another person with you. Overall, check it out, I think you need to form your own opinion on this place.

 This is one of my favorite places to get sushi in town. I have been going here for years and love that there is no ""all you can eat"" option - just a diverse menu full of high-quality fish. The chefs are trained well and present the dishes in a nice fashion. I love that they give you free edamame and cucumber salad when you sit at the bar. My favorite rolls are the Tempura Roll and Japanese Lasagna. I ordered the Boom Boom Nipple Special last night and it was pretty good, however I was not really into the fish mix tempura that went along with that. Other than that, I always have a superb experience dining here. Highly recommend! ",0,0,0,0,1

Can't believe nobody has posted a picture or written anything about it thus far (or at least the reviews I read didn't mention it). Yes, it's a pretty generic dish to order. You're probably asking, ""How tasty could it be??"" I was very surprised by not only the speedy service but also how thoroughly cooked/seasoned the chicken was, pasta were perfect in length and the entire dish not overwhelmed by the Alfredo sauce. I could go on an on, i guess just look at the picture I post and imagine it to be 3 times as delicious as it looks?? p.s. portions are huuuge ",0,0,0,1,0

 I'll second the thought that the decor isn't much, because it isn't. But I'm not sure about the idea that they don't speak much English. While this isn't a Taco Bell, and definitely is place more off-the-beaten path than your average Americanized Mexican eatery, they speak better English than a lot of places you might find. Interesting because of their locale - in this section of Central, you're just as likely (if not more so) to find a place that doesn't speak any English at all - for instance, the Casa de las Enchiladas right down the block. In any case, the food is decent, but I didn't find it all that great. If you're at the Central Avenue location, I'd go the extra half a block and go to Casa de las Enchiladas - though you might want to brush up on your Spanish first. ",0,0,1,0,0

 If you go hoping to see and hear sir Elton John do outrageous costume changes from yesteryear besides his wonderful singing...don't go. Sir Elton does wonderful songs but that's it. He is more mature now, no high heeled shoes, think they are tennis shoes and no costumes.. We went on 7 oct. The sound was bad. Too much background music over his wonderful voice so the lyrics were drowned out. To get great seats had to pay a broker almost $600 for 25 row for this performance which is ALOT for us. Good performance but not the hoopla we hoped for especially not being able to hear sir Eltons voice clear.

 Our family has gone to Dr. Hackenyos for years. All of us think the world of his superb care. He has accurately guided us through rare conditions, he refers when he feels we need a specialist. He explains things in understandable terms. He LISTENS and asks questions to refine his care. I can say without hesitation he is absolutely the best doctor we ever have gone to! We found him in the phone book and feel we won the lottery! I am glad he doesn't give medications to those who don't consult him when they expire. To me each of us are responsible for his own care. I too, am caring for a mother 90 and I have several medical issues. He has helped us through dealing with my 93 year old father-in-law as he was in hospice. My adult son suffers from a debilitating permanent side effect because of another doctor's careless prescribing. We are glad he is diligent and careful. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place looked very promising from the menu and the decor. I typically enjoy any Fox restaurant, however, this restaurant is a gimmick. I ordered the free range half chicken. I really enjoy this dish at most restaurants, but I was disappointed. The chicken seemed to be low quality, and was very fatty. The iced tea was good though. If you are vegan or have a food allergy, this restaurant will be great for you. However, otherwise, you are paying for food that may have a gluten-free, vegetarian, or vegan label that lacks flavor. If you are looking for this option, then try it, but otherwise, I would find a restaurant that offers a smaller selection of these dishes at a lower price. Just mediocre. And way overpriced.

 Wow! East Ohio Street can be a weird place with an eclectic array of individuals. Including a Pawn shop, drunks, criminals, seedy bars, and all the riff raff . Troublesome location for a Bistro. To add to the weirdness, all of their food is pre- made and displayed and served and nuked when you order. Like gourmet cafeteria food on the fly... if you can picture that. They use a lot of gravy on everything assuming to hide the taste. On a few occasions, I heard what would appear to be the owner yelling at the workers it made me feel uncomfortable so I just walked out. No one should be subjected to that kind of scrutiny. That wasn't the first time I heard dissention behind the counter either. Because of the owner's dramatic behavior they have a rather dysfunctional crew. They moan when you walk in. Customer service is eliminated by the overall vibe. In full, if you like overpriced bland cafeteria style food, & an unhappy lot serving it to you... I'd say this is Pittsburgh's best bet.

 i have been coming here for a conference for 7 years. The rooms are terrific, the staff are amazing, it has a great restaurant - the Terrace room and a Starbucks. The hotel has played host to presidential hopefuls like John F Kennedy - the staff have better details and are glad to share their stories. Many of the people that work here have been here forever and they can tell the stories first hand. I would have given it a 5 but they could not get my heat going the last time i was there - there climate control systems are a little antiquated so i froze my butt off - less than 55 in the room. If you like classic older - full of character hotels this is the place to be. Style and class are everywhere. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Our second time here was good, not great, not special. We won't go back for a full meal, just late night snack. Love the decor and the upscale modern feel. It's a great place for a date. We like to walk through the W Hotel entrance to enjoy the lounge scene. Another plus is going to the W pool deck to hang out and schmooze post sake The food was expensive and good. To drop a couple of big bills and not be wowed is criminal. We had some winner dishes and the only real loser was some kind of steak skewer. Our server kept pointing us to the specials. We like to sit at the bar and watch the artistry of the food being prepared. We tried a number of times to encourage the chef to be creative with a particular item ie, sea eel to no avail. It was right off the ""special"" menu and very tasty but not an eye roller. Guess these specials are tried and true throughout the entire chain of sushi restaurants this group owns. Perhaps therein lies the problem, the CHAIN effect... cookie cutter sushi; good and satisfying, but not memorable. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The Kids Love This Place I like Peter Piper Pizza because my nephew has so much fun. But, overall the food is average at best and the service leaves something to be desired. Our large pizza took over 35 minutes, and when I commented on the wait to our server, she replied ""...and we're not even busy"" The games all the same style for the most part. However, my nephew walked away with more then 1600 tickets, and he was thrilled. The pizza is average but we will return simply because $20 buys a filling meal and an additional $20 buys my nephew an hour of fun. There are a lot better pizza places (like Grimaldi's ) but I really don't go to Peter Piper for great pizza. We go to Peter Piper Pizza for games and fun. When I want a great pizza I head over to Grimaldi's. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm astounded at the fuss is around this place. Outside of the view and that it has that hipster smell, what's the attraction? Limited beer selection. I could accept that if the food were good. But it's not. Went for the ""famous"" Friday fish fry. Clearly nothing is made from scratch. The coleslaw was average. The roll was something out of the freezer. The ""roasted"" potatoes were still crunchy. And the fish was on the order of Mrs Paul's. Seriously, I don't expect a lot from a $13 fish meal, but I do expect better than what I was served. The cafeteria at work serves better fish for half the price. The service was good and the people were friendly, but at some point the food needs to carry it's weight. This is a restaurant after all.

 I ate breakfast there on weekday morning. Normally I wouldn't goto Grand Lux with so many other options in Vegas but I wanted to try something new and the situation at the time didn't allow for anywhere else. Service was slow even though the restaurant wasn't that busy. Although the restaurant is open 24 hrs, they aren't very flexible about fulfilling requests. Tried to order a house salad but they said they couldn't meet the request. Not a big deal, but it was late in the morning you would think they could throw some lettuce in a bowl especially for a restaurant that's open 24 hrs. Like I said, not a big deal since they aren't a diner. Ordered the corned beef hash and eggs. Portions are huge just like the Cheesecake Factory. It was good, nothing outstanding however. Prices aren't outrageous, besides the typical Strip markup. All in all an OK experience. I wouldn't eat here again unless it's 4AM but that's only because there are so many other dining options in Vegas. ",0,0,1,0,0

 In every possible way, Ilios Noche was fantastic - I don't use this word often, but it's the first word that comes to mind when I think back to my experience here. Everything that makes up what a restaurant is - the food, service, ambiance - was top-notch. FOOD: I started with the Country Greek salad and my husband had the Mesclun salad. I didn't think it was possible to have salad THIS good. The Mesclun salad, especially, was a beautiful explosion of harmonious flavors. Yes, from a salad! For my entree, I had the Crazy Lasagna. Delicious, and never had anything like it before. SERVICE: The sommelier was our server. I unfortunately do not recall his name, but he was wonderful. Very attentive. When we asked for suggestions on wines to pair with our dessert, he brought out 3 glasses, thoroughly described each of them, and left them for us to enjoy. While having dessert, the general manager came by to say hello and thanks for dining with us. As a former NYC resident, I've tried a good amount of noteworthy restaurants. Ilios Noche surpassed many of the ones in NYC. This is the restaurant that has changed the way I now give 5-star ratings. Can't wait to return to try other items on the menu! ",0,0,0,0,1

 If you are a fan a Coke. You will love this large store full of Coke Merchandise. You can also take your photo with the Coke Polar Bear. They also have a soda shop so if you are wanting a Coke Float or any coke items, here is the place to give yourself a treat. However, I highly recommend doing the Around the World Taste. For $7, you get 16 cups of drinks around the world. Definitely 4-5 people can share this. It's interesting to taste all the different flavors, but there is one that will make you gag!

 Every time I go to Vegas, I swing by this Fat Tuesday for frozen daiquiris, typically a yard or more and then go about wandering the strip and have fun! I typically visit Vegas during the summer so it's perfect to stay cool and you have your fun. This time however, I went during the winter and it was COLD, but I still had LOTS of fun drinking it! The guy working there told us that the Category 5 Hurricane and the 190 Octane are the two strongest drinks. I had both in two days and I really recommend the 190 Octane! I'm more partial to the orange flavor, but also the Category 5 Hurricane leaves an aftertaste that I didn't care for. It's fine if you drink a small glass, but when you drink a yard or more of it, it gets kind of old. Other flavors I've had in the past are Strawberry and Margarita, both simple and delicious! So I would say avoid the Category 5 Hurricane and you're fine. But you can also sample any of the flavors before buying in case you don't trust me and my drunken self! I also highly recommend getting the extra shot for only a dollar. It's a cheap and quick way to get buzzed and to have fun. There are also jello shots for only a buck with whipped cream if you want as well as some beers so it takes care of everyone. But seriously, it's a great place to get cheap drinks and to have fun while you're in Vegas! Oh! And to reveal a moment of buzzed stupidity, this particular location has a light and music show that takes place every half hour to hour depending on the day (I think half hour on weekends and hourly on weekdays). So we had the opportunity to sit around and drink, be merry and had 2 rounds of jello shots in the mall. I chugged my own yard of 190 Octane and got SO buzzed! I was sprawled out on the chair looking up at the light show going on the ceiling, singing Spider-Pig (Simpsons Movie reference) as they were playing the theme song to the Simpsons! Oh, they also offer you a discount for refills with your drinks so hold on to your cup. I got so buzzed and into the music and light show that I temporarily lost my empty cup. It simply rolled over to the FCUK clothing store, but I was too buzzed to find it for 10 minutes or so. I fortunately found it and proceeded to get a refill! YUM! Seriously, this place is great for cheap and STRONG drinks and you have the mall at your disposal to shop and gamble and then come back for more! Have lots of fun. I've actually visited ALL of the Fat Tuesdays on the strip (yes, I'm a lush) and this is MY favorite location of all of them! Have fun here because I ALWAYS do!!! Enjoy, I know you will! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Got back in town yesterday just in time for the Steelers afternoon game to start. The North Shore location is 2 blocks from my office, and I had been here only once before, and had friendly service and a good sandwich one a weeknight there. So I was interested in trying it out for a game. However, we were disappointed. Inexplicably the place was closed. Closed on Steelers Sunday! They even had a flyer advertising the drink specials that you couldn't take advantage of because they were closed for game day! Now, I don't know what sort of brainiac business management theory they are working off out there, but if you have booze and Steelers you have 2 out of the 1 thing you need to make money in Pittsburgh on a Sunday. Unbelievable. The search for an adult place to watch steelers games continues.... ",1,0,0,0,0

 For what it is, a fast food Americanized Oriental restaurant, it's not overly bad, as long as you don't order shrimp. Service: I've never had a problem here. While not always the most outgoing service, they are friendly. My order is always ready in a decent amount of time. I've never dined in, so I won't comment on atmosphere. Their menu and nutritional info is easily accessed on line. For the most part, I've had OK experiences with the food selections. I don't expect spectacular food from this place, it is, after all, 'Fast Food' from a restaurant chain. It's nothing really special. However, today I had an experience that sort of turned my stomach a bit. I ordered a Shrimp and Veggie Stir fry to go. When I got back to work and went to dig in, I was a little disgusted to find that the shrimp were not deveined prior to cooking. For those of you who don't know what that means: The Shrimp's digestive track (seen as a dark brown 'vein' along the spine of the shrimp) wasn't removed, which means that the digestive track and it's contents were left in place. Yes, I know it's not horrible to eat it, but if you know what it is, it can turn your stomach. I assumed that a restaurant such as this would devein shrimp prior to cooking. I pulled all the shrimp and deveined them myself, but I'd already lost my appetite. I did put the shrimp aside and ate some of the brown rice and veggies, but with my stomach already feeling a bit nauseous, that didn't go well. So now I'm left with an $8 meal sitting on my desk (soon to hit the garbage) with only about 1/8th of it consumed and having to find an alternative for lunch. Lesson learned, if I'm craving a good stir fry with shrimp, shell out the extra cash for PF Changs. **** I thought eventually I'd go back, but I haven't been since then. We had some of their food catered in for work, it was overcooked, rubbery, and chewy. yeah, next time I'll get my own lunch. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Decent sushi at an extremely good price. It's a very small shop so we took the rolls to go. For ~$38 we were able to get 5 rolls and 2 udons for dinner. The service was kind of slow at the time but I went with 5 other people who had separate orders. It probably isn't the best sushi in town but you can definitely satisfy a sushi craving given the low price and large rolls. We plan on going again. ",0,0,0,1,0

 i really did not enjoy my short time in this awful restaurant. The only reason i came here is because a friend of mine keeps kosher and we couldnt really find anywhere else to eat, so we came here. The service was crap. The waiter acted like a freaking diva, and the food was terrible. We were a party of 5 people, so we pushed 2 tables together. The retard waiter came up to our group and said we cant push tables together, so 5 people were stuffed on a table that was meant for 2 people ( un-freaking-believable). There were no prices on the menu nor on the large overhead lighted up menu next to the register, so we ordered an XL pizza assuming it would be $13-17ish. We then helped ourselves to some snapples which we later found out were $3.50...!!! wtf! who charges $3.50 for a little bottles of snapple?! After we finish eating our nasty pizza ( even microwave pizza is better then their pizza) on our tiny table with a party of 5 we ask for the bill. The waiter comes to our table, throws the bill on the table as if hes doing us a favor and walks away... The bill came out to $45!!!! FOR ONE XL PIZZA?!!!!!! ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?! IM NOT AT SOME FANCY RESTAURANT! This restaurant is seriously this little ugly 550 square foot room with a tiny kitchen in an ugly area off the strip. Who on earth do you think you are charging us $45 for a pizza. Freaking retards. We left $1 for tip. I even considered that too much. You give us jews a bad name, shame on you idiots. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Food was good but service was less than stellar. We came to the counter and clerk didn't acknowledge us, he just stood there. We ordered to eat in. About 10 minutes went by and no food. We looked up at the counter and the food had come out and was sitting up there- no attempt to call out that it was ready or, heaven forbid since we were the only table in the place, they would bring it out to us. Another order came up and there was one other person in the place..they yelled out the order was ready this time. Woman was out of it and didn't go pick up the food. They called it out 2 more times..she was 5 feet away and the only person..they couldn't walk it out to her? Not impressed. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Bad Experience!!! I loved the selection of cars they had. I went there yesterday to test drive a lexus is250 used. I fell in love with the car and would of bought it right then and there. But the sales associate Easton McIntosh was terrible!!! If you ever go there please see another sales associate! I have never felt that belittled ever by someone.If your buying a car you should never feel like that. One, its already a stressful situation buying a car. Second, to have the sales associate talk you down and belittle you is so unprofessional. At one point he said to me and my dad; ""Why are you even here if you cant afford the car."" HOW RUDE!!!! Tells you a lot about the company if they have people like that working for them. They were non negotiable. This is my first car and I had 50% cash down payment and he still wouldn't work with me. Ill find another car elsewhere and where they appreciate my business. To bad because I loved the car.

 this is for the sunday jazz brunch only 65$ is wayy too expensive for the quality this place is churning out!! oysters that tasted like they were spoiled and that both my friend and i had to spit out. we told our waiter and nothing was done. we were just honestly concerned about the food safety issues. i thought rio buffet oysters were kind of suspicious but dang these oysters take the cake for worst i have ever had in las vegas. the buffet part was dismal at best. when your best offering are the smoked meats you got some problems. boring cajun shrimp, dried out hunks of meat for the carving station, gumbo with mushy crawfish and seafood cooked to death, and so little options you cant help but feel cheated when the bill comes. dessert had a few stars like their chocolate mousse cake, macaron. but also slim pickings. i was able to carry one of each item on one plate. the only reason i give the brunch 2 instead of 1 is cause their made to order menu items are pretty good. and its also all you can eat. so if you do go honestly just get one of each from the menu. shrimp and grits are really good. but you can get this on their normal lunch menu and its not gonna cost you 65$. so in the end if youre going to charge me 65$ for really mediocre if not below mediocre food i'm gonna be unhappy about it. 25$ is reasonable for this brunch but i understand that i am at the Wynn and theres a nice view so 35$ but any higher, i'd say youre pushing it. skip jazz brunch it aint worth your time, or money ",0,1,0,0,0

 Incredible. Astoundingly good. Amazing in every way. I really wanted to dislike this place, because how can any restaurant in CLT be worth a two hour wait? But it is...it really is. We went on a Wednesday (after refusing to wait 2 hours on a Saturday), and it was 1/2 price bottle of wine night. Oh my. Good wines, at half price, Im in. For dinner, I had the Boursin Burger, which was so good I literally could not eat it fast enough. Best burger ever. Really. My husband had sushi, and he is a sushi novice, so he cant compare it to much, but he really liked it. We skipped dessert (I drank my dessert, did I mention bottles were half price) but desserts going to other tables looked good. If your curious about this place, try it, you wont be disappointed. The food is worth whatever wait you encounter. Yea...the hostess was kinda bitchy and the crowd was your standard Southpark crew, but I rate places based on food. If you want the best damn food in CLT, head to Cowfish. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We had high hopes for Three Amigos. Went on a Friday night and and after waiting a long time to be seated we were finally seated. When asked if they had draft beer, the hostess clearly had no idea what draft beer meant and said she would get back to us yet she never came back. We sat there for a very long time watching waitresses go by ignoring us. We had to flag down a waitress to get our drinks. My husband wanted to just leave at that point but I wanted to at least try the food and drinks. The waitress we flagged down said she didnt know who was supposed to have our table but she would take our orders. The waitress was very nice but had no idea what the different draft beers were. Being from a local brewery I wanted to at least know which ones were lighter in color so I could choose accordingly but she couldnt even tell us that. The food took a very long time to come out and it wasnt even that great. We sadly will not be going back to this restaurant. Protip: Make sure your waitresses know about your local beers you are serving but if you cant educate them at least have descriptions on a menu. The waitress told us she had no idea what they were like because she ""didnt drink beer"" and just showed us the names of the beers she had scribbled down on a piece paper. ",0,1,0,0,0

 After checking out the Cosmo and loving every inch of the hotel, I was uber excited to see what their nightclub had in store for us. From what I've read on Twitter, it seems like a house kinda of club w/ house DJs (which isn't normally my thing) so, when I heard DJ Vice was gonna kick off it's ""Industrt night"" (for locals) on Mondays, I WAS ALL ABOUT IT. I wasn't expecting too much since the last time I had high expectations for a club (HAZE @ Aria), I was disappointed. But, Marquee was a pleasure. Very reminiscent of Tao. Which is to be expected since it's run by Tao Group. And like Tao, it's super spacious and dark. And from what my guy friends said: THERE ARE GIRLS EVERYWHERE!!! THE GUY TO GIRL RATIO IS 3 TO 1. So guys, if that's what you're looking for (DUH! Stupid question. It's Vegas). Then, here ya goooo. The cool thing is there are more than 1 room in the club that plays different music from the main room, since there are 3 floors. (From what I remember!!?!??! Forgive me -- it was all a blurrr). One room is the Library room with pool tables, a sit down area, and waitresses dresses as school girls (DUH.) There's the main room with a big dance floor and ability to see everyone on the dancefloor with the way they did the floorplan. My absolute favorite part of Marquee was the pool area/top floor. SO PRETTY w/ all the cabanas and palm trees! Reminds me of Drais LA's pool deck. I cannot wait to see what the Day Club will bring us in the summer.

 The only reason I booked a room there was for a convention at Planet Hollywood. I was disappointed in the ""resort"". First the parking is truly a 15 minute walk. and if you rie a motorcycle it is not like you can use valet parking, and you will walk quite a distance with your bags. Before I booked a room there I specifically asked about parking for my bike and was told there will be plenty of parking but when I got there I had to maneuver an 800 lb motorcycle thru bicycles and scooters that were parked every which way. After my hike to the reservation desk the cashier informed me I cold not opt out to pay cash at the end of my stay. my CC would have the amount placed on ""hold"" and in essence holds the amount of money basically at ransome. I have been at other hotels that did not have to do that and were glad to have my CC info but did not hold funds on my CC. We found our way to the elevators and found Brittney Spears plastered everywhere! The decor felt dated and there was not the clean feeling one would expect. When I opened the door the room reeked of cigarette smoke! Then I found an ashtray so I called the front desk. Turns out that the cashiers just put us in a smoking room with gout ever asking if we smoke! And he figured we would want to stay in the room for four days....didn't ask us if we smoked? Well I guess that was MY fault since I had on a motorcycle jacket he profiled all bikers as smokers. They should ask each person if they would like a smoking or non smoking room. So now the room doesn't really feel clean. The room was sufficient and the decor was 90's. The bathroom was large and had a large soaking tub and separate shower and so that was nice! My first morning there I placed the hotel ""Do not disturb sign"" in place. They came in anyways. The next night I wanted the room clean...they did not come clean the room and then I found a weird matt stain on the bathroom floor. So do they wash the marble floors between guests? Down in the mezzanine I had a drink with my lunch and the glass was cracked! apx 3 inches of it. I think they were so fast to set the tables they didnt care/notice such a large crack. So lets try the Miracle mile mall.....all very nice. Things of all price points BUT be careful three of the stores there ring up the price by rounding UP! Yes Ocean one charged our friend $48 for a bill that was first shown as 47.24 but the waiter rang it and rounded up. When this was brought to his attention he said they always do that. Its just the way it is done. After my friend made a fuss the waiter all of 20 something...took the bill back. dug in his apron pocket and gave my friend the difference...Do you think THAT problem will ever be resolved? NO so YOU will be the next over charged person! Next stop Popcorn...same thing! one price listed for pop corn but then the over charge and dont have an answer as to why. Ver nice to us but didnt change the price until after the manager was called in....seems that is STANDARD practice there! In the end when I checked out and when I was asked if my stay was ok I told them all that happened...right down to the bathroom floor not being washed. The young girl said she was sorry but my bill was never adjusted. I told her I will never stay there again. You pay a price and have a certain expectation and it just isn't met, period. My convention was good but I will not go back there again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Lots of food-think about sharing. Food is good depending on the item. Egg dishes have always been good. Chicken and Waffles - excellent Oatmeal. Not so good. The oatmeal came with unripe bitter hard green fruit. Not just one piece, but all of the varieties. Ordering issue. If you don't have ripe fruit, just tell me and/or don't serve it. Drinks are good. Pancakes-many varieties - excellent pot hole sized. Service is slow, but friendly and the wait time is really really really long. last time I was told the wait would be 1 hr, but 1.5 hours later we were almost ready to be seated.

 ALRIGHT, I AM PISSED. I Have been a loyal customer for 10 plus years and my whole family brings their cars there, that's 6+ cars we have taken to THIS location for years. I have had a really good experience until yesterday. Apparently this store is under new management and his name is DAVID MENDIVIL and he is an deceiving ass. 1) he denied me the use of my coupon for my oil change 2) told me that ALL OF A SUDDEN my oil change was going to be about $10 more (this includes not being able to use the coupon) because the manufacture of my car requires the expensive oil. All of a sudden after 4 years (my car is an '08) the oil type changed??? He said he couldn't be reliable in case something went wrong...why would something all of a sudden go wrong with the oil you've been in my car for the last 4 years? 3) he was so rude and such an ass 1)My mom went back today to complain to him...and he said and i quote ""i don't care about you couponing people"" (what a dick) 2)My mom asked for the owners information and he said and i quote ""i am not giving you the owners name.. (k dumb dumb i am 24 year old computer whiz..i'll find his info in a heart beat). 3)my mom made him print out all the paper work from 2008 showing and proving the oil that he has been putting in to my car..and it's the cheaper oil that he told me he could no longer sell me..... 4) my mom drove to Honda after this experience today and asked Honda if there was any truth to having certain oils in your car..they said ""no, we might recommend certain oils but we don't mandate or force any particular kind."" I am so offended with how MIKE MENDIVIL treated me and my mother and we are seeking higher actions to call him out and take him out of business. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This was my 2nd trip to the Italian Grotto, I live in old town and try to support the locals. Both times were week days and the place was pretty quiet, we were seated right away and both the waiter (Brandon) and the owner were very nice. I had the chicken fontina and my friend had the chicken benito, both were excellent. Brandon was very attentive and made sure our wine glasses were full. It was my friends birthday and Brandon gave us a free dessert, which was also very good. The owner is sometimes a little loud, but has never been rude. I think it might be the east coast thing. All in all, the prices were good, food was awesome, and our service both times has been exceptional. I love it when the windows are open!! Oh, I did hear they were trying to make some sort of patio. Which would be dog friendly, yuck, I don't like dining with animals. So we'll see.... ",0,0,0,0,1

 Horrible!! The guy that came out to sell me the service spent the whole time hitting on me and trying to get me to buy a cd for his band. He failed to mention that the 3 year contract with ADT would have to be renewed for another 3 years if I moved during the contract! Lame. Plus ADT IS THE WORST . Horrible to deal with and their service doesn't work!! I have an ADT system and my house has been broken into twice!!! The alarm didn't go of either time and the police were not called. They won't let me out of my contact so I will be charged a $700 cancellation fee because I refuse to sign another 3 years with them when I move. Go with another company.

 Loved the ambiance at this restaurant - large beautiful tables and African-themed art throughout. The service was fast and friendly - but we were there on a Monday night, so not very busy. I shared the veggie platter, which was quite large and more than enough for two, and came with fresh salad, a couple of lentil/split pea stews, a chunkier potato and carrot dish and a sauteed dish of spinach/onion/garlic. The food was great. Would've preferred a bit more spice - but everything on the platter was excellent. Veggie platter for two came to about $35 all together. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Roosters is one of the restaurants in town that makes us wish we lived South of Uptown vs. North. Many of the negative reviews reference small portions. That's the point of a tasting/tapas type menu so, if you're into big portions, hit somewhere else. My wife and I have enjoyed everything we have ever ordered and have never felt like any of it was overpriced. I love the chorizo and clams over linguine, have had a couple cuts of beef, many of the salad choices and everything comes out prepared correctly, well seasoned, right temperature, etc. When it comes to the service, we have also always been pleased. Very attentive, quite friendly and know the menu/wine list inside and out. For those complaining that they are offered tap vs. bottled vs. sparkling water... Seriously? That's an issue? If you have some problem with that, it's likely more about you than the restaurant. Make a choice and move on. I order tap cause I want my $ to go to food, wine and service as that is why I'm eating out vs. cooking at home in the first place. Agree with Annie W's 2/22/11 comments on the bar/bartenders as well. Very friendly/funny and, no matter how crowded the bar is and how many people back I am, its always easy to get their attention and get a drink. Finally, if you happen to be dining there with my wife, DO NOT ask for a bite of her coconut cake at dessert! She is rarely possessive over food but for this coconut cake, she makes an exception. You may lose an arm... :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 The first sign of trouble should have been that this Chinatown plaza was almost dead at 11PM on a Friday night. The hours were incorrect on 1900's Yelp page, and almost everything else in this plaza was closed- but we went in to this place when we saw the Chicken & Beer banner. Bizarre to walk in to a club-looking place but we were seated right away. Concept of buzzing a doorbell to get service is odd. And again, the fact that it was completely dead at 11PM on a Friday, should have been a heads up. The menu is ridiculous, composed of pages of Clip-art festooned specials with nonexistent descriptions and then traditional menu pages with dish listings, prices, and photos. Speaking of prices, the ones in the menu range from high to insane: $8 to $24 for soup, $9 for a 7 piece wing order, and shaved ice desserts for $15? Don't even get me started on the beer listing, which shows pricing for your beverage based on CCs- as if they're going to give you an injection or something. Side note, who on earth spends $50 on Miller Lite? ANYONE? Anyway. Tentatively ordered the tempura udon soup and two 7-piece orders of wings (deri-q and mild), and considering there were few to no other customers, it was a considerable wait for our food. While we waited, we were provided with what appeared to be a vase of sticks, and a set of very dated and very dirty/cloudy water glasses. I'm the first person to down copious amounts of water when dining out, but the age and cleanliness (or lack there of) of the waterglasses skeeved me out. But we finally got our food. The tempura udon soup was too hot too eat for a good half hour, by which point the tempura was soggy. Which was irrelevant, considering this $8 bowl of soup consisted of just one piece of shrimp tempura and noodles, with some green onion thrown on for color. The wings though, were a surprise: the first batch (the deri-q) were smaller and served with tiny dishes of some grainy green stuff with a thick, dark brown sauce, almost tasting like soy sauce. It was surprisingly delicious. Second batch of wings (mild) were about twice the size each, very crunchy/crispy, and had a sauce on them that smelled amazing but didn't pack the same punch in flavor. Not sure how this place is open with this pricing and lack of business. Service was spotty- not sure why they had three employees chilling, if only one person is needed to listen for the buzzer and give one-word answers to our questions. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I attended a welcome party/dinner here, a precursory celebration during a wedding weekend. Which was pretty rad, so for anyone looking for a more laid back large group lunch/dinner - perhaps you want to consider VBGB? The sad news, for me at least, is that there isn't much in terms if vegan food options. However, the quinoa salad is in fact terrific (and I'm fine with consuming my calories in fermented liquid format, thank you very much). Even if the quinoa wasn't the only item I could eat, I'm confident I would have still inhaled five cups (approximately? sure felt like it afterwards, whoah) of the stuff. Thankfully everyone else was busy stuffing their faces with pretzels and beer cheese, sliders, etc., so no one really missed the quinoa . . . The secluded side room (complete with a one-person restroom!) and patio are was reserved for us, but as the festivities ended, a dozen of us wandered into the large patio area chockfull of game such as Connect Four, cornhole, ping pong etc. There was a laptop DJ as well and quite a large crowd. The beers, they are impressive. But there's also wine for those of us who try to abstain from beer. I had a few whiskey sours that night as well as they were the ""themed drink"" named after the now wedded couple's dog. I'm sure whatever you have a hankering for - VBGB has it. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The name of this place is simply ""Le Mont."" How do I know? I used to live right next door! It is an elegant restaurant up on Mt. Washington with an incredible view overlooking the three rivers that the old Steelers Three Rivers Football Stadium was named after: Ohio, Allegheny & the Monongahela Rivers. From up here you can see into the new Heinz Field! Across the rivers is the new Pirates Baseball Stadium and the golden triangle of downtown Pittsburgh and bridge after bridge. The food is expensive, but worth it and the view is unbelievable. Be sure you make reservations, because you are not the only person who wants to eat here. Do it in advance so you can sit by the windows. Go on a fireworks night . . . or when the Inland Regatta is happening . . . or during football or baseball season. Ride the tram up from below . .

 Would give Schwartz 10 stars if I could!! This is a must when you are in Montreal. For a NY'er's palate, smoked meat is equivalent to pastrami -- however, with one exception -- because Schwartz's smoked meat is orgasmic. We arrived mid-day on a weekend and there was no wait! We ordered a couple of the smoked meat sandwiches with mustard, cherry coke, fries, and pickles to complete the whole package. Schwartz's smoked meat is tender, juicy, and flavorful -- in my opinion, best when it is hot and steaming! Next time I am back in town, guarantee I will be back for more of Schwartz's. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was able to book a last minute appointment which can be both a good thing and bad thing. But I decided to go because I really like Avada salons. I try to only go to them because their salons are normally a little higher end and I like the extras they include. On paper these things make them stand out as a brand to me and thats why I choose them. I would say the front desk customer service is about a 4 out of 10. The guy was just not overly welcoming or enthusiastic about his job at all. It kinda lead to a few awkward silent moments of standing around for me while I was waiting for my stylist. I ended up loving my haircut. My stylist was really nice and my color turned out amazing. I spent $150 for a cut and color, with the cut I got I feel like I got a really good deal! However, I have decided not to return for a few reasons. Things I liked, -My hairstylist although I can't remember her name (she didn't have business cards and I am terrible with names) I felt like I got a very high quality cut and color. -The quality products. I try to only go to Avada salons. I like their products and I always feel like I come out of with beautiful hair. -No problems with parking -I felt like I paid a reasonable prices for the value I got Things that prevent me from going back, -I didn't feel that the spa like relaxed feeling like I normally do at other Avada salons. Just a little too blah for my taste. With multiple Avada salons in town I believe I will be able to find one that is more what I am looking for. Dust, I saw more dust than I wanted to see. I wouldn't quite call it dirty because that is a big leap. But dusty, yes. -Tipping is not allowed on Cards. For myself it was a choice of no tip or a tip on a credit card based off of what I had in my wallet. I am a former massage therapist I love cash tips too but sometimes you just take what you get. Im not meaning that in a negative way at all but Im a strong believer in if someone wants to tip, they should be able to do it however they please. When I asked about this policy the man at the front told me it was so the hairstylist don't have to pay taxes on it. Currently working in accounting I was turned off by this. However, after I explained that i didn't have any cash on me I was told I could tip on a credit card. I am just not a fan of making the client feel like an inconvenience. -Front Desk Customer Service, I feel like there was a serious lack of customer service. Just because you offer someone water when they walk in doesn't automatically equal great customer service. Overall my visit wasn't bad and it wasn't good at the same time. Therefore I believe 3 stars represents my experience well. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Good quality of food, and very kid friendly. A little pricey, which explains why it isn't 5 stars. Great fire show! My son loved it when they cleaned the grill. The portions are somewhat smaller than I expected. To be quite honest, the whole process of getting your food is a little confusing. I don't like the idea of the public being able to touch their own raw meat for some reason. It grosses me out. All the same....it's adequate but not fantastic. ",0,0,1,0,0

 All of the amazing hype is true. Seriously. If you like comedy, burlesque, amazing acrobatics, and ridiculousness, just do yourself a favor and go see this show.

 In St. Marks's Square in the Venetian Hotel. The service was horrific. Not only did his Spanish speaking friends butt in line, they took 10 minutes to decide (no exaggeration). while we waited He gave them two scoops in a small cup. So when I ordered after them and 2 scoops, he wanted to put it in a Large and charge. The guy's attitude was so surly after questioning him, I really didn't even enjoy my gelato after. I did have 1 scoop of bacio and 1 scoop of amaretto. Cost with tax: $8.11. Ridiculously overpriced. But the gelato wasn't too bad, and this is coming from someone who has been to Italy 4 times. Total of 2 stars: 1 star for the guy being an ass and it being way overpriced, 1 star for actually tasting good. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Was visiting with a group of six buddies from NYC and Detroit this weekend and stopped by around 1a. There was a line, but it moved fairly quickly. DJ was pretty good, was spinning mainly hip-hop and pop, put together some good mixes. The main dance floor was packed with a ratio of at least five to one guys to girls. Underfoot was a massive pile of broken glass and spilled drinks, and there was a ton of people shoving their way through to the bathroom or to try and pick up on one of the aforementioned ladies. With the massive amount of shoving, tight quarters and bodies it felt inevitable that a fight would happen at some point. My buddy ended up in a face-to-face with some belligerent drunk guy who kept bumping into him, but luckily we diffused it without it coming to fisticuffs. Overall, the crowd was a mixed bag, the secondary room was underutilized (empty), the music was solid, and I think I'm getting too old for this scene. Oh yeah, there were definitely some under 20's in the mix. I've gotta imagine there are better options... ",0,1,0,0,0

 High expectations were met from the moment we sat down. When we walked in I expected it to be packed for dinner, but was only about half full. This was out one really nice meal for the trip so we splurged a little. Received comp champagne toast,chicken wing app and shot. The chicken wing was tiny but flavorful. For apps the table got mushroom risotto, crab cake and oysters. Risotto was amazing, very rich and savory. Crabcake was good but I was expecting the best I ever had, which it was a distant second. I have to say for entrees I had to take about 10 minutes to digest the prices. Once I realized it was only money we decided on the 28 ounce prime rib and 12 ounce filet. You must think about 28 ounces...and when it comes to the table it is twice what you imagined. Steaks were cooked to perfection, the entire table savored every bite. Creamed spinach was probably the least favorite thing on the table, and the lobster mashed potatoes were just ok at best. Overall it was a great dining experience. As for the food justifying the price, not so much. Table of six the bill was $600+. I have had equally good meals for half the price so is it worth $100 per person, maybe once but not again.

 Sushi-ko is within walking distance of my house. Ideally, I could take my dogs on a walk, stop by Starbucks, and then swing into Sushi-ko for an occasional Japanese lunch. Except that the food is mediocre. I've eaten at Sushi-ko twice. Both times the service was great. The first time I had what was supposed to be Yaki Noodles with Chicken. They served me LO MEIN with Chicken. Uh, okay. It was slightly greasy and I ate about a third of it before passing on the rest. The second time I was going to a little get-together and decided to surprise everyone with Chirashi, (an arrangement on a rice bowl using various cuts of sushi.) I phoned in for pick-up and gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe the sushi bar is great and the kitchen is just so-so. After paying a bit more than I wanted, I opened up the Chirashi box and it was TINY and uninspiring. One piece of octopus? Two pieces of Tuna? Really? I really wanted to like this place, considering the walking proximity they were to me. But with two sub-par experiences, I'll reserve my sushi cravings for Hokkaido or Ichiza. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I came for a very late lunch / early dinner by myself. One of the sushi chefs at Goyemon said his mother was the chef here and that it was the best Korean food. I've been here several years ago and didn't think much of it then, so I thought I should give it another try. I think I am being generous when I give it 3 stars... It's closer to 2.5 stars. Kimchee is important to me and their kimchee wasn't very good. It wasn't quite ripe and too much fish/ shrimp sauce. (I am Korean and know how to make kimchee... ) I ordered naeng myun in cold broth - always refreshing on a hot day. It was okay- nothing too special. In Los Angeles the restaurants that serve this make the noodles with different grains so that you can actually taste the unique flavors. What I was disappointed about was their paltry side dishes- julienned radish, sweetened fried potato and the pancake and of course the kimchee. it was all just okay. I probably won't be coming back. It was the same a few years back. Maybe it's different for Kalbi - but lots of places to Kalbi well, I think... ",0,0,1,0,0

 I went here yesterday to look at shoes. Right after I started looking in my size, an employee starts roping off the area and rudely tells me that they are closing the area to restock- at 4:30pm! I move to the other area with my size, and a minute later she comes into that area and says the same thing. I have no idea how long it takes them to ""re-stock"" in the middle of the day, but they didn't seem in a hurry. I get better deals and friendlier service at Goodwill. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I tried to find out what to write about this place but all I can say was it was a little bit of a disappointment. The service was really kind but I was still not blown away by the food. We chose to sit inside because first off I hate the thought of insects infesting my food and also I love my air conditioning too much. At first I thought it was nice that the kitchen was open and you could see your food being prepared. Then the smoke came and clouded the whole restaurant. Then the food came...or should I say the kids meal came. The portion was barely enough to feed a 12 year old. However - the food here was good! I just wish I had more. The falafel was soft and the salad was pretty good but I wanted more than a few bites. I guess it's a good strategy - make them want more! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Max Brenner, please come to LA! The desserts are not cheap but they are to die for! This last time my boyfriend and I each got a sundae. He got the peanut butter one and I got the smores.

 I ordered the Philadelphia roll. It was 8 pieces and very fresh. Pricing was good so at $9.99. It's a bit dark, but not uncomfortable. There was a bball game on the tv, which a bit of background noise, although the place was quiet. The counter worker/order taker was friendly and smiled the whole time. It's tasty and fresh! I'd come again, especially since it took them about 5 minutes to make 2 orders. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Let start of saying I used to live in Beijing and chengdu for 10 years so I feel I know Chinese food very well. This is not the food they eat in China, But it is delicious American Chinese food! I read a lot of of the reviews here on yelp. All were pretty much spot on. The pot stickers we really great. Huge and crispy on one side. We came because of the check please review this weekend of this place. We knew from that that we should try the Orange chicken. Very good. The sauce was just right, not to thick not to thin. We also had the Sichuan green beans. Good but we have had far better at the really authentic Sichuan resturant in Phoenix at the Sechwan Palace at the chinese cultural center. We also had the Mongolian beef that a another yelper had suggested. The best dish we had. Finally we had the veggie fried rice. I thought it was ok but my wife thought it was not good. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Five stars for the food, but the service at the order/checkout was the worst I have encountered in several years. Big-time attitude from the ""manager"" and another employee when I arrived for an order I placed at 11:06 a.m. for 11:45 a.m. pick-up. When I tried to get my sandwiches, the two employees told me they ""just got the order."" I was made to feel like I was causing them serious problems, but I just stood there dumbfounded. Change the attitude ASAP or you are going to have a serious downturn in business! ",0,1,0,0,0

 This location has been through a few iterations over the years, but it is now known as Shari's. From what I read in the local paper (http://www.lvrj.com/news/40836542.html) it is a family owned and operated establishment. Upon entering, you can confirm this, as it feels like it. The staff was very friendly. I went on a Sunday ~11am, and the place was jumping. Could have been because of the recent write-up in the RJ, but they said that weekend business has been brisk for awhile now. I had the monstrous breakfast sandwich (it has a funny name that escapes me right now), the wife had a burger, and the kids had pancakces. All was quite good, and nothing felt fake or processed. I am growing tired of the places that just deep fry everything. Not this place. I went for lunch a few days later, had their classic burger, and it too was quite good. They have a sauce with it that is tasty, and they didn't bat an eye when I asked for gravy-fries (I think it must be an East Coast thing). The Chicken Vegetable soup was really excellent, probably the best part of the meal. Very fresh, seasoned just right. I reserve 5 stars for only my favorite haunts, which would leave them at 4 stars. I took one star away, because I feel like when the bill was tallied, it felt a little pricier than it seemed going in. Thus they get 3, which is still good in my book. Oh, one last thing, they use great buns! Not dry and stale like the stuff you get at some places. ",0,0,1,0,0

 One of my favorite nightspots in Vegas. Knocking back a few exquisitely-crafted cocktails here while playing a spirited game of spot-the-hooker is my idea of an evening well spent.

 Tucked away on the strip in the Hawaiian Marketplace area, this is a hidden gem. So I'll admit it was my first time having Indian food. Luckily I was meeting friends who had some knowledge about it and helped me out on what to have. We went 'family style' so we were able to taste a little bit of everything we ordered. First I want to say the service and staff here were amazing. My water glass never went less than half full. Kudos! Our waiter was very helpful also in helping us decide what to get. I would say he went above and beyond! To start off, we tried the Vegetable Samosa's and Vegetable Pakora's. The Samosa's reminded me of an empanada except stuffed with potato and peas. Accompanied with the sauces, these were great! The Pakora's were good also but a little too much breading. For the main course, we went with the Chicken Tikka Masala. The tomato curry sauce over the chicken was good! I scooped this over the basmati rice and was very pleased. As for the chicken and rice dishes, there was plenty to be shared between 3 people and couldn't imagine eating this all myself. We even had much leftover! The garlic naan came out warm, flavorful and perfect. Overall I was delighted for this to be my first Indian food experience. ",0,0,0,1,0

 If it sounds too good to be true it usually is, right? Not in the case of Vegas Club Passes--it's totally legit. I've used their services multiple times in the past few years. It's simple: first go to the site, sign up the number of people going, what days, select the clubs you wish to attend that are available, and you're halfway there. Next, Chris will text you a confirmation the day of (usually late afternoon) confirming that your group is on the guestlist or if any changes need to be made. The great thing is that if you have any questions or concerns you can text him and he responds quickly. Just make sure your group arrives to the clubs before guestlist closes or you've just totally missed the point of the whole thing and end up wasting money on cover. Ladies are usually free for the most part and depending on which club you go to you may get free drinks before midnight. Guys usually just pay half of the usual cover. The only catch for using their services is you have to go to one of the Palms clubs your first night. Moon is okay if you're feeling for more of a lounge atmosphere, I couldn't care less for Ghost Bar, but Rain is definitely the best out of the three and the biggest. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Maybe I hit this place on a bad day. My wife and I stopped in here on a whim for a snack. We split a waffle with whipped cream and strawberries. The waffle was pretty good -- if a bit too sweet for our tastes -- but the tiny little shop was uncomfortable and the service less than cordial. The ""tables"" are thin wooden boards nailed to the wall and it was hard for us to sit and relax on the high rickety stools. I was also put off by the attitude of the young woman behind the counter. There were no other customers when we arrived and she was too busy with something on her smartphone to pay much attention to us. With almost a sigh of annoyance she took our order and prepared the waffle, then went back to her phone before we could even get the sticky, dripping plate of waffle and melting whipped cream back to the ""table"" (only three steps away). For a $5 waffle, I expect friendlier service, and a more comfortable atmosphere. Needless to say, I don't think I'll be going back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I love Ian's! It's such a Madison staple; I always have to stop by when I'm visiting family in WI. Ian's has such a fun variety...everything from mac 'n cheese pizza to baked potato pizza to salad pizza. Yes, salad pizza. I'm personally a big fan of the buffalo chicken with bleu cheese, but I like to try something new every time. So far, not a single experiment has gone poorly for me. The atmosphere feels very much like a college campus. It can be crowded, noisy, and full of students. Depending on when you go (such as lunchtime), the line can get very long, but the service is fast and friendly so the wait is manageable. I highly recommend a trip next time you're on State Street.

 Recently visited with a bigger group so my attention wasn't on the details. Love the decor and it has a similar vibe to Zinc. We started with the tableside guacamole and all i could taste was salt. Also, ordered the almejas with a side of bread for dipping but again way too heavy on the salt. I guess if they are going to err on the side of overseasoning vs. under its better to over to satisfy the masses. Shared the fish and pork tacos with their homemade corn tortillas which were pretty good. Still willing to give them another shot. The staff was friendly but very slow and screwed up the order forgetting one of our dishes. Probably will go back to try out their churros and sit out on the cozy patio out front. ",0,0,1,0,0

Just as good or better than some places back home in NYC. Lots of dishes made with San Marzano tomatoes. Sooo good! Huge portions, took leftovers back to the hotel!

 Laying out at the Beach...where it was only 51 degrees outside made my stay at the Mandalay Bay complete. But damn does this place get crowded with every douchebag and tiny chick imaginable. (Well, this is Vegas.) When I go back in a couple of weeks, I will review the wave pool...which was so reminiscent of my days at summer camp. The cold weather didn't stop a lot of kids and adults for enjoying the wave pool though. I also loved the sand that they had...who knew you could get the beach in Vegas? The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. I was surrounded by the nicest people on the planet. (They were drunk and relaxed...excellent combo) Drinks were a little over the top in prices, but again...it's Vegas. My only major gripe (besides the douchebags and tiny chicks) was the prices of the cabanas. Next time I go, I need to find a rich man (or men) so I can live it up. The best thing was that I left with a sunburn. Success! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Watch out Hot N Juicy Crawfish, you have some competition in Vegas. Yes this is the same Boiling Crab as you can find in San Jose and Southern California. The one difference for the one here in Vegas is that there really is no wait (at least for the couple of times that I have been there). The Boiling Crab is a lot bigger than the ones in Southern California and now have a huge wall of tvs that will be great to watch any sporting event, especially once football season starts. You must get the whole shabang sauce (basically extra butter, garlic and spices) to marinate your selection of seafood. You can select how spicy you like, I usually get medium so I can still taste the seafood flavor of the shrimp and king crab legs. I am not a huge fan of crawfish so I usually don't order that. Other things that are must orders include corn and sausage (added to your shrimp), a side of rice to eat with the sauce, some fresh oysters to start, and maybe a fried fish basket with cajun fries. Overall, a great place to hang out with your friends, eat some great cajun seafood, grab some beers and watch some sporting events. ",0,0,0,1,0

 So happy to find Patel Brothers here. As a devotee of Patel Brothers in NY, I was overjoyed to see a location in my new town. Because I am gluten-free, it can be challenging to find inexpensive gluten-free items. Also, I just love Indian and ethnic food. I get my coconut, sorghum, chickpea, and rice flour from here, as well as various nuts and dried fruits. Spices are inexpensive and can be bought in bulk. I typically do not buy prepared foods, produce, or snacks from here, so cannot comment on the quality of those items. Most of the items I buy are high-turnover staples, so I don't worry too much about time on the shelf. Indian produce can be found at the Charlotte Regional Farmer's Market, so if I need something I usually find it there. Highly recommended :D ",0,0,0,0,1

 Holy cow, this place is big! It's like a grocery store with built in bakery and taco stand. You can make fresh selections from the made to order menu, or you can watch them make the fresh tortillas right in front of you. They also have fresh Salas, sour cream, and guacamole, just pick up some tortillas, some chips and you have an instant fix of Mexican flavors to enjoy on the spot. The pastries are different from the usual flair I have, they are more like biscuits with filling. I have never seen so many types of vegetables in a market. The selection of peppers is incredible! They have a large selection of marinated meats, they didn't smell and looked fresh. We did buy some marinated steak which we cooked up and with our fresh white corn tortillas, Salas, sour cream and guacamole had a nice little taco night for a change. Overall, it's a nice little store and I would love to make it a regular stop. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I usually have nothing but good things to say about this place. I've dealt with Fran and others and have had very good experiences. However, this time was very different. I called to find out how much they might charge to install some brakes and rotors that I had, i was reffered to Mark, the mechanic. I made the appointment with him for Tuesday Sept 30th, he quoted me between $179 - $200 for the work (though the first person I spoke to quoted $150-$179) and told me to bring it at 8am and it would be finished the same day.when I brought it on Tuesday, Septempber 30th at 8 am, Mark forgets that i even made the appointment with him (or didnt bother to make a note of it) saying, ""oh, I thought you were supposed to bring this by yesterday"". He says I should expect this to probably be done before 3pm. I soon recieve a call from Mark at 10:25am, where he tells me the charge will actually be $240 (for four hours of labor + $13 worth of materials, before even getting started to see how long the job would actually take) and that the car would be ready by 3pm, if not possibly before that. Also for good measure he decides to randomly throw in, ""oh, and we don't take checks"". The next phone call is at 3:50pm to ask if i actually need to have the car back today, I tell Mark, ""yes, of course"". (I was expecting to be ready by 3, if not before like he said) When I express that I definitely need it today, he says that he just has to finish this one side and it will be ready by 415. This leaves me with barely enough time to get a bus and get over there before they close at 430. Honestly if what he had to finish on my car could easily be completed between 3:50 and 4:15, i dont think he would bother asking if i still needed to have it that day. As a result I feel that he may have rushed something while putting my car back together, because now something feels slightly off with the feeling of how the cars is aligned or the way the car drifts at times.

 We are loyal fans of Mandalay Bay. We always grab the next promo they have. But these days, we got turn off by these ""resort fees"". When they send promos, the price is on the lower end but if you add the daily resort fees and taxes, they really add up especially these days when money is tight. We love Mandala Bay but if we think about the expenses on the hotel, we always decide to do a staycation instead. Hope they remove the Resort Fess , or at least lower it. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I spend a lot of time here. The employees are helpful and have a sense of humor. This plAce is especially good when looking for a dripper mod that is not a clone. The reason prices here are a little above the norm for most shops is because the hardware is authentic and not a Chinese copy sold for 1/3 the price. The juice selection is pretty large although I am not a fan of one of the brands they carry... It is easily remedied by looking at the other brands they carry. If you need coils or a mod rebuilt they will work as quickly as possible to make sure you get exactly what you want. The best part is that even just people in the shop there (non employees) can teach you things you didn't know about building. Overall pretty good place to go.

 We went here to visit family who happened to be in vegas too. The place was big but very confusing. The first thing that it realized was all of the beautiful girls serving the tables. When we sat down and got situated, we were approached by a sweet looking server. I think her name was Brenda?However as soon as she opened her mouth and started talking to us, it was very apparent that she may have been on some sort of narcotics. So she takes our order and comes back about 5-7 minutes later, she had come back to our table and all of our drinks were empty, so she offered to bring us more. She brought us the second round of drinks and apologized for her own lack of good service . Her apologies how raver seemed more like complaints about the party on the balcony being drunk. About 5 min later she came out with the order and complained about the drunk guys on the balcony a little more and brought us out tab. We quickly paid and left. I was not too impressed.

 I've been brought up to never pay for anything here. I'm always waiting for the hookup (or a date). Don't judge, I can show you the ways. Unfortunately, this means I've only seen like 4 Vegas shows (not including The Lion King which I definitely should have paid for). Fortunately, the green Jabawockee is my friend and offered me a pair of tickets. So my gauge on how good a show is, is ""Would I have paid for that?"" The answer, in this case, is an enthusiastic ""heeeeck yeah."" I LOVE the arts and have so much respect for performers of all kinds. Hip-Hop is my heart so of course I was hype about the bboy element and choreography. I went in completely unaware of what would be presented to me (except for dancing, obviously), so I was pleasantly surprised by the story line and comedic aspects. It's crazy how much emotion they can demonstrate with their bodies without the help of using speech or facial expressions. Was it just me or were some parts kind of scary??? The whole mask thing and then the music and red lights made me nervous! I digress. Long story short, I would have paid for this show, and I'm gonna try and go see it again soon! I was thoroughly entertained, I laughed, not cried, but felt sad, was scared, was hype, got to dance myself, and was astounded by these guys' level of talent. ",0,0,0,1,0

 THE MANGER JACK DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE.. I decided to go this this nail salon because it's close to my house and I had been before and thought it was a nice place. It was suppose to be my SPOT! I was SOOO wrong. First let me just start by saying the manager JACK should be named JACK ASS! I came in on a normal Wednesday after work just to get a pedi and refill for nails. I waited patiently for the staff to do my pedi , I was in no hurry at all. I had my study material for school , so I was prepared to wait. I got my pedi done by Jack and he dug so hard into the side of my toe that it starts hurting with throbbing pain. I smile nicely ( considering the fact that I just got a pedi the week prior , so all that wasn't necessary AT ALL!) . Next I needed a refill. He had a new employee working. I knew he was new because before he started my nails , he had just walked in and the other employee was introducing themselves to him. This nail tech was nice but inexperienced. I wanted a refill so it shouldn't be hard. The shape and length should be the same. He completely messed my nails up,shape and all. He had to take of my nail off and start over because he messed it Up that badly. So I decided to nicely inform him that I'm going to ask another nail tech to finish my nails if it's okay with him. The tech said he didn't mind at all So I informed JACK ( the manager) of this and JACK didn't like it at all. THE VERY FIRST THING THAT CAME OUT HIS MOUTH WAS "" U DO KNOW WE CLOSE AT 7 O'CLOCK . It was 7 by this time and I had been there since 5:10. He didnt apologize on his employee behalf or anything AND he said it with the disgusting attitude. SN:I was put with the nail tech Lynn. Lynn is a great nail tech !! She's nice and know what she's doing. I read another comment and they said the same thing about LYNN and I would have to agree! During the process of get my nails done I'm getting nasty looks from jack which made me feel very uncomfortable. He comes over and starts to help Lynn out and writing up the tab for my nail. He tell me the price and I ask about the breakdown as I always do at ANY nail salon. He tell me that I'm paying for a pedi, refill and two broken nails. I inform he that I had only one broken nail and that his tech had to take the other one off because he messed it up. So he gives me another price but it's the same price as what he said the first time. WARNING: He's a fast talker and he's full of attitude.he justify it by saying he's charging me for something else. He then proceeds by showing me the brochure with the time AND the prices on it by slapping it on the station. So AGAIN he mentions the TIME. I told him it's no problem I'll pay it's no BIG DEAL and he still continue on with attitude After finishing my nail I asked to speak with the manager , which at the time I didn't know he was the manager. He came up to me saying "" yes honey , I'm cleaning how can I help you"" he had an attitude like I was bothering him. I told he I didn't appreciate the way I was treated today. I explained how I patiently waited on his staff and how I show the nail tech courtesy and respect. I explained that I didn't appreciate the disrespect and attitude I received from him. This is when ALL HELL broke loose JACK starts attacking me by yelling and dismissing the fact of how rude he with me. I really thought I was talking with a CHILD with a temper tantrum. He states that I should have let the tech finish my nails and IF I didn't like them then it would be FREE. Now that concept seen stupid to me. Why would I let someone continue on my nails if he's hurting me and I know I'm going to be unsatisfied with the finished product. But the was the advice the Manger, JACK advise me to do. When he finished his statement he dismissed me again by tell me goodnight. I have NEVER been put in a situation or been treated like that before, so I was beyond angry and confused. In a situation like this you would usually call for the manger but my complaint was against the manger, I have no idea of what to do. I knew if I didn't pay I was afraid he would call the cops but on the other hand why is he allowed to treat a customer like that , and still get paid?!?

 When we lived in the boonies, we used to eat at the original Chinos in North Phx. Now we live in Chandler so naturally we gravitated toward the location closest to us. The food has always been good, but the counter service...well...that's the reason my rating is only a 2 out of 5. The rocket scientists they hire to take a simple order need to be administered IQ tests. I ask you, how hard is it to hand a piece of paper to the person who cooks the food? Somehow, this task is far more difficult then I realized. Instead of handing the order to the cooks, our order was placed in the ""DONE"" pile. So naturally, after nearly 30 minutes of waiting, we inquired about our meal. No apology, no remorse - just an ""oh"". Wow, and you want my repeat business? I think not. Eat at Chino, just make the long journey to the location in North Phx. They have their act together at that store. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Was worried this would just be another overpriced new hotel in Vegas, but the rooms were surprisingly well decorated and convenient for a group. There were a ton of mirrors in and outside of the bathroom which was great for 5 girls getting ready. A lot of hotels miss the mark on this one. The shower has blinds on the outside by the beds so if you pull them up you can even put on a show! haha Or be harassed while trying to find privacy when the drunk one is acting silly. Yup, it happened. I'd definitely stay here again, but only with a group to split the cost. I haven't hit the lottery yet. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Because someone highly recommended this place, we tried to have dinner here while it was still located on 7th Street. We opened the door, looked in, and walked out. Food might have been good but the place was just one of those joints that time forgot. I would have overlooked the ambiance had I thought the food was going to compensate. Didn't think that was possible so we didn't stay. Fast forward several years later - the place has now moved (to yet another dicey location). We decided to give it another go because the reviews on Yelp are so good. Food was edible. I just don't get being served spaghetti with marinara sauce with veal piccata (which has lemon and capers). And I especially dislike spaghetti that has the mushiness of Chef Boyardee. Even Old Country Buffet is better than this and they don't charge $16 for the plate. Hubby's sausage and peppers dinner was also edible, but value was definitely missing. Sadly, I didn't get a taste of the delicious bread mentioned by Jason B. So what are the alternatives for Italian food close by? Pino's on Thomas Road and Central has awesome food in a down home kind of environment. Aiello's on Central and Camelback has better food and ambiance for maybe a buck more per plate. Bar seems pretty cool for the ""right"" crowd. ",0,1,0,0,0

 What's better than being drunk AND eating pizza? NOTHING. Exactly, my thoughts! What makes it more fun is that it's known as ""secret pizza"" and it's like $4 a slice. Dude, $4 isn't even gonna get you water in Marquee! The guys in there are hilarious always chatting up the folks, drunk or sober. One of 'em even told me the story of why they call the white pizza, ""the sunset.."" Let it be known that the cheese are the clouds and the tomatoes in the middle are the sunset...So romantic *blushing* Even though mushrooms are my favorite pizza, I really love their white pizza. And all it is is cheese, sauce, and tomatoes. It's sooooo simple and yet, oooohhh so good. In fact, I was debating on writing this review because I don't wanna tooo many people to crowd my fave food spot in Cosmo. But, this was too good not to share! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I can't believe I haven't already reviewed this place. I have been going to the Butcher Block for a few years now. Their meat is high quality as is their service. Try the house made sausage. Jalape \ u00f1o chipotle is my favorite. Their prepared foods are tasty, too. The meatballs with cheese, the gyro meat, and the chocolate lava cake are the prepared foods I have tried. Today I showed up three minutes after closing and was helped with a smile. And my order, ribeye sliced thin for cheese steaks, wasn't the easiest to fulfill. They are so great. This place is a real gem to find in a city like this. It was a great surprise for me when I moved to the neighborhood. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I really really wanted to love this place because the menu makes my mouth water and the ambiance was so nice - the gardens and cozy outdoor seating were so beautiful! We were greeted at our table ten minutes after being seated. We ordered a pitcher of white sangria, the crab and avocado tower, smoked salmon cheesecake and wild mushroom tart. The pitcher of sangria was delicious when it finally arrived (another ten minutes)- the cup had raspberries and a strawberry in it with orange juice and white wine. The crab and avocado tower had corn inside and gazpacho with it. We had to add salt - it was extremely bland. If you just want to taste avocado and crab, you will love it! If you want extra flava', try something else! The smoked salmon cheesecake was disappointing. A little cute cheesecake that looked smooth on the outside, but crumbled into dry cheese balls on the inside with a very tiny portion of smoked salmon served on the side. House cured smoked salmon is one of my most favorite things - this place will not be remembered for this dish. It was the first time I could describe cured salmon as bland! The one good thing that I would eat again and go back for is the wild mushroom tart. Melted cheese over a soft tart with wild mushrooms and leeks - wonderful wonderful savory dish. We never saw our server for most of the meal. If I went back again, I would try one of the big salads I saw at tables around us and that tart again. But I would make sure I went on a day where I had plenty of time for an extremely slow lunch where I don't mind extremely slow service. All in all, comci comca! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Fail! Fail! Fail! I will probably regret this post (much like a drunk dial) later, but the facts are the facts. I had a cosmetic removal procedure done last week and over the weekend my stitches popped open. My daughter was like, ""Mom, your boo-boo is bleeding. Low and behold, one of my sutures popped open. Graphic I know, but it is necessary to illustrate the severity of the situation, and to give you a worst case scenario analysis of Stockton Dermatology. So, I called Stockton Dermatology and the phone service said they wereclosed and you can't leave a message. Also, there was no number in case of emergency except a referral to 911. So, I went to Urgent Care and they tell me they can't help me because I got the stitches somewhere else. Really?!? I will have to review them later. Anyways, I went to the ER and after a 2 hour wait and a $100 copay all ended well. Next step was to cancel follow up at Stockton Dermatology since I already got the stitches out at the ER. Well here was the nail in the coffin for Stockton Dermatology. You can't reach a person on the phone. They are suppose to open their phone lines at 8am on Mondays, but this was not the case. I called at 8:02, 8:05...( and this wasn't Althea time, this was real and actual time. Anyways, after getting frustrated at the fact you can't leave a message to cancel an appointment I let it go until noon when I tried again. Well, now their phone lines are closed due to lunch between 11:30 and 1p! I get breaks...I get normal business hours, but if you are offering surgical procedures you should offer some assistance in case something happens! I am not asking to have a person pick up on the first ring when I call, but some human contact and acknowledgment would be nice. In short, since I can't reach you via phone, I would like to take this opportunity to cancel my appointment for today via Yelp. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I'm divided. I don't really like the way the place looks. I am the last one to complain that decor is old and outdated, because I like un self-conscious outdatedness. Unfortunately, it looked dirty, and by dirty I mean dusty and unscrubbed. I began to wonder if they kept the kitchen as clean as the dining room. The wait was interminable, or seemed so because of the creep sitting next to me who wouldn't stop talking about ""the aliens"". In all actuality, I was probably there for about twenty minutes, having gotten there about 11:15 am. Another note about the dining room is the kitchen obviously has insufficient smoke ventilation. As I waited, my eyes began to sting, and the haze in the room was visible in the sunlight. No dine-in for me. When looking at the menu, I thought the prices seemed slightly high. Once I got my food, I felt that the prices were fair due to portion size. I got the baba ganoush and grape leaves. The grape leaves were awesome. The baba ganoush was interesting, with a consistency that looked like hummus. Totally creamy, no evidence of seeds. It was dosed with so much liquid smoke that it kind of tastes like barbecue sauce. Good at first, kind of sickening after half of it is gone. I wouldn't get it again. I need to try this place one more time and see if my experience is comparable. If it is, I doubt I will be back.

 XS is one of the best looking clubs I've been. Automatic 5 star. Gets really overcrowded after midnight on fridays and saturdays. I recommend coming before 10 to avoid waiting forever in line, unless you're on the guestlist. Decent prices for the tables and cabanas. Alot of beautiful people here so dress to impress. Dance floor can be a bit bigger. It felt like a sardine can there with no room to move around. Same goes with the entire club. There is hardly room to move around the place. Minus one star. Music was ok until they started playing paris hilton when she rolled into the club. total buzz kill. Minus one star. $30 bucks for guys and $20 for ladies. Suggest drinking before coming because it's not worth it unless you're ballin then go for it. If you can, get a cabana. It's worth it if you just wanna hang back, chill, drink and get a good view of girls stripping near the pool. ",0,0,1,0,0

 just spent the day with my husband, 10 yr old son and his friend at carowinds. I now know why tix are so cheap. (37.50 through AAA per person) add to that $15 parking, $58 for 3 nasty burgers and cold fries, 2 slices of pizza and 2 kids milks, $9.48 for 2 sprites and it adds up quickly. if you only want to ride roller coasters, then this is the place for you. no other entertainment was available while we were there. off season I guess. won't make the 3 hour drive again from Charleston. would rather drive a little further and go south to universal. much better value for money spent.

 0 star for the food. 2 stars for the ambiance 0 star for the service I don't even know where to start. Honestly, the reviews are completely deceiving and I was highly disappointed! I was so bummed because we were on a really good streak of eating amazing food in Vegas too! Straight to the point. The entire experience was not at all what we were expecting. The ambiance is really nice however, it is pretty dim -and seemed more like a club/bar lounge than a restaurant. Honestly, I would go to a whole in the wall looking restaurant with delicious food than something that just ""looks"" nice. As an avid sushi consumer, please believe me when I say the food here is a complete disappointment! Save your winnings and go elsewhere-- McDonald's is not too far away you know. What we ordered: I'm so mad right now I don't even remember the names of the food we ordered! But we had a group 10 people. And NO ONE liked their food. The portions seemed to have been aimed for people that are about the size of a 3 yr old with the price of a pasta entree at an Italian restaurant. I mean, really- almost $20 for two less than 4 inch skewers of meat? What the hell is that? No sides- nothing. Just that. My sushi rolls were more bland than an infant's pureed cereal! We were all in disbelief. So much that traded of our sushi rolls with one another to see if it might have been what we ordered that wasn't tasty. Customer service: The waiter was set on how we should order when she came to our table. She heavily ""suggested"" that we order food as a ""family style"" in which every rolls, tempura, skewers and all are placed in the middle of the table and you grab what you eat kinda thing. Considering not everyone eats the same portion or even like the same things -how the hell are you going to split the bill fairly? We decided not to order that way and asked if she could place everyone's items on separate plates. Which didn't end up happening. They squeeze 4 rolls onto one plate which (1.) Looked messy (2.) We couldn't distinguish which roll belonged to who (3.) The flavors and sauce of each roll started to mix together. We didn't even finish our food... we left hungry and went to Chipotle instead. Save yourself money & time and go elsewhere! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Fun atmosphere- not too great food. Took my kids (3 & 8) and we had such poor service. The server gave my kids giant glasses with straws, but then gave the table next to us kiddie cups. When I asked for the same cups she acted all put out and never came back with them. Then she charged me adult beverage prices. We also had to request a to go box three times. I have eaten here three times now- never that great. Street tacos are 75 percent cabbage. They have left the avocado out of my salad . I went once for a school function- the taco station beef tasted like Mc Cormick's taco seasoning. I must admit the chips and black bean salsa are great, but hey it is Arizona we can get that anywhere. I may meet up with the gals for drinks and chips, but not bring my family here ever again.

 First time visiting the Vegas location and I must say it was really tasty!! We had the guacamole and Baja ceviche to start...... Guacamole = good flavor but it needs more heat since I like spicy guacamole. Ceviche = was really good with a good blend of flavors. Dinner HERS - Saut \ u00e9ed Shrimp n scallops = both shrimp and scallops cooked perfectly. MINE - Grilled skirt steak = cooked medium rare was like butter melting in my mouth, the organic black beans, roasted corn and veggies were a perfect flavor compliment to the meat, and the monster flour tortilla was awesome!! Drinks HERS - Prickly pear pi \ u00f1a colada = delicious with the toasted coconut rim MINE - Blood orange Margarita = was a refreshing drink with a little bit of spice! Service/server = Ryan S. was very attentive, courteous and had a pleasant demeanor. Overall this place is really good and we'll definitely be back on future trips. ",0,0,0,0,1

 this is one of the best family restaurants in the Valley.well managed, clean restrooms, spotless dining area, well lite, and superb customer service. our family dine here at least once a week. last week, i ordered a huge order through the Drive Thru: 6 soft chicken tacos, 3 foot long chik burritos, 2 wet burritos, taco salad, 1 carne asada with rice and beans, and 2 foot long beef burritos. i only waited for less than 10 mins from start to finish. the staff is very kind, prompt, friendly, and never gives me a hard time for redeeming the Mailer Coupons. they also give you REAL salsa with each order in one of those Ice Cream single serving styro cups - hot or mild! their catering is a fantastic deal. they pack it extremely well for transporting and the meats were just as tender, soft , juicy, with little bits of burnt crust from being on a real grill. my office staff loves it , our neighbors are addicted to their foot longs, and i am no longer a slave to the hot oven/stove during hot summer days for my 4 kids! thank you so much Baja Taco!

 I have been spending a lot of time in the South West lately, and this is the gym that I go to when I'm there. This is a straight forward, come in get your work done, no nonsense gym. Just like any other 24 Hour Fitness, you check in at the counter with a 10 digit pass-code followed by a finger print scan. Soon there will be a retina scan to assure that no one will be using your $20 a month membership. A walk through the gym to get to the locker room, then off to the gym itself. I have only been able to focus on legs lately because I tweaked my shoulder. So, Squats 4 days a week it is. My only problem is, there is only 2 squat racks. So, if you're not there at an off time you could be waiting for a while. I also like the layout of this gym. There are separate areas for stretching and warming up, as well as a trainers area. And a couple of water fountains for those who forget to bring in their sippy cups. So, this is a great alternative to my usual gym. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I'm not sure why the kind of low rating for this place. we ordered a bunch of apps. the lobster tacos (so small, boo), the yellow tail sashimi (ok, they were cut paper thin for such a hefty price), the cauliflower (really yummy), the kale ceaser (super yummy, we ordered another one), the calamari (yumm). The reason I'm knocking one star off a 5 star review, is because 5 of us ordered the rib eye (delicious), two of us medium and three of us medium rare and by the end of the meal, we were pretty convinced that the two mediums got the medium rares and the one guy who really wanted a medium rare got the medium. That's a bit of a bummer when you pay big bugs for steak.

 ""The food here is lousy! And such small portions!"" Who knew that a quote from classic comedy would so perfectly sum up what has to be one of the most pretentious, expensive, and yet worst restaurants in the South Side. I have been to this place twice and can safely say that I have had enough. The shrimp bruschetta gets a special shout out for being absolutely disgusting. What must have been recently thawed peas and shrimp on top of wet bread. That being said, the waitstaff was pleasant and it is well decorated, but the atmosphere and clientele pretty much personify douchery. I'm convinced that it is only frequented by the people that will buy into anything even remotely having the word Tuscan in it. With all the excellent upscale restaurants in Pittsburgh, it's sad that this place always seems to have a crowd. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I finally had a chance to go here a couple of weeks ago. Overall, I liked the place. The person at the counter was very friendly. They weren't overly busy, but almost every seat was taken. It really did seem like a street taco joint you would find in Mexico, basic seating, little decor, some selection of drinks. Next Positive - CHEAP - $2.00 for an authentic fish taco. Awesome. I ordered two, grabbed a drink and waited for only a few short minutes for my order. First off, I noticed they did a marinated cabbage mixture on the taco, instead of just raw cabbage. I really liked this, they stepped out of the norm. Unfortunately, I didn't particularly care for the flavor of the cabbage, (but that was because of my tastes, not because of their efforts), but with the fish it gave the entire thing a nice flavor. And I had no problem eating them both us in about 2 minutes. Good Stuff! They also give you caramelized onions with your. I love caramelized onions and ate them all. This was an extra touch I hadn't seen. I am sure my breath wasn't all that fantastic, luckily I wasn't going back to an office meeting, but boy were they good! My only negative - I was still hungry - and this was probably my fault, I walked in starving. So I ordered a shrimp taco. The shrimp was marinated in a lime juice mixture, again a touch I liked, I just didn't care for it all that much. It was good, it just isn't my thing. They are on the main street, but if you blink you would drive right by, so you will need to look for the place. Good food, great service. I will be visiting them again soon! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've been here for a couple of races & I don't think of this place as anything special. If you like NASCAR though, then they have plenty of races throughout the year to keep you entertained. Lowe's has the longest race of the year in the Coca-Cola 600, which lasts FOREVER...I have no idea how someone could sit through this whole thing. They also have the All Star race, which is a nice weekend out of the norm of your normal race. For those who aren't the biggest fan of racing, then this is probably what you want to attend, considering they don't go around in circles nearly as long as in normal races. And finally, in the fall they have another race, the Bank of America 500. Nothing is really special about this track, other than your normal huge parking lot after huge parking lot of tailgating. Also, the infield has trailers as well for tailgating. If you're to go to a race, try and get suite tickets, which is easier said than done, but it's well worth. Sitting in the cement stands for hour after hour of passing traffic just doesn't appeal to me, so bring your drinks (you can bring your cooler into the stadium) & get ready to wait for something to happen.

 The Groupon Gods were smiling upon me with this deal! I got a massage, facial, and waxing last Saturday. Making an appointment was super easy, and they'll e-mail you confirmation and a day-before reminder. I hate talking on the phone, so this was a plus. It's located right across the street from Casbah in a converted old house. The interior has a modern, zen-ish feel, and the staff were professional, accommodating and nice. I started with the Primal Relaxation massage, which was a fantastic Swedish massage. The masseuse was skilled and friendly, and she worked her magic as I relaxed on their heated bed. A white noise machine is used, and while it blocked out most of the S Highland Av noise, I could still hear the occasional motorcycle and siren. Next was facial and waxing. The waxing was efficient and not painful. The Seasonal Organic Facial was your typical facial: steam, cleansing, masque, extractions, moisturize. My only complaint is that I still have some marks from a few of the extractions. A few tips: bring quarters for the parking meters & they allow you to tip on a credit card. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Im typically a big fan of Mon Ami Gabi.. Been here several times but this last experience kind of left a bad and sickening taste in my mouth. To start our waiter was very stand-offish... It was very odd. Usually at nice restaurants you receive above adequate service. I have actually had better service at my local IHOP that I received that night. Which was a complete and total bummer. Unfortunately this isnt even the worse event of the evening. So, they're having a special that consisted of bacon wrapped sea bass. They had me at sea bass and put the cherry on top with bacon. Half way through my fish I notice that the middle of the sea bass steak is actually completely UNCOOKED! At first I think i'm imagining things so I have my dining mates look and sure enough.. uncooked! and not a small amount but a pretty substantial portion of meat. I call my waiter over and he does take it back and has the chef finish cooking it but It was all too much for me. Im not sure when I will be back.

 I lived here for 4 years. While I was here they were pretty good. When I was leaving, they provided the worst customer service. First, we had to extend our lease by 1 month and had communicated that on many occasions. However, they waited until the last day to remind us of needing a 30 day written notice. When we stated that they knew that months in advance, they just said give it now and pay us. After we left we got an important package delivered and before USPS had started forwarding. Instead of showing courtesy and sending the letter, they needed a self addressed stamped envelope. Not only are they wasting time but can't they handle the 2 dollars with the exorbitant rent they charge?

 Harmony my %^$!!!!! Ok ok ok...this place definitely has some good quality egg tarts and other treats; but the saleslady/owner is a jerk. We came there when our dollar was only worth 98 cents canadian. So we bought a few things to munch on, and it came out to $12 CANADIAN. We, being stupid, arrogant American tourists, didn't have Canadians and decided to pay in US dollars. As soon as the lady heard that, she told us because of the exchange rate, the price is $14 in US money. Ok....I KNOW she knows how to calculate money, but I offered my help in math anyway. "" it's actually only $12.24 in US money"" I said with a smile. She countered with a smile also, but a bit more annoyed ""no it's $14 in US, if you don't want to pay in US money, maybe you should go to a bank and exchange and come back here with Canadian money. I traveled to the US when our Canadian money was much lowered than your american money. So now it's all good for us that you come here when our money is much better. It's like SWEET revenge."" WHOA..... I didn't expect all that on a Sunday morning. I realized my disadvantaged of being an American surrounded by Canadians, who just came out from churches and hungry (did I mention they have ridiculously beautiful churches?), so I just shut my mouth, paid $14 and got the hell out of there.

 So after reading the reviews for this place I was psyched to finally get my hands on a tasty gyro sandwich. I made the eleven minute drive from my apartment to Mike and Tony's Gyros and Shish-Kabobs and I was rather disappointed. French Fries: Delicious, crispy, golden brown. Crunchy on the outside and just the right amount of soft potatoey-ness on the inside. They were also piping hot and made to order. Gyro: The meat was under-seasoned and the sauce was not very flavorful. I've definitely have had better tasting gyros. The bread was a little crunchy/hard on the edges. Coke: Delicious!!! Maybe it was the rising expectations that led to this Mike and Tony's gyro experience being not so great so I've decided to give them another try in the future.

 I never reviewed his show in the past, but I saw it back in 2005 the last time I was in Vegas. I sat in the front row, so I had good seats. Copperfield did many spellbinding acts. I liked it and thought it was pretty entertaining. The most memorable of his acts was transferring a whole section of the audience to another place, also placing himself on some beach on screen, but it was supposedly happening in real time. At the end, Copperfield shook the hands of those sitting in the first row. He's still performing now, so it's not too late to see him. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Happy hour in the bar is a steal if you can fade the crowds. The prices on the dinner menu are ridiculous when you consider they are a locals place. You can't charge as much or more than every top steakhouse in town and claim you ""love your locals""! Plus with the bar being jam packed and that noise overflowing into the restaurant, who wants to have a $400 meal in that noise? ",0,1,0,0,0

 Disappointing experience, especially considering the expectations we had based on others' reviews. The prices are out of line with the quality of the food & service. We had two specialit \ u00e9s du chef: the veal oscar and the caneton bigorade. The veal was overly breaded, dry and tasteless. The duck was good but not great. The bread provided in the basket was low-quality supermarket grade ""French"" bread. The server left a used knife from the salad course for us to re-use with the main course. OK for a fast-food establishment, but not for a restaurant with pretensions of being something better. The wine list is misleading: it took several requests to find a wine that they actually had, rather than simply listed in print. ",0,1,0,0,0

 A very mediocre hotel experience. We waited probably 40 minutes in line to be checked into the hotel. It was a Monday night. It was $160 for us to stay 2 nights and I have to say, it definitely wasn't worth that. The room was fairly small and our accommodations didn't even include a fridge or microwave. Casino is nice looking, but a lot smaller than ones in a lot of the other hotels along the strip if you're staying to gamble. Staff was mediocre. TV wasn't working properly during our entire stay- not sure if the problem was with the satellite or the tv itself but we weren't getting a proper signal. (However, we did not ask for help because it was not a top priority, so I cannot comment on how the staff handled the problem.) And lastly, they gave us vouchers for free cookies and we couldn't even find the place to redeem them. We looked all over the hotel, even using the map, and could not find the secret place where these supposed free cookies are given out. So no cookies for us :( ",0,1,0,0,0

 Unbelievable hidden gem of a sushi bar tucked in a strip mall at the SW corner of Dysart and McDowell. We absolutely love this place and think it is quite possibly one of the best sushi options in the entire Valley. We've introduced several friends to it, and all of them are shocked that a restaurant this good is in the West Valley. Their sashimi is always top notch, their drink specials great, and their selection of rolls are too many to mention. We especially love the ninja jalapeno appetizer and the Double Double and Cactus rolls. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place is no longer a buffet (that's a good thing :). My GF is from China and she was in heaven at Dynasty after traveling around with me in the USA and only able to find American style Chinese over the past few weeks. Dynasty is authentic Chinese (mainly Sichuan style) and very high quality food. I can semi-accurately make this assessment after living in China for 8 years :). We actually came for the hot pot tonight but they do not begin their hot pot menu until 12/1. Overall excellent food and great and friendly service. Check it out! :) ",0,0,0,0,1

 High Quality, 'Chipotle' Style Mediterranean Food This is as good as it gets! Service is always very very friendly and their food is fresh, home-made, vegan/vegetarian, and tasty! I am always impressed by the quality of vegetables and meats, their gyro is some of my favorite, the grilled chicken a close second. Their hummus is a huge bonus, made in house, they typically have 6 different types that rotate. I can't decide which is my favorite they are all unique and delicious. Lemon ginger is fantastic, you won't find it anywhere else, and the cilantro jalape \ u00f1o is great if you like spice. I recommend any of their 3 or 4 different kale salads as well as their spicy ginger carrots. The 'pita' sized plate is more than enough food for one, and is just around $6 or $7. You won't regret going here. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We ate at Cholla Prime Steakhouse while we were at Casino Az. I have been to this Casino many times before but this was the first time to try this restaurant and this review is only about this restaurant, not the Casino which I rather like. Cholla was not very busy but it was a Tuesday night after all. The service was very good and the chef sent out an amuse bouche of beef tenderloin that was very good. The bread basket was also very good with a nice Pesto based dipping sauce. But that's where the good ends. The salad was pedestrian at best. We ordered the Chef special surf and turf which consisted of New York Strip with two grilled shrimp and potatoes Au Gratin. The steak was void of seasoning and was extremely tough, definitely not prime beef. The shrimp was rubbery and the Au gratin potatoes were tasteless and cold. I could almost give them three stars for having such great service, but the food was just not good for what is supposed to be an upscale steakhouse. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Underwhelming in one word. Service was great and our sommelier was top notch but the food was dull and flavorless. We had a group of 12 and had many of the entrees, appetizers and starters on the menu and no one was impressed.

 I haven't really been a huge fan of KFC, but today I thought I'd give it another shot. The drive thru was the only thing open and the person handling our had to constantly ask what it was I wanted. Even though there was only one car in front of us, the wait to get to window was about 10 minutes. When the lady started handing us our drinks, we noticed that our order was taken wrong after all that. After waiting 5 more minutes for our drinks, they then proceeds to tell us that we had to wait 5 more minutes for them to prepare the chicken. It actually turned out to be 10. The food was obviously reheated, and drinks were overfilled making them a mess to uncomfortable to touch. They also forgot my drink. I won't be coming back ever. ",1,0,0,0,0

 So this might be the only bubble tea place in Madison but its honestly not that great at all. I got a bubble tea with almond and mango flavoring with tapioca pearls.

 This is one of the few times yelp has let me down.... I showed up on a Monday night. Waited to eat until 9 PM, then waited in line a freaking hour to eat. Then once I got past the line, had to wait another 20 minutes in this tiny area to get seated. Finally got seated... and let me tell you for $35 I wouldn't dream of eating here again (our buffets were comped this time), but if they weren't oh man... Food wasn't far superior to other buffets I've been to . In fact I'd choose Mirage buffet over this one in a heartbeat. Ok, so there were some subpar crab legs.. BIG DEAL. Nothing else was delicious. Most of the food wasn't fresh, tasty, or flavorful. I couldn't have been more disappointed. Yelpers, spend your money and more importantly YOUR TIME elsewhere.

 I had a great time last weekend. My hubby had been talking about Federal Pizza and I have been reading all the reviews, that I couldn't wait to visit. We were worried we couldn't get a table, because I've heard the wait it a little long. We decided ahead of time that we were going to sit at the bar. When we got there, we valet, got inside and there were two seats open right in the middle of the bar area, score. We ordered the Manifesto, and since lately I've been easing my way into beers, I asked for some advise and the recommendation was great, it was the Sierra Nevada Kellerweis, I liked it a lot. My hubby had the Four Peaks one. The place was buzzing with energy and the servers were working really hard. It had been about 20 minutes after we ordered and I saw a pizza coming by, it went straight from us to another person at the bar who I thought had gotten there after us, hum, ok, maybe I didn't realize they were here. Ten minutes later, a server/manager? approached us and apologized for having given our pizza away and they made another one and they told us it was on them. That was very classy, because I really didn't know it that pizza I saw go by was mine and they could have just said the kitchen was backed up. Thank you again, Federal Pizza for being so aware and caring about your performance. This was a Saturday early evening and there were people from every age range. We also had the chopped salad which was delicious and for dessert my hubby had been raving about the berry cobbler. I can't wait to come back. I have so many items I want to try. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This is not my first time going to Seville. I have had nothing but good experiences with them until now. I don't know if they have a new hire, but it seemed like it. First off, the launder service is fantastic. They removed a stain without my request (I had no idea it was there) and they replaced a button without my request! fantastic! The reason I gave them three stars... The 4 shirts I had them dryclean (each worth around $180) did not look like they were pressed. The collars were wrinkled, the collar buttons hadn't been undone and the breast and cuffs were wrinkled. I was very dissapointed but didn't find the time to take them back. So if any associate is reading this, please take your time and focus on these issues. You are still the best and I will return without a doubt. I have already sent a friend and he had a fantastic experience as well. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Don't even bother making a reservation. Booked a room there 4 months in advance and got there to find out that they over booked their hotel and had no more rooms available. Ruined my entire twenty first birthday. The manager there was super unprofessional and made up a bull crap excuse why they didn't have rooms available as well as the boy at the front desk. The manager tried to say he'd pay for us to stay in a hotel 20 minutes away at some random hotel he didn't even know where it was located or what it looked like, then after talking about it he said he wouldn't pay at all and just bs'd his way to try and ""make me happy"". I will never go back to this place again and remain to talk trash on this poorly run ""boutique"" motel. Make sure you have a back up plan hotel just incase they do this to you too. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This place is random. R A N D O M random. I don't ""get"" it. Went for lunch, while taking a break from medical testing at the Mayo Clinic. This place was empty. Ok, there were a half dozen other people there, but it barely counts with the size of the place. Now, I like that there is a stage (guess who thought of doing comedy there???!!!) and that they have live music that promotes local bands. I am all for that. But, there comes a point when you can't have the place seem too classy for that sort of thing. Framed pictures of different musical icons are nice, but overplayed. Everywhere else. It just doesn't work here at Compound Grill. I had the fish n chips for lunch. 5 nuggets of fish places over a bowl of fries that weren't anything special. When will people stop serving shoestring fries???? It was cool that everything was served in a bowl made from an old record that had been warped into...the shape of a bowl, though. Service was friendly and attentive. The manager or owner or whoever he was also present. I'm guessing because they though there would be a lunch rush. For this area, in N Phoenix, so close to the 101/51 and N Scottsdale, I would expect a bigger lunch crowd. Without it, I guess shows I'm not the first person to just find the place ""meh.""

 The Best Cupcake In Scotland? That's the award Cuckoo's received and what lured me into their bakery. That and the Yes/No cupcakes for Scottish Independence.

 Dear foodies, I recently visited Windsor for the first time with a guy friend who is also a big foodie. He and I were really excited thinking that their happy hour would end at least by 6 pm like most places, but it ends Very early at 5 pm. That is something that does not make sense to me especially since most people's work days do not end until 5 pm. Moving on... We were seated on the patio, which at first was awesome and beautiful and comfortable since they had the misters on. Then as the sun started to disappear, the mosquitos started to appear. I was badly eaten up around my ankles and on the top of my feet by the mosquitos on the patio. My guy friend had to request that they bring over one of the citronella candles; that helped a little but it was already too late. Now the food... The beers that they have on tap were delicious and I truly enjoyed them. I had the Windsor Style Backyard burger without the bun, wrapped in lettuce. It was perfectly prepared and the toppings complimented the flavor of the burger. I had their Mac-Cheese as a side and was pleasantly surprised. When I think of Mac-n-Cheese, I think of only getting this dish as soul food restaurants normally when I am back East or down south, but they actually did a very good job with the flavors. :) My friend ordered the Ahi Tuna salad, which on the other hand was not as culinary pleasing as my dish. The salad lacked flavor, dressing, and excitement. The Ahi tuna was prepared very well, but the salad portion lacked on various levels. He told one of the servers about his lack of culinary orgasms with the salad and the manager Lisa came out and talked to us and also removed it from our bill. We were not expecting that, but it was a pleasant surprise and I appreciate a customer service driven and involved establishment. Lisa was adorable, professional, and a great listener. With that, I will be back. I am overall impressed with their establishment and the service. Next time I will sit inside and arrive prior to 5 pm to enjoy their happy hour as well. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I had been looking for a lower priced hotel near Freemont and this one came up. I did not really look at the reviews ahead of time because I was in a hurry to get to the Motorcycle show, but i should have... the staff were surely (To put it mildly) but the biggest issue was the bed. My good heavens they were bad. I had asked if they could give us another bed and they could not, and did they have another room, they did but it was $100.00 extra per night because they were almost sold out. When I asked at least for some sort of board or support I was told that I could not modify the bed as it was hotel policy, which I can understand but the result was some really bad back pain and two nights of little if any sleep. I would not be writing if it stopped there, if you go and decide to stay in the four queens, you MUST not stay in the North Tower. It abuts Freemont Street and the music and noise goes on until 2 or 3 am and I stayed in the South Tower and it was still so loud we left the television on to cover the dirty language and yelling that went on after mid-night. I am not complaining that people swore and were out late, it is Vegas after all, I am complaining that I could not get away from it in my room. The room itself was dirty, meaning there was an inordinate amount of dust and dirt behind the dresser as I had to get back there to find a working outlet for the iron I needed for my clothes on Saturday. It must have been a very long time since they cleaned that room because when I moved the chair to get to an outlet I could see the clean spots where the legs of the chair were and the impressions from the chair suggested it had not moved in a very long time. On that note, the iron did not work so I asked for a new one from the desk before 9 am Saturday morning, called the desk again at 6 pm when I got back to my room and found it had not been replaced and again on Sunday morning to only be told on Sunday they did not have any and when I asked why they promised replacement the two prior times I called the girl said ""How should I know, I am not the one who said we would replace it"" The bathroom was missing some of its molding on the ceiling and around the sink. Not all of it, just sections and in the case of the sink, the exposed area was covered in another kind of mold. If all of this was not enough, when we asked the valet for our car on Sunday at noon time, we were waiting for over 30 minutes when we went in and there was a new person at the desk and she said there was no note from the person she was replacing so she sent someone out for the car. The other person went home for the day minutes after we requested the car. We got the car and the change from the cup holder I have for tolls was gone. Not much money, maybe five dollars, but really? That was so low class it was just the last straw. In summary, don't stay there. It is not worth the physical pain, the emotional stress or the crappy conditions, for any amount of money saved.

 I come here a couple times every summer to catch 80's hair metal bands that are past their prime. I always get lawn seats, which are super cheap for most shows, and then me and my friends pregame in the parking lot. It is usually a good time but I attribute that to good company and being able to tease the hell out of my hair. I really don't care for the venue at all. Half the time the screens on the lawn aren't on so you can't really see shit. The e-mails live nation sends out stating what is prohibited in the venue are usually wrong. For one show this year they sent out an email saying no blankets, towels or lawn chairs. Then when we got there everyone had blankets and chairs. Lame. The thing that pisses me off the most about this place though is that they charge $11 for a 24oz beer. A $3 increase from what they were charging last year. It's cool though, I've become a master at sneaking in mini bottles. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Loved it! Tried it out for the first time and were so pleasantly surprised! Started with a refreshing mojito, followed by their complimentary salsa and bean dip. I ordered the fish tacos and my boyfriend got the chicken steak skillet. The fish tacos were so goood!! Fish was flaky and tasty. The flour tortillas were out of this world and all the toppings brought the entire package to the next level. Their guacamole was fresh and tasty. My boyfriend skillet was seared with tequila table side, mini show :), the meat was tender, juicy and flavorful. They also had live music by a very talented gentleman, makes for a great atmosphere. Would highly recommend this place for a night out. It's a little on the fancy side, but then again it's in Summerlin, so it should be. Service was great!

 After an unsuccessful Yelper excursion attempt to Pike's for late night desserts, I decided to stop by for lunch today instead. The atmosphere is interesting. It's casual and quaint, but set in a somewhat industrial styled brick building. Picture old wooden booths with coat hooks and large gilded mirrors set against a ceiling of exposed air ducts and dropped track lighting. We were greeted warmly at the door, guided to our table quickly and our orders were taken promptly. Their menu selection features traditional American favorites, some with Southern twists. Choose your own fixin's style burgers, meatloaf sandwiches, chicken tenders are just some of the selections. Their ""made from scratch"" soups caught my eye, but today's selection was potato bacon and sounded a little too heavy for my tastes. Our food was delivered within a reasonable time frame. My cheeseburger was good, somewhere between the mark of Five Guys and Penguin's. Fries were crisp, without the taste of old frying oil (my pet peeve). My husband's turkey burger was pretty tasty, seasoned with plenty of flavored seasoning salt. We finished lunch with the Tollhouse Pie, a chocolate chip cookie baked in a pie crust, topped with vanilla ice cream and fudge. It tasted just as I hoped. Warm, chocolaty, rich, but balanced by the ice cream - an American classic. My one criticism would be the restrooms which are in dire need of remodeling. I shudder if the old adage of judging a restaurant by their bathroom is really true. At any rate, the dining room atmosphere, food and dessert were all enjoyable. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We made reservations here since we were seeing a concert at the MGM Arena. I highly recommend making reservations online before coming since there were many people waiting to get a table. But that being said, I wouldn't recommend the food. Here it goes... we started off with the pretzel and cheese appetizer. Pretzels good but the cheese was not. Bummer. I had ordered the nachos off of the appetizer menu. Honestly I wish he would have told me how huge this was. I could've been split easily between 4 people. This jicama relish on top was not very good. Spending this much on nachos I was hoping was something tastier. My husband ordered the Champ burger... a $19 burger. Was it worth it? Nope. I had a taste and was disappointed. The service on the other hand was impeccable. There were constantly people coming over to refill our drinks. Our food was out quickly and our waiter was very friendly and professional. $70 later, you would think it would have been a better meal. Bummed. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have mixed feelings about my first proper dining experience at STK. Went here last night with a large group... I had the ribeye and thought it was good, but it didn't blow me away. From the sounds of everyone else, they enjoyed their food a lot more than I did. The house bread was great, I tried a salad that was very good, but the steak itself just wasn't anything to write home about. On top of that, the restaurant had a club-like atmosphere with a DJ spinning some pretty good tracks, people were dancing, and I even saw sparklers when someone bought a bottle. I gotta say it's weird when you're trying to eat a meal and talk to your friends to be yelling. That said, this would be a great spot to go to if you were looking to party with your friends but didn't want the crowds and super overpriced drinks of a club. Probably won't be back anytime soon, but I don't think I'm STK's target market. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We went here because we were looking for another restaurant and couldn't find it. The parking was a little weird. We accidentally got on the highway trying get into the parking lot. To start, the hostess a flat out cunt. I honestly think calling her a bitch would be giving her credit. The server didn't arrive at the table for close to five minutes. The complimentary chips and salsa/dip didn't arrive until after he took our order for nachos. He recommended we try the new New Mexico Red Chili sauce on our food with chopped chilies if we like spicy food. We took the bait. I'll admit, the niceness of the server almost redeemed the cunt hostess. The food was bland, however spicy and not bad, but not good either. We drove way out of way to find a restaurant we couldn't find and ended up here instead. Needless to say we won't be returning. The cunt at the front door and the food left a bad taste in my mouth.

 Club Tattoo is a great place to go to get pierced! This shop, that used to be located in more South Scottsdale, is extremely clean and very aesthetically pleasing. The piercer I usually prefer is Plaid, and although he has his unique personality, he is phenomenal at what he does! I've gotten several piercings from him (triple flat, navel, and tongue frenulum) , and his is very professional, knows how to do his job and is insightful. Their prices are extremely reasonable, as they include the price of the piercing and the jewelery in one. The thing I like best is that they let you pick the jewelery you want from the beginning versus making you get pierced with the generic white crystal or silver ball colors like some other places do. I have some pictures attached of the piercings I've gotten!

 This was my first visit here, we had guests from out of town and this was a favorite for one of them so we figured we would try it. I was surprised by how expensive it was, I guess I was expecting something different. I ended up having the spicy chicken wrap ( I think that's what it was called) and when it came to the table it was huge!! So the portion sizes are definitely more than generous but I wasn't impressed with the taste. I thought it was pretty bland for supposedly being a spicy dish. Not something I would order again.

 this review is for their to-go counter. i wish they had 2 cashier locations. it's quite a cluster fuck when everyone is trying to check out at one cashier location: people waiting in the line for pastries/sandwiches/gelato and more people wanting to just buy cookies/chocolate boxes. 2 things to get: -chocolate covered rice krispies (perfect combo of crispy from the rice kris pies, chewy and sweet from the marshmallows, and bitter from the dark chocolate. now only if they added some fleur de sel to balance all the flavors! Payard and I should collaborate) -almond chocolate croissant (sliced almonds on the outside with an almondy paste topping, filled with dark chocolate on the inside. i wish they could toast the croissant a bit) there's also a small cafe in case you'd like to sit down for a hot breakfast. there's also small tables outside the shop to enjoy your pastry and gelato! i do feel that jean-phillipe patisserie in Aria has a more enticing sweets selection (pistachio, strawberry, chocolate rice krispy balls!)

We wanted the potato skins (which they were out of) so ended up taking home a Reuben. The Reuben was put on 2 pieces of white bread, so weird. The meat was OK but that bread just put me off. Oh well, win some loose some. Maybe I will give it another try when wanting a drink and some second hand smoke. Either way, cool place for the college/hipster crowd, but just didn't work for me.

 I went there for a surprise birthday dinner. We flew in from San Diego and had dinner arranged there at 8. I was expecting fine dinning experience and the hospitality of this place is far from acceptable. The waitress there cant stop telling us how we used the wrong knife for butter. Don't know to ask before taking the plate away to make sure we are done with that dish or not. She ended up offending the birthday person several times ('Fine Dinning'). Finally we asked the manager to give us a different waitress for the table. The manager after listening to all this said 'we don't have anyone else right now to replace her'. I at least expected that a manager of a so called fine dining should be able to take up the role of a waitress and resolve a situation like this. Either ways, I am used to going to fine dining restaurants in San Diego and OC on a regular basis and this place needs a lot of training to reach the standards of the industry. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I took my dog in here for the first time since I have moved to the area. They did a good job but as soon as I walked in I get a whole speal on how my dog was hyper and cried too much. I feel bad because I feel like I can't take my dog anywhere to get groomed because of his insecurities. It is a good place though if your dog won't miss you when you leave him or her. Also if you expect to pay cash bring the exact change because they do no have any change. I was forced to give them a $20 tip...ouch! ",0,0,1,0,0

 This place was a hole in the wall across from the hospital. The tables are no-fuss and the place definitely has a strip mall vibe. That said, the salad was amazing. For just $6.50 I received a ""small"" salad--a large container of mixed greens, romaine lettuce, chicken, blue cheese, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, candied walnuts, and craisins. The fruit was extremely fresh and was so flavorful that I didn't even need any dressing. I had to wait a while for the food to be made, but that is because the chicken was piping hot when I received it. They clearly cooked the chicken to order. I would highly recommend D'Lish for fresh food that just makes you feel better after eating it. ",0,0,0,0,1

 The first time I went here was for a pedicure and it was excellent! The tubs were clean and sanitized, as were the tools used for the pedicure. They use a type of chemical for your heels to slough off dead skin instead of a razor (this remover cost $3, but is well worth it). Then they do a nice calf and foot massage at the end. I also noticed that they did gel nails, so I decided I would come back for those the next week. And so I did...I walked in and asked for pink and white gels. They were oh so happy to oblige. I sat down and the girl immediately got to work. She started the sanding down of the nail and applied the white tips...and this is when it started to go down hill. The girl was distracted and said she had to do something in the back, but would be back in a moment. So I said okay...no biggie. I can wait a minute. The guy sitting next to her said he would finish for her (which is a good thing, because she didn't come back for about 20 minutes). So I moved over and he started his work. Everything was going as normal...until he started to apply the ""gel."" The ""gel"" came in powder form. Hmmm...gel...in powder form? How does that even make sense? OH, yeah...that would be because it isn't gel. It's acrylic and they use a gel topcoat/nail polish on top. Yet, they charge you more. It's a total scam. Regardless, I was leaving town the next day and just let them do their thing. After I paid and left I really started looking at my nails...and they were CROOKED! Not only was the filing off (completely lopsided on a few nails - luckily that can be remedied with a nail file), but so were a couple of the tips! When she put them on, she didn't even check to make sure they were straight! To make matters worse, these nails yellowed! That can happen when a cheap acrylic is used and is exposed to any type of UV light, aka tanning beds...or if you spend an excessive amount of time outside. I thought maybe it was just the surface that yellowed, but when I got them taken off today (in favor of REAL gel nails at another salon) I noticed they were yellowed all the way through! IF it's yellow all the way through, it's most likely that you have cheap or even toxic MMA Acrylic on your nails!! Needless to say, while their pedicures are nice...I will not be frequenting this place again...ESPECIALLY for nails. ",0,1,0,0,0

 YUMM CORNBREAD. This place probably has the best cornbread I've ever had in my life. Period. I was in town for a day, and wanted to pick up somethingfor the road. My colleagues recommended Mert's, and I'm glad I went. I ordered a catfish, collard greens, and acorn squash for me, and a beef tips, mac n' cheese, and collard greens for the special guy picking me up from the airport. I gobbled down the cornbread right away, it was so delicious. Now I know nothing tastes as good as when it's first made, but for surviving a 10-hour trip, these meals were pretty darn good. Highly recommend! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Rooms are comfortable and spacious here but the bathrooms are atrociously small. The pool is quite nice but again, smaller than it looks in the website. The casino is BORING. The buffet is decent.

 Nickel PBR night at Todd English P.U.B. can safely be called the busiest event going on at City Center on a Tuesday night. This should come as no surprise. NICKEL PBR. Need I say more? I went here for dinner and beer with my boyfriend and some friends. I was surprised by their selection of beers. Not quite as large as Yardhouse, but impressive nonetheless. I ordered a Kronenbourg 1664, which is a usual of mine. I had some trouble ordering from the menu because nothing was exactly how I would like it and I prefer not to be one of those ""Can I get the bacon cheeseburger, no cheese, no bacon?"" kind of people. So I got the double cheeseburger, sans the double. The best way to judge a restaurant, particularly a casual restaurant, is to have the burger. If they can make a good burger, then I can confidently order from the rest of the menu. P.U.B. did not disappoint. The burger was delicious; seasoned properly and cooked to perfection. Despite being over-sized, the bun was awesome. To top it all off, the seasoned skinny fries were fantastic. Once the beer, burger, and fries were gone, it was time. Bring on the PBR. Let's just say, you get what you pay for. Who says you can't buy anything for a nickel anymore? One nickel can buy you a plastic cup filled with the beer that has been an American icon and beloved by Midwesterners for decades. May not have lived up to my Kronenbourg 1664, but it made for good times. Overall, I enjoyed the experience at Todd English P.U.B. The prices were typical Las Vegas Strip prices and apparently low for City Center. The staff still had that ""I don't know what I am doing"" attitude, but our waiter was decent. I can't say that you'll be able to find me there every Tuesday night, but I'm sure that was not my last visit. If you want some slightly overpriced, slightly better-than-expected burgers, and nickel PBR, Todd English P.U.B. is what you want. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I came to MTO Cafe the second day it had opened. Like Bonnie C., I too am confused how there are reviews about the place before it had opened. The reviewers don't mention a soft-opening.... Anywho, I must say that I was very excited to check the place out, since another place to eat lunch downtown is always welcome. But in this case I have to say I left a little sad. I had checked out their menu before heading over and had my eye on a couple of items. We were promptly seated and brought our drinks and while my friend perused the menu I checked out the d \ u00e9cor. The place looks great, with nice big windows and a 50's diner meets modern bistro vibe. I ordered the Queso Carne, per the menu is skirt steak, velveeta cheese and red wine drunken onions. The waitress said it was a wrap. My friend ordered the Tree Hugger, with quinoa and veggies. The waitress asked my friend if he wanted any sides and my friend said no. When she brought out his dish we saw that it LITERALLY was just the quinoa patty. No bread, no sides. What?!? Granted, she did ask if he wanted a side, but if she had specified how diminutive the dish was he might've ordered something else. My dish came on a hamburger bun (which was really good, btw) not a wrap as the waitress had said. It had fries with it, which were fresh and tasty, although the menu did not specify it came with fries. I think there should be a bit of consistency on the menu, how can some dishes come with a side and others don't? My burger was ok, the meat wasn't really skirt steak, and it was more like little cubes of meat. I think our meals were overpriced. We left feeling a bit deflated. I will be back to give them another try for their breakfast because I've seen pictures of the dishes and they look larger than the lunch dishes. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've never been a fan of Radio Shack. Ever since I was young I've been treated to sexist behavior from Radio Shack employees, as if it's part of the Radio Shack culture. That may have changed now that more women work there, but my early experiences totally turned me off from this place. That being said, in a pinch I will go to one for a cable or something. I needed an audio jack and they had a 3-ft one for $9.99. I said, ""No thanks"" and bought a 6 ft one for $9.98 at Walmart. Ahh, Walmart, the store I love to hate. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Seems like this show actually goes back to Cirque's ""roots"", as it was filled with what I'll call traditional acrobatics. I am going to say it was almost terrifying to see most of the performers fly through the air without guidewires. It was flawless. NOT a spectacle, though, ""O"", or a theme like Michael Jackson One or Love. I would see it again. I do want to pass along a tip. I bought my tickets at a supposed ""locals only"" offer for some excellent orchestra seats. Did ask--""are you sure I can't get these cheaper elsewhere, like at a half-price tickets booth?"" ""No, Sir."" ""Are you sure?"" ""Yes, Sir."" I asked if there was EVER any discounts for the show elsewhere and was told no. So I forked out $200, before fees, to box office. You can only imagine how I felt when I happened upon people--in my row and section, with the discounted tickets---at $70 less than mine. So forego the box office or cirquedesolelil.com if you can. You will get a much cheaper deal through a discounter or reseller dumping the show's seats. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have not stayed here, but did purchase a room for a family member staying in town. To be honest I did go check out the room before the family arrived. When checking in I was told it was ready but when I got up there, it looked like only half the place had been cleaned. I called housekeeping, letting them know there was still dirty used towels on the floor, garbage to be taken, and new towels were needed. Well someone came to bring new towels, he had no cart with him to finish the room. I asked if he could at least grab the dirties off the floor and he still left a used bath mat and a used wash cloth on the floor. So much for housekeeping. Can't say much for the rest of the hotel but it does smell pretty gross. Anyone who says they can't smell that perfume stench must have something wrong with their sniffer. Don't bother playing blackjack on the machines, there is no parlay button, and that's not very fun. I signed up for a players card and was given nothing, while my husband signed up for a card and got 25 bucks in free slot play. I did enjoy the Grand Lux Cafe and the coffee shop near the garage.

 I've never had sushi before, so when my friends recommended we go out for sushi on New Year's Eve, I was a bit apprehensive. Sushiya Japan is located in the Arboretum near the second entrance off Providence (the Qdoba/Chili's corner). I've seen it multiple times, but it never really registered to me. When I entered the building, I was surprised at how nice it was. Hardwood floors and dimmed lights made it appear very upscale and trendy for being in the Arboretum. It was mostly empty except for two couples at side tables. Our drink orders were immediately taken and it only took a few minutes to get the drinks. We then ordered our food. I, and most of my friends, ordered the California Roll sushi. It was super affordable at $4.25 for eight rolls. The presentation was gorgeous and the service was ridiculously fast. Our waiter was so kind and constantly checked on our drinks and food. I found the sushi to be okay. I've never had sushi before and I'm not a huge fan of anything that is in the California Roll, so that's probably to be expected. My friends, who have had sushi before, both liked and hated the California Roll. The salads were delicious and several other foods that were ordered by my counterparts were really great (meat dishes). My final bill (for sweet tea with tons of free refills and the California Roll sushi, with tip included) was around $8. Overall, the great service will have me going back to Sushiya (tonight, actually). I'll definitely try something different next time, but this place is pretty good for the price. Definitely a standout in comparison to the other eateries at the Arboretum. ",0,0,0,1,0

 It wasn't bad, it wasn't great. I liked the whole check in process. It was very organized and very professional. The directions they gave us to our room could've been better, and it would have been nice to have a taxi company's name and number listed by the phone in our room, because I could NOT figure out the bus schedules. I didn't like the fact that when I tried to walk to the Stratosphere I had to walk allllllllllll the way around the building instead of being able to just walk right out to the street. ** Whatever you do, don't use the shampoo that they give you in your hotel room!

 Headed here after work for a Happy Hour with friends. The place was deserted, but they have some good specials and their happy lasts until 8, score. Well drinks are $2 and there are some good beer specials as well. We ordered some bar grub as well, which is 50% off during happy hour. The food wasn't horrible. Pretty tasty for the price I feel. The only problem with this place is the service. It was horrible. Our waitress would disappear for long periods of time and it took about 30 minutes for any of our food items to come out. Refills were pretty hard to come by as well. I noticed that the waitress was the only one in the entire establishment, but given the fact that there were so few patrons, I don't think that should account for the slow service. I've been on previous occasions and had better service, so I'm hoping that was a freak occurrence. I'd probably come back if I'm in the area again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Ate at Flavors for breakfast and lunch recently while visiting Las Vegas. In years past, I enjoyed this buffet, but no more after two tries. Breakfast: A complete rip-off at $18. The $5 breakfast buffet (with card) at Palace Station had more tastier selections. While everything I had was meh to mediocre, the bacon stood out as being particularly bad. It was served in a bin in bits and crumbly pieces instead of strips. The waitress never came over to serve us our drinks - I had to get the manager, Lunch: Again, at $24 a complete rip-off for very limited selections and an almost non-existent salad bar. None of the food is what one would consider premium, and was on par (if not as good) as a Golden Corral buffet. Belileve me, if you must eat a buffet on the Strip or near Strip with similar or slightly higher prices, you will do much better at Le Village in Paris, Spice Market in Planet Hollywood, or Carnival World in Rio.

 My love affair with Pita Jungle is a long one.....perhaps longer than any other restaurant, certainly longer than I can remember, and at least for the adult portion of my life, which is why it pains me to write this review. For the last 6 months, I have ordered takeout one day a week from this location, typically on a Friday or Saturday. The ridiculousness that has become my adult life has necessitated a heavy reliance on takeout for my main source of nourishment. Although the food is always spot on at Pita, my takeout experience has been anything but. The prior 3 out of 4 times I went to pick up my food, I ended up waiting past the promised time. Now I'm not unreasonable, waiting 5 or 10 minutes is not a big deal, but each time has been a wait of 25 to 30+ minutes past the pick up time, with no apologies or explanations. I was beginning to wonder if they had ever started cooking my food before I got there. The last time I must've looked really irritated, because I was offered an obligatory baklava for my wait. Used to the wait, I started showing up 5 to 10 minutes past the promised time, just as preventative maintenance. Imagine my surprise when my order was ready as promised thie time. I left with my bag of food and a smile on my face. I get back to my friend's house, open the bag, and begin to realize just how badly the order has been screwed up. We ordered 4 items, 3 of which were wrong. I load one item up and head back to Pita. Making me wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food is one thing, but blatantly screwing up my order is too much. As I explain my situation to the takeout girl, she goes to get the Manager who proceeds to inform me that I ordered it wrong. As I struggle to keep my cool, I inform them that they must be mistaken. One item was ordered with chicken, my item was turkey, and the other two were salads. Everything came with chicken. The salads were for my vegetarian friends, and I'm allergic to chicken. There's no way you're going to convince me I ordered chicken for myself and two vegetarians. Sorry, try again. Without too much ado, the correct dishes were provided, and yet another obligatory baklava was offered. I declined. There is only so much wrong that baklava can right. Don't get me wrong, their baklava is amazing, but it's not going to make up for them screwing up my order, then trying to blame it on me. Oh, and did I mention that they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer? Too bad the coupon expires in a few days. I'm afraid I will be taking my weekly Friday takeout business elsewhere, until enough time has passed that maybe, just maybe, I can find it in my heart to forgive Pita Jungle. In the meantime, I suggest you try to get it together down there. In case you missed the count, that's 4 out of the last 5 takeouts you missed the mark on, including 1 you tried to blame on me. That's shameful. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Good service and even better food! I went in late on a weekday lunchtime for a sandwich so they were pretty much shutting up. The staff were friendly though and happy to have a look about to see what they had left. I went for a 'mexican' sandwich off the specials board. Freshly cooked (I assume) breadcrumbed chicken, salsa, guacamole, rocket, jalape \ u00f1os, and no doubt some other things I can't remember. All the ingredients were great, from the bread to the rocket and especially the chicken. The combination worked really well too, it's good to get something that has had a bit of thought put into the flavours rather than just chucked together. All in all a great visit, and cheap too for what I got. I'll certainly be returning a bit earlier next time and maybe sometime to try the restaurant/cafe for a sit in meal. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Never ever again! We got a coupon book advertising the $6.99 buffet but were rudely told that the offer is onlty good during the week and we needed to pay $12.99 for breakfast buffet! I tried to kindly reason that ""Well your coupon doesn't specifiy that information, so you should honor what you advertise"" but no luck it was either $12.99 or take the long monorail back to someother crappy food establishment. Food was incredibly plain and/or wierd - no fancy breakfast buffet items that would expect like pancakes or muffins. It looked like they just used week old fruit and reheated or fried items from previous lunch or dinner buffets. The decor was old , seating uncomfortable and just plain ghetto. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Placed an order for delivery on my way home during the evening rush hour since I hadn't eaten all day and didn't have my wallet on me. Order consisted of a $3.50 gyro, a falafel combo plate (with drink and fries), and dolmas (stuffed grape leaves). I didn't expect it to arrive too quickly, which was okay. And... it didn't. Took about 75 minutes. The guy who took my order and delivered was very nice, offering to refund one of the items. Yeah, he must have forgotten (or lied), 'cause I checked my account a couple days later, and nothing has changed price wise. Now, the good: - $3.50 gyros (pronounced GUY-ROS by this place...) are tasty, filling, and, best of all, cheap - Lemon dressing on the side salad that came with the dolmas plate - ONE of the pitas was extremely soft, chewy, and super delicious The okay: - Dolmas had good flavor but the rice inside was a little mushier than I preferred. Don't think this is a delivery issue because the dolmas sold by Whole Foods are all lumped together in a container and don't lose their consistency The ugly: - Falafel were super dry and kinda hard. - The other two pitas were burnt in places. - French fries were soggy and tasteless. NOTE: this was a delivery issue, so if you eat in or pick it up this might not be a problem. - Failed to deliver on his promise. Would have given this place a 3 for the excellent and cheap gyros, but because the guy made a promise that he didn't bother keeping, had to rate it one star down. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I will not lie...my yelp love can be bought! This place is probably a 3.5 star restaurant, but I'll round up given the fact that the sushi chef gave us a complimentary poke salad =) Gotta love the freebies! There are disclaimers to this review...North Las Vegas is not foodie heaven...in fact restaurants close early and there are limited options. With that said, this place is pretty legit for rolls and the fish is decent. They have a big sign outside that says 50% off sushi...which is slightly misleading since their happy hour rolls are 15% off.... The rolls are typical of pretty much every average sushi restaurant, but the service was attentive and free food always wins me over. The tempura cheesecake seemed like a creative dessert, but slightly lack luster.... I'll probably be back given the close location to my home and they are open later than many of the other sushi places in North Las Vegas. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I ordered the rainbow roll and was very disappointed..It had some sort of mush inside the roll(looked like tuna from a can), and the different fish on top didn't taste or look fresh. The actual restaurant itself was very nicely decorated and had a friendly staff. However, I came for the sushi not for anything else.. big disappointment, especially for the price point. (around $18 for one order-around 6 to 8 peices). The other people in my party thought their orders were mediocre. I'm not sure if everyone else on here that gave it 5 stars might quite possibly have been drunk (it is vegas)...which I know when I'm a lil tipsy, everything tastes yummy..lol ",0,1,0,0,0

 We stayed three nights here, ate at Il Fornail and gambled. THE GOOD: Great location if you are driving from the airport. Easy off and on from the freeway! Close to MGM, Monte Carlo, Excalibur and Luxor, plus you can catch the tram across the street. The Canyon store across the street also has a big selection of alcohol and lots of nic nacs you might need that you forgot at home. Close to Ross Store too if you need clothes while you are there! Easy walk to Bellagio for the light show and the many other hotels and shopping down the strip. We got upgraded from the Park room to the Madison room which was roomier and very nice. They were out of Strip views but we got a great room on the 28/29 floors with a great view anyway. The matresses were very comfortable! Free newspaper each day at the little store near the exit to the parking garage. All the staff I dealt with was very friendly. I never came across anybody with attitude or rudeness. Free wi-fi included with the resort fee (see resort fee under THE BAD). Check-in as quick on a Wednesday night but each time I passed by the line was always much shorter than what I have experienced at Excalibur and MGM. THE BAD: Our room the first night was next to some up-all-night party goers... it was so noisy and the hub did not sleep very well. We asked for a new room the next night and the people next to us were not as noisy but they were still loud and noisy, just not up all night! The walls are too thin if you get the adjoining rooms. As for rooms that don't adjoin and that might be better. There is a $20 resort fee (typical I think of all the hotels on the strip) per night so even if you have comped room you still pay the resort fee. They did tell me at the check-in that if you play enough, you can use your comps to offset the resort fee. We asked for a cork screw and wine glasses and there was a $5 fee for each plus a delivery fee added on from room service!!!! OUCH! I did not win any money on the slot machines but it was fun and they did let me play for a while... Overall a good visit and I might return if I find another good deal! ",0,0,1,0,0

 The class we took today was ""Level 1 & 2"" with Sherry Goldstein herself. Before we went into class, she introduced herself to us. That class was just like an intermediate kind of Vinyasa class. This particular class was good for both beginners and those who want to push their practice. Small lobby and check in area allow for more class space. There was also a little boutique where they sell books, lotions, clothing, Yogi Toes, etc. There is one large room divided in two unequal sides. For the class I took today, we were in the larger side. Sherry gave us a mini tour and showed us the other smaller side. She said when they have speakers, they open up the divider. The large room comfortably housed the 30 or so students. Of all the students today, my bf was the only dude in class. The studio is totally Lilith Fair, vagina friendly. They have spa treatments and womens' seminars and crap. I'd say the ages ranged from 22 to 50-something, the average being 35. The session started with an OM and no invocations. But Sherry was very into philosophy. All this ""open your heart"" kind of stuff. We also did a pranayama (breathing exercise) similar to the ending pranayama in Bikram yoga. She held her asanas (postures or poses) than I'm used to, making for a more strenuous session. She was very accommodating and generous to modifying her practice for all skill levels. I think the girl next to me was a dancer. Bitch. Sherry was also very thorough when it came to properly explaining entering and exiting the postures correctly. She had this large pedestal in the front of the class to stand on, but she was constantly walking around, correcting peoples' form. Everyone seemed to know what they were doing, comfortably moving through Vinyasas. I liked her flow and sequencing of postures. Even Bf, a hardcore Bikram dude enjoyed it. She did a good mix of balancing, strength, and stretching postures. She played some mellow, new age music. The studio was really quiet and serene, with the exception of the ventilation kicking on every now and then. The climate was nice. Not too cold, not to warm. I noticed a lot of people had water bottles by their sides, but I never noticed people drinking from them. I really liked Sherry. I liked the studio space. Its a little expensive, but I think you get what you pay for. * off the strip, non-casino ",0,0,1,0,0

 I went into Five Guys after hearing all of the hype surrounding it. I was very intrigued, and I love how Chick Fil A uses peanut oil to fry everything, so I figured it would be something like a beefy version of Chick Fil A. I ordered a little bacon cheeseburger with bbq sauce, grilled onions, jalapenos, lettuce, tomato alongside some Cajun fries. The burger was delicious. It was really juicy, and I loved how the crust of the meat was very crispy. The cheese was delicious as well. The jalapenos added a nice kick to the burger. The cajun fries were really bad though. They needed some salt, and they needed it badly. Otherwise, they were well seasoned, but I couldn't eat more than a couple of fries without feeling this immense dryness in my mouth. Another pet peeve is that they only have malt vinegar and ketchup for the fries. I tried the malt vinegar with the fries, and I thought it was disgusting. It didn't taste like malt vinegar to me. It tasted more like apple cider vinegar. Since I'm not a ketchup fan, I didn't end up eating a lot of the fries. You could really taste that they were fried in peanut oil by the way. It wasn't a positive or a negative; it was just very prevalent. Overall, I won't be coming back to 5 guys. I'm going to stick to In N Out and Smashburger. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This store is horrible. Every-time we shop at this Walmart there is a problem at the register or somewhere else. The manager doesn't give cashiers the responsibility to correct a small transaction problem at the register. Instead, you have to wait 10-15 minutes for someone to come over with the key, so that they can continue with your transactions. We had a coupon for $.50 that wasn't showing the discount. We had to wait 10 minutes for someone to come over with the key so we could get our discount. When we went out to our car we found about 100 shopping carts lined up behind our car, so we couldn't move. We had purchases that included several frozen items.We also had our 5 month old granddaughter with us who was getting hot and crying.We waited and waited for the cart people to return. They didn't. Finally some other people whose cars were also blocked arrived and were able to push the carts away from blocking our car so we could leave. I blame everything on a very very poor manager. Obviously there is no customer service training at this store. I am ready to travel further from our home to a different Walmart or even to Target, in an effort to get better customer service.

 The best beer selection anywhere. This is the place I originally started learning about new beers from around the world. Before YH was even in Vegas, I was frequenting them in LA. It helped me expand my ""beer horizons"" and now I can't even go back to bud light or anything like that. Surprising was the menu... very diverse and everything is good! They have great happy hour specials as well... such as half off pizzas, seared sashimi ahi tuna and more. It's a comfortable environment with lots of TVs keeping you up on the latest sporting events with classic 80's tunes in the background. A great deal and great atmosphere! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've eaten here twice now. I will continue to do so, as a group goes here Sunday evenings, and I enjoy the night out. But I'd prefer eating elsewhere. For starters, the burgers. I know people who rave about Red Robin burgers...nothing I've had here would set me to raving. The burgers are restaurant burgers; a bit better than McDonald's or similar, but nowhere near what I can do at home, and more costly. Nothing here sets it apart from any other mediocre restaurant style burger place. Of the two times I've eaten here, I once had the burger come pink -extremely- pink (like, 'rare'; I asked for medium. I think it was just rushed out of the kitchen because I ordered later than the rest of my party. If you don't like that, explicitly state 'no pink'), and the other time, there was a misunderstanding what I wanted (I asked for the Royal Red Robin burger, the waitress said ""You mean the cheeseburger?"" I didn't have the menu any more, and didn't remember if it had cheese on it or not, so said ""Uh...I guess?"" Apparently not), which wasn't exactly the restaurants fault, but was still really weird and kinda made it less appealing. That said, neither burger was worth the ~$10 I shelled out for it. I'm just...not enthused. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Being a bit of a 'meat and potatoes' guy, I would usually walk right past a place like Payard when it's time to eat, but as I lapped Caesar's Palace looking for a quick breakfast one recent morning when I was flying solo, Payard definitely fit the bill. While I could have opted for a sit-down experience inside the restaurant, I hit the 'express' line and ordered a buckwheat crepe stuffed with ham, cheddar and egg over easy. So simple and so good. I watched a young woman craft my crepe before my eyes and was soon enjoying it with my morning coffee at a self-service bistro table right in front of the restaurant. Quick, easy, delicious and under $10. Payard, I'll be back...maybe for dessert next time! ",0,0,0,1,0

 One of the best sushi places I've had! Location is a little strange and out of the way but well worth it. Yelpers were spot on with their raving reviews of Goyemon. The inside was very nice and clean and didn't smell :) It was a packed house which is always a good sign of a great establishment. We sat at the sushi bar and Ivan, our sushi chef was amazing. Of course we ordered the AYCE. Loved the fact we can order 1/2 rolls so we could try lots of different items. The nigiri was the perfect bite size. We enjoyed the Hurricane, garlic tuna, masago with quail egg, and I also tried the 911...spicy habanero HELL! We made friends with nearby patrons & started sharing but none of them dared to try the 911. I couldn't feel my face after eating it, thank goodness for the nearby sugar packets to help put out the heat. To finish our meal, lychee sherbet...refreshing and light. Definitely at the top of our list for sushi. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Wow, guy answering calls over phone was about as apathetic as possible for his job and borderline rude (very dismissive and sarcastic at best). Was considering taking them but had a sudden change of heart.. Only reason I don't rate this experience a 1 star is because the rate I was quoted was actually very reasonable. But just can't bring myself to help support even a fraction of this guy's paycheck. We'll see how uber goes for me. Update in response to comment: Look-- Firstly, I gave a fair assessment of your company (based on my own personal experience, as limited as it may have been) and I clearly stated a positive aspect of the experience. So I wasn't just ranting and giving a wildly vicious report of my experience. Your rating on yelp is the sole reason why I called you first. Secondly, providing prompt, friendly service is really not that difficult even when you have rushes, its quite easy to be polite and leaves a positive impression almost always. I will assume that you were the guy I talked to over the phone for the remainder of this. I work somewhere that deals with drunk, rude, oftentimes outright mean people but I don't treat customers (or potentials) before or after those people differently based on the isolated experiences I encounter with those that cause me frustration and occasional anger. So I completely understand the feeling of having to deal with jerks, but its not cool to act like a-hole to someone who IS acting respectfully toward you because other callers may not be. What's annoying to me and really merits a reply to your message is that you are defending and making excuses for the rudeness rather than just apologize for the instance and strive to provide a friendly service that would/could turn someone like myself from a non-customer into a customer. While its nice to have a well established clientele, it would probably be nicer to have a model that considers gaining future customers as well. You basically saying its ok for yourself or your employees to treat non-customers rudely because they haven't done business with you in the past is faulty logic. I doubt you really care to sit here and read what some non-customer thinks so I won't take up anymore time, but I thought I would at least give you my 2 cents, as its the only thing I would give your company at this point.

 So surprised about the quality of this hotel! Stayed at many of the top Vegas hotels and wanted to try Caesars. Based on the price we paid and Caesars reputation, I was expecting to treat myself to luxury. Instead I got a clogged shower, no shower pressure, and $8 coffees with no coffee maker in my room. The rooms need to be updated, felt so old and grungy. I agree with one of the reviews that a Motel 6 would be cleaner. I forgot my makeup remover towelettes and used their washcloth to remove my makeup, ended up getting pink eye! One evening, we requested directions from one of the employees to a restaurant. They gave us the wrong directions, and we wasted over an hour getting back to the right location. When I notified management of the person I spoke to, they said it was not their problem because it wasn't their employee, but a person who rented space from them. Super long check in line, and a couple people just cut in front of me. When I asked about this, I was just brushed off. Obviously they have severe plumbing problems based on reviews I see as I'm writing this one. When I complained about the clogged shower and lack of water pressure, their response of course was: ""We've never had a complaint like that before"" Won't be going back there for sure! ",1,0,0,0,0

 If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese in Scottsdale, then don't go here. But if you're craving general Asian flavors and don't mind a touch of grease in your food, then Noodles Ranch may do in a pinch. The banh xeo (Vietnamese crepe) came across more thin omelet than crisp crepe. While the filling of pork and shrimp were quite generous, the flavors were much more Chinese than Vietnamese. The catfish dish tasted pan fried (with a generous splash of oil) despite the menu description of ""grilled."" Heavy use of turmeric also made it taste vaguely Indian. Overall, not a bad pan-Asian food place, but the flavors just didn't fulfill my craving for Vietnamese. Next time, I'll take the drive to Da Vang. ",0,0,1,0,0

 There used to be an Earl close to where I lived in Michigan.. but one day when I went for my favorite tuna melt in the world, it was gone, just like that. And since that day some 2 years ago, I have been pretty down. But then, while tipsily walking through Planet Hollywood, I saw it. I saw the shrine of all things holy.... EARL OF SANDWICH! The friends I was with walked in unassumingly, not that interested, and refusing to believe my ranting. But then again, my mouth may have been watering so much that I may not have been speaking properly. Once we all go out sandwiches though-- they became believers. The Earl makes a damn good sandwich. This place goes way beyond all other chain sandwich shops in the country, I can't wait for the day that The Earl conquers all. It is rightfully deserved. Trust me, if you want a sandwich. Go here.

 This was our first time at Forte. Initially we were a bit concerned about the food considering the interior design of the place. However, the food was definantly good, the spices were unique and not bland. The interior decor grows on you as you sit back and look at all the newspaper and media clippings on the wall...feels authentic and almost makes you feel like your in another time and place. Service was good when we got service...however, i was surprised that they had one individual working the front (serving, ordering, hosting guests)...this caused some interesting service experience.

 I'm not from Madison, so I decided to eat at Mediterranean Cafe after reading some of the reviews. I ordered the lamb shawarma plate which comes with lamb, rice, salad, hummus and warm sliced pita bread. For my drink, I ordered the Arabic tea which I thought was good, but a little too sugary for my taste. My meal was a little over $8, so it was cheap and pretty good. The employees were pretty nice too. I thought they could have given additional pita bread with the meal (came with 5 or 6 small pieces). The tea was good but way too sweet for me. They don't accept credit cards (cash or check only) and the place was pretty small, so be aware if you have a larger group. A group of 4 or less would work for this cafe. Overall, I liked this place. This would be a good place to eat for a quick lunch when you don't want the normal fast food joints around the area. ",0,0,0,1,0

 For a city with a sizable Indian population, Pittsburgh's Indian restaurant scene can be pretty hit or miss. After reading a very good review of Mintt in the City Paper, I decided to give it a go. After missing it on the first pass (look for the red awning of a Verizon store), Belle and I settled in to what seems to be a converted garage--keep that in mind for winter months if you have thin skin. It's still a new place and the decor is pretty minimal. Being a converted space, the place has a slight cavernous feel to if there aren't too many other diners there, but that changes considerably once the place fills up, but not a romantic first date kind of place. The menu itself is pretty extensive, which is both a blessing and a curse. I'm always a little suspect of places that have massive menus since I generally don't trust that the cook has THAT many knock out recipes in his/her repertoire. Still, the menu was a good mix of expected dishes and relatively obscure ones. We started out with Chicken 55, a fried chicken appetizer that's a take on street food. Very good--the chicken was moist without being greasy and nicely spiced. I ordered biryani and Belle ordered lamb curry. She said ""6"" when asked how spicy she wanted her curry. My biryani was fantastic--fragrant, flavorful, whatever you may be looking for in a biryani was in it. The curry was pretty bland. Others have commented on how spicy food at Mintt is, so I'm wondering if you actually have to say you want it spicy to get it spicy--otherwise you get the ""adjusted for the Pittsburgh palate"" level of spice. Still, an excellent meal. Service was good, although I noticed that once the place filled up, the newer tables experienced slight delays (although nothing I would consider egregious). ",0,0,1,0,0

 WING NIGHT ~ Wahoo!!! I did not used to be much of a wing fan, however that has changed over the last couple years. Now I very much enjoy good wings. Native New Yorker has a great Salt and Pepper dry rub that I am obsessed with. The wings are good sized, crispy, flavorful and not greasy (or) to messy. There is a hint of garlic on the Salt and Pepper wings that makes them just that much better. If you go for Tuesday night .35 cent wings just be prepared to wait for a table, it gets a little crazy trying to find a place to sit. But for the price and the quality it is worth it! (Their Medium sauce is good, it has a little kick but it does not burn your mouth. So if you like sauce on your wings but don't like to sweat then go with the medium.) ",0,0,0,1,0

 When you're here, you're ignored. A friend and I decided to dine at the bar seating area for the soup/salad/breadsticks special for a late lunch, but what should have been a simple routine order turned into a train wreck that evolved into the last time I eat at OG. They had employees (including what appeared to be a manager) wandering aimlessly like malfunctioning roomba vacuums, several tables were left un-bussed for almost an hour, and a complete lack of service even at the basic level left us mind boggled. We watched a couple looking around, waiting for a server, but they did what we should have and walked out after several minutes. Despite knowing what we wanted before we arrived, our order wasn't taken until over a half hour after walking through the door. The salad was under dressed, the breadsticks salty, the soup was fine although the lack of service left a poor taste in our mouths throughout the entire meal. Our server disappeared more often than David Copperfield so locating someone to get a check took several minutes after finishing. The manager finally came over and presented the check but then the train derailed. We immediately put two cards down to pay and waited, and waited, and waited. We looked around, made comments, contemplated just leaving. Nobody wanted to take our money. Finally, 15 minutes later our server reappeared from her disappearing act to run our cards we requested to be split. Obviously too difficult of a task as the entire bill was charged to one card. I regret leaving any tip at all, but the biggest tip I can leave is avoid this place and find a nice local family restaurant that will appreciate your business. There are plenty of eateries out there that will make you feel like family. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Best ""Happy Hour"" in Vegas. The specials they run for HH from half price appetizers (nachos my favorite either get in chicken or beef) and all domestic or import beers 2 for 1.

Lot of good micro brews from the US and always seem like new one added when I go. The prices are very reasonable. The food always good. I tend too get the sandwiches or burgers. Every time the sandwiches nice hot, fresh, and french fries good. My favorite is the reuben sandwich! I love the thousand island sauce. The whole combination the pastrami really could eat by itself. The bar area is great they have lots of televisions too watch the games on. It one if not the only place that get the NHL package. I love NHL and hockey one biggest passions in life.

 Over the years I've been to Don & Charlie's MANY times. It's once of my Dad's favorites, which is exactly why, when tasked with arranging a birthday celebration for him, I chose Don & Charlies. The food here is solid. I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, but it is satisfying every time I am here. The best part of this place, in my opinion, is the service and the ambiance. This is truly a ""guys place,"" filled with sports memorabilia... a guys dream. Wherever you sit, just above your head could be a picture of your favorite athlete, from any sport... that's pretty cool. This past time we were here, the food was spot on as always for our party of seven. Everyone enjoyed their LARGE portions and tasty choices. Our server was AWESOME... he even made a connection with my sister for his upcoming move out to LA. His attention to detail and cheerful, fun attitude surly made the night that much more special.

 I came here yesterday and had great service. Sandwich was great. Service was fast. But today I came here again and when I got to my car I noticed that there was no cheese in my sandwich so I went inside and asked for a couple piece to put on it. Max, a short Hispanic male worker, was at the register and started asking me for my order details then my ticket number. He started pushing buttons on the register for about four minutes, making a few pieces of cheese a huge deal. When another customer came in he told me to step aside and he will have to keep looking for my ticket so he can charge me for the cheese. I told him to just charge me then. He was very rude with every word that came out of his mouth. There were several other employees there that told him to just hit the cheese button at which point he snapped at them and said, ""don't argue with me!"" I couldn't believe the disrespect, to me the customer and to his coworkers. This guy has no business being in customer service. He should be moved to the back to wash dishes if he can't handle being polite. After he snapped at the coworker, another one put two pieces of cheese in a sleeve and gave it to me. She said she was just going to pay for it. I gave I've star for this restaurant based on Max. If he gets removed from here then I will review my rating. ",1,0,0,0,0

 What a magnificent restaurant! After four exceptional visits, I decided it was time to show some love. The food is a knockout, the service is always friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is pitch-perfect. I always feel like I'm at a great dinner party in the fabulous home of a great local chef. Let's talk food: 1. Cheese Curds - Basically the best fried things ever. At $5, just get them and laugh at the idiots eating something by the same name at Culver's. 2. Brussel Sprouts - I can't remember the exact description, but they were crazy good. My boyfriend and I actually had to bargain for the last spoonful. 3. Stuffed Medjool Dates - That perfect melding of sweet/rich/spicy/salty. I wanted more, but I maintained my composure because the entree arrived as we ran out. 4. Pork Tenderloin - This was perfection. Tender/perfectlycooked/juicy/flavorful/gorgeous grilled tenderloin. I thought I'd had great pork, but I was sorely mistaken. The sweetness from the date butter was just unbelievable. I've had my share of pork with some sort of apple concoction. That's all fine and good, but nothing has ever come close to this. I can't wait to go back to have this dish again. 5. Chicken & Waffles - The ultra-crunchy breading on the most perfectly cooked piece of chicken ever. As a boy from Kentucky, I can't say that this was the best fried chicken of my life, but it absolutely ranked among the greats. (Actually, I might give the crown to Arrogant Butcher on their fried chicken night). The white cheddar waffle is unlike anything I've had. Crazy addictive and strange. Highly recommended 6. Ribs Special - So here is where I felt that I could have passed. They were very good ribs, but they weren't in the realm of Earth-shattering. Although, I am unfairly comparing them to the best joints in Memphis. 7. Bread Pudding - silent weeping with one hand raised to the heavens. Praise. 8. Beet Chip Spinach Salad - What fun! Just loved the balance flavors and textures. Great salad to get for the table and share. The thing about Tuck Shop is that they take a food that you think you know, and they make it better than you thought it could ever be. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Ok, if you want a huge pool with thousands of people, don't come here. If you want small, intimate, VIP, with good looking people, I'd recommend you stop by. However, if you don't want to shell out for a private bed or cabana, you better get there early! If you're lucky, you won't pay a cover, which we didn't. Not sure how much you'd have to pay for admission normally. The DJ was awesome, the people were friendly, and everyone is just after a good time. Dancing by the pool, people getting pretty drunk, people mingling. The waitstaff is gorgeous and the security guards are pretty hot, too! Definitely some great eye candy. There are some free lounge chairs if you get there early enough, and they have really comfortable chair covers. They provide you with big, fluffy white towels. We rented a bed around the pool for $200. So worth if for the whole day. The staff is super attentive. We rarely waited for refills. I didn't try the food, but it looked good! I grew up in Miami, so I appreciate a good pool scene. This was everything I could have wanted...a giant party out by the pool with awesome people, good (and strong) drinks, and attractive people. The best way to meet new people is when you are in a smaller crowd, which is why I like the fact that Tao Beach isn't too expansive. I spent two full days by the pool and miss it already!!

 My Great Eggspectations were dashed by going to this huge LETDOWN of a restaurant. First of all, the dining area upstairs in about 15 degrees warmer than downstairs which makes it blisteringly hot up there. The chairs in the restaurant are iron or something similarly painful to sit upon. You cannot get comfortable in these seats! My husband ordered the french toast Flambe (Eggcitement).. awful. overly sweet and syrupy and flambeed in the kitchen. I had the waffle with strawberries with unripe strawberries. If the strawberries are out of season, why are you serving them? We had a couple over easy eggs on the side and our bill was well over $30. Plus the bathrooms are dirty with a big ""D"".

I got the lamb plate it was not memorable. Flavors are just ok a little bland on the spices for my taste. I would say the same about the hummus. Too chain for me. Then as our check arrived we were told it could only be split 6 ways no matter what. This would have been helpful to know before I ordered. So you see this is a gracious 3 Starer.

 I moved into the Madison area just last week, and after hearing rumors about the spectacular lunch buffet at the Maharaja, I needed to try it for myself. Suffice it to say that I was in no way disappointed. I showed up to the restaurant at 2:55 this afternoon, with an entire 5 minutes to spare before the buffet officially closed. Even so, the hot food was still hot, the cold food cold, and absolutely everything was extraordinarily delicious (and I would know - of course I had to try a bit of it all). The waiters themselves were very polite and attentive, which I generally do not expect at anything that even resembles a buffet - not to mention when someone shows up 5 minutes before the meal *should* be over. All in all, this experience alone was enough to inspire delight in my new Wisconsin home. I look forward to finding the many other edible treasures that Madison surely has to offer, but I will most certainly be passing up more than a few meal opportunities to come back to this wonderful downtown diner. - The New Madisonian P.S. They've also got free wireless. Oh yeah. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Worst. Coffee-related. Experience. Ever. I will say, the beverages were pretty good, not awe-inspiring but good. But the service sucked. It was my first time there and I wasn't sure what I wanted but had been sent with drink orders from some friends. It started poorly. I stood at the counter for several minutes without a single person either before or after me and was not so much as greeted. I've worked in a cafe and that should just not ever happen. If they can greet you over the heads of 30 travelers at an airport Starbucks, I should at least be able to get a hello at a desolate cafe. Second, there was no tea on their menu so I finally asked the dude behind the counter about ordering I asked him about a tea order for my compadre. He looked at a paper behind the register, told me what I was looking for existed and rang me up for it. I guess my biggest complaint is the tone of condescension that was present from the time I opened the door to the time I left. Even the 4 middle-aged patrons looked at me like I wasn't trendy enough to be there. I may not have a snazzy haircut or be walking in with a fancy mac book but I am still intelligent enough to pick up on attitude and, as far as I know, my money is just as good as anyone else's. I will absolutely never go to this location again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Unfortunately, I was not all that impressed with Bernie's. It's a shame it's the only real photography store in the city, but they could definitley do better. As part of a black and white photography class, I needed to pick up film and photo paper, among a few other things. While Bernie's had everything I needed (and lots of other supplies) I didn't feel all that appreciated for coming in. I spent a couple hundred bucks and felt like I was being shuffled out the door as quickly as possible. I will give the one guy at the counter some credit because a woman right before me asked to get a roll or two of film developed in just barely an hour. I could tell he wanted to get to it quickly, but still felt like I was hassling the guy just being there. I hate to see real camera stores shut down, but unless I'm in a pinch I'm probably going to order supplies online from now on. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My girlfriend and I wanted a cheap, family style Mexican dinner off strip, without breaking the bank. Casa Don Juan delivered it! If you don't get the carnitas platter, you're crazy! Tender, succulent braised pork with delicious homemade tortillas, pico, roasted jalapenos, and fresh guac. Every bite was heaven. If I lived in Vegas, I'd eat this every week. The margs were great--healthy mix of fresh juice, mix and tequila. They went down easy and were reasonably priced. In Vegas that's under 10 bucks! We went back for breakfast. And I'd give them 4 stars for it. Potato burrito was tasty and she had potato tacos with eggs. Taters a little under done. Would like it spicier next time. ",0,0,0,0,1

 With competition at a bare zero, Pho Avina provides that quick pho fix that is almost as necessary as heroin is to an addict. The soup definitely has some characteristics but ultimately lacks any oomph. The meat portions are on the chintzy side and the spring rolls are a pass. The service is above standard and there definitely is a family feel. Is it worth visiting? Carbon footprint-wise absolutely. But is it really enough to merely alleviate that craving or does it need to blow you away like it was your first time every time? ",0,0,1,0,0

 I heard this place was on one of the Food Network shows and I was expecting a busy place that doesn't live up to the hype - not the case at all.

 I stopped in on the grand opening day (11/6/2010) for a ""fitness evaluation"". Both my husband and I ended up having a personal training session with one of the coordinators of the personal training program. He was a straight shooter who basically tells you what he thinks. If you are out of shape and are in denial about it, he will tell you what you should try to fix. I will say it was a very good session and I am still sore today (11/8/2010). I ended up signing up for a 12 month twice per week personal training commitment. It is pricey but my husband can come with me for the same price so that we are both getting healthier.

 I've always thought of Zia records as so-so but was never too fond of the customer service. I have come along a few employees that were friendly but most of them are big-headed and arrogant. Yesterday I went to this location and was literally shooed out by a very ill-mannered girl with short, blonde hair. Under the circumstances I understand she was doing her job but she was VERY rude about it while I did nothing to disrespect her in anyway whatsoever. She decided to be EXTREMELY disrespectful to me over something that I did not do. Working in retail I know that I would personally NEVER EVER treat a customer the way she treating me regardless of what the circumstances were. I have never experienced such rude manner from an employee before and I hope that I never have to again. Needless to say, there is a handful of record stores around the valley with cheaper selection and friendly, helpful customer service. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of Taco Guild for months. I drive and walk by frequently since I'm a nearby Cheery Lynn Historic neighborhood resident. I checked out the menu online before they opened their doors and could hardly wait to taste each of the deliciously described taco creations. So tonight we were excited to finally get to check it out. The very first thing I noticed when we walked through the doors was how freaking LOUD it was!! Like really loud!!! The music is blasting right over your head and my husband and I felt like we had to yell to each other over the 2 feet of table between us. It is a big open space with concrete floors so not a lot to absorb the sound but the music needs to be kicked down several notches. I have been to places where I think to myself it is too loud (and I watch movies and t.v. with subtitles because I can't hear all that well) but for this reason alone, I could not wait to get out of there. It stressed me out the whole time... so uncomfortable. The tacos on the other hand were pretty yummy! It is not on the menu for some reason, but our very nice waiter told us that you can do a three taco platter that comes with a side (the menu only has everything a la carte). It was my husband, myself and our six year old son. We got two platters, so six tacos and two sides for us all to split. We did the Al Pastor Pork (delish), Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef (the only thing our kid could eat since everything else was on the spicy side and there's no options for kids), Guild Chicken (my third favorite), Yucatan Shrimp (good, but my least fave), Thai Snapper (my second favorite - so good!) and the Peking Duck (my favorite - surprising flavors - very creative!!) The sides were pretty bland. The descriptions on the menu make them sound so good. I was disappointed in the Grilled Corn ""off"" the Cob and the Green Chile Achiote Rice. I just wished they lived up to my expectations and were more flavorful. Another thing is I realize with the loud music and the bar that they are not necessarily catering to families with kids, but there should be something kid-friendly on the menu at any restaurant. A chicken and cheese quesadilla or bean and cheese burrito or something. Take it from St. Francis and Postino's: both more adult settings, but have kid friendly options on their menus. We eat out A LOT and pretty much always have the kid with us. We don't want to have to get a babysitter just because we want to have good food in a fun atmosphere. Since it is just down the street and we love to support local owned business we will most definitely come back and give it another chance. Like to try some guacamole since I saw the people that sat at the table next to us order it and it looked delicious. I also want to try the Grilled Romaine Salad since the pic on the website looks amazing. I've reread my review and I hate that I sound so negative. I'd like to think they are just getting into their groove and it will only improve with a little feedback. I want to see them do well since I think it is a great addition to the neighborhood!

 So I walked in here looking for a place to do some work on my laptop and have some coffee. 'Lo and behold this place is setup more for a lunch type crowd, but I sit down and order an espresso. There is no publicly available wifi here, and the espresso was HORRIBLE. I'm fairly sure they use that pop-a-canister into a machine type espresso instead of real coffee beans. I receive the check and it's around $5.00 for one double espresso. I don't think I've ever paid that much in the states, but I digress. I tried to pay my bill with card since I only had a little cash on me and I wanted to tip my initial waiter since he was pretty attentive/nice. The (I think) manager came by, told me in a very condescending tone that I had to spend at least $10.00 to use card and left. I threw down a $5.00 and left this place. If you're looking for a great cafe with good coffee, food, and people check out Baguette Cafe instead. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We were excited when we heard O'Shea's was coming back so we made a point to visit it new at the Linq. Well, everything was all fine and dandy until we met this one bartender. We visited in May and just recently in June. In may we came in for some shots as a group and met this bartender that initially seemed great...bonded with the group...provided water...so far so good right? Wrong. When we get our bills we find that he overcharged us for our shots. When we pointed it out he was like ""Oh Crap, my bad, I'll have to call the manager to reverse this but it might take a while."" Then he asks us if we would rather just have another round of shots to make it even and forgo the hassle....okay fine we ordered another shot each. Unfortunately when he gave us the shots it was not what we ordered, it was a cheaper shot and he said ""Well these are better anyways"" Ummmm pretty sure you just charged us for a more expensive shot and gave us the cheapest one you have....We left feeling scammed. Okay, so we try it again in June for my husbands birthday. More shots. Lo and Behold we get the SAME bartender and this time I wanted to see if he would do the same schpeal. Sure enough when he brought my sister in law's change back he was like ""oh! my bad I over charged you...too late now right"" at this point we were like um no she wants her change. He then says okay well i'll have to call the manager and it could definitely be a while. When I mentioned that we had been there a month before, suddenly, he comes back with her change saying that he ""would just eat the difference"" Trying to make us feel bad ...hmmmmm....yes you will buddy cuz you are scamming people. At this point we asked for a manager to let them know. Not sure if some of the other bartenders were in on it or not. The managers did listen to us and will hopefully fire this one bartender as he is scamming people. They also offered us a couple free rounds of drinks each for our trouble. Over all we MIGHT come back to O'sheas because the managers were nice and helpful but if we see that bartender again...NO WAY. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The title on the front: ""Healthy Kitchen"", that alone should be the warning. If a business has to advertise that, they are trying too hard. Maybe we have high standards because we are from California where we know what good, clean Vegan food actually is. When we walked in the manager/server (?) jumped up and said ""Hello, Welcome"", then went back to leaning over the front counter with his phone in his face. Everything seemed okay while ordering at the counter. The realization that I was in a gross place started when I went to pour water. Tap water from the Coke machine. What ""health"" oriented business has anything to do with the Coca-Cola company (FYI: corrupt evil corporation). Any truly healthful food restaurant knows what clean/pure water is. Not this place. When my Veggie Burger arrived the GF bun was SO DRY and starchy it was like eating stale duck feed. And it's not just my bun, my husband had a standard wheat bun with his veggie burger. I went to the sidebar to check out the condiments like ketchup and mustard: SYSCO. If the basic condiments are SYSCO with high fructose corn syrup, just imagine the rest of the ingredients in the kitchen, and their source. Some of the reviews here say ""I'm glad they use high-quality ingredients"", that is not possible if their main supplier is SYSCO. We asked for another ketchup or condiment option that did not have High Fructose Corn Syrup from the server/mangaer. He said that was all they had. Lame. The Veggie patty was bland beans. The Tofu ""fries"" were so fried there was no tofu left in the middle, shriveled and soaking in oil. Gross. The Thai ginger soup I got was like a think gloppy pudding. I tried putting it on my burger like a condiment to make it more edible. Didn't help. My son got the GF Veggie pizza, the only thing flavorful on the table, because it was drenched in oil. If you have HEALTH standards, are Vegan or Gluten-Free, I would NOT recommend this place. It is a cheap chain, with rip-off prices. Unfortunately, we left half of our food on the plate uneaten, walked out highly disappointed and feeling sick and gross from the quality of food. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I took my 2 year old son here for lunch today. Ordered him a cheeseburger. When they brought his burger to our table, the cheese seemed to have been missing. I let the server know, she took his burger and said she'd get some cheese melted on it. Well, she brought his burger back with a thick, cold, unmelted slice of cheese on it. Did she really think this was acceptable? Apparently so, since she brought my bill shortly after. Mind you, I am also currently 36 weeks pregnant and super emotional right now. I wished I were able to pull it together to actually let her and the manager know about it. Unfortunately, I ended up giving my son my meal, paying my bill and going out to my car to cry!

 OMG please do not stay here if you dont have too. My friends and i went to montreal for a Spanish festival and she booked the hotel. Being in the hotel industry in the past I have high expectations. This place was a huge dump. I was scared I was going to catch something for sure!! The bed was low to the ground, the place was dirty and the decore was so wrong on so many levels. There was a chandalere hanging in the center of the room so low you could hit it when you sat up on the bed. The celing was covered with droopy white sheets with brown huge stains. I was so happy we were only staying there for one night!! The room key was an actual key with a huge piece of wood attached to it.

 Oh my god, a mouthgasm waiting to happen. Order the lamb confit. Do it. Ignore the kebabs, you can find a decent one everywhere. Don't get me wrong, the shish touk was fantastic, but the lamb is where it's at. I have not seen anything like it on any other menu and I doubt I'll find or taste anything like that anytime soon. You don't see many middle eastern fine dining establishments overall so you might be asking why you'd pay 2-3x the price for middle eastern food but the lamb will make it worth it. Your mouth will thank you. You will drool every time you browse past the Instagram photo of your spectacular lamb shank. I wish we skipped the shish touk and went for another lamb dish or that amazing looking pomegranate salad they have going on. These entrees are enormous by the way, meant for sharing. You'd enjoy yourself much better if you were in a group. The apricot cocktail was out of this world (who knew pistachios would work in a cocktail?) Now to gripe- service is spotty. The servers are courteous, seat you promptly, and get your food out on time but we were essentially abandoned to almost the end of service. Usually I don't care about that but my SO didn't get a fork in his place setting. When we tried to wave the server over he gave the ""one minute"" gesture and took about 10-15 minutes closing other tabs and getting orders in that by the time he came by our table to hear our inquiry, we were almost done eating using one fork passed back and forth (totally not classy but the food was getting cold and I was not able to spoil this amazing dish with this mishap!)

 They came to my house the same day that I called which was a pleasant surprise. I'm glad that I didn't have to wait a week for them to fix our fuse box. With labor at $65 per hour it's pretty affordable depending on what you want them to do. Be aware that there might be two guys coming out to you though- so it'll be $65 per hour x2. ",0,0,0,1,0

 YUM-ME Me and a buddy decided to explore downtown on a Wednesday Night. I read some really great reviews about this place and it did not disappoint. We walked in to a large hallway shared by several businesses where the hostess stand was located. We asked for a table. The hostess made a pouty face and explained they were booked but we could sit and eat at the bar if we would like. My adventure begun. My buddy who has lost a ton of weight was on a strict diet of salmon. See review Yelp Review about anyone (actually the Yelper's Date) ordering salmon. I decided if he was going to order salmon - I would have to increase the ""manly"" portion at the bar - I ordered the large bone in ribeye (the one that feeds 2). I was not really hungry but I knew I would have some awesome leftovers and make my buddy regret any diet he was putting himself thru. My meal was right out of a Fred Flinstone cartoon... it was served on a large cutting board over quartered potatoes topped with a femur with fresh Bone Marrow butter. I ordered an appetizer as well of the bone marrow - I always see the chefs (see Travel Channel, Food Network) order bone marrow and spread it on toast. It is a meat flavored butter. He said his meal was really good. My meal was far superior. Overall reivew: Atmosphere - very trendy - very crowded and next to a Cabaret Place - which would be very cool to have dinner then catch a show if I was on a date. Prices - This place is not bad considering. Meals were about $85 but really we ordered 3 meals (the Steak was really for 2 people) + Appetizer. You can get pricey alcohol as well - I recommend Porkslap Beer and bourbon :-) - they have a unique 12 year - very good Service - We sat at the bar - our bartender was great. A very high recommend and a good stop if you are traveling and find yourself in Downtown Pittsburgh! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Didn't try the the hot dog cuz there was a ""Willy Wueben"" on the menu. It was darn good! Had a unique, homemade thousand island dressing and Dublin cheese--yu-um! So nice to have a cold Dad's Cream Soda out of the fridge with it! The place has a warm, kitschy feel with all the Steelers paraphernalia but don't let that scare you! ;) Very friendly staff.

 I have been coming to this Petco for 2 years.... The only thing good about this place is the store manager but even as nice as she was.... it didnt make up for what happened. I took my dog in to get groomed. They were understaffed (which nobody told me about when I dropped him of for his appointment.) so I had to wait longer. Nobody told me it was going to be 2 hours longer than what I was told so I tried to be patient. Waited. Waited... I was ignore.....would have been nice if someone had given me an estimated wait time.... then again...they had the first time and look how that worked out. But I was still keeping my cool. Hey...things happen. Then a man walks in with 2 dogs... didnt have an appointment and asks to get both his dogs a nail trim. NO PROBLEM!! That's what they say. So my dog and I are waiting for a total of 5 hours to be taken care of and this guy just walks in and is helped right away. Understaffed. That why I had to wait so long. More like...not a priority. Thanks a lot. OH...BUT IM NOT DONE YET..... I took him to my work to show everyone the new ""do"" and when he rolled over..his undercarrage was wayyyy uneven. Nobody can really see it so I'm like...whatever today sucked I'm not going to worry about it... and then everyone asks why his tail is so uneven...and then my friend is petting his fur around the neck and asks why he has a dreadlock. For real guys?? You didn't even brush him out?? I use to tell everyone how great this place was. Sadly, I wont be back ",1,0,0,0,0

 Overall: This is one of the best restaurants I have ever visited in my life. It blew my expectations on tapas and every dish was impeccably seasoned, as if I could feel the effort placed in the design of each dish. Ambience/Service: Being inside the trendy Aria, the restaurant feels hip. The service was impeccable, probably because we were one of the first customers in an early lunch time. Food: I have never been a fan of Spanish Tapas in America, because my general view is that they are very overpriced for only a small amount of food. This restaurant changed my opinion of this cuisine. It was a very memorable experience. The best dish, in my opinion, was the seasoned Black Rice, which was a party in my mouth. I still can't fathom what kind of seasoning went into the dish, but it was just amazing and each bite oozed with umami. The Raspberry Tuna skewers were a pleasant surprise, especially when I found out they dabbed a bit of wasabi paste inside the raspberries. The wasabi really cuts the sourness of the raspberry - it is now my favorite way to eat these berries! I also tried the Spanish Tortilla: creamy potatoes, melt-in-your-mouth onions, all blended in so well with the soft omelette. It's exactly as homey as how my Spanish co-workers made it. I also tried the White Fish Ceviche, which was extremely flavorful with just the right amount of spicy kick. Overall, this place is simply amazing and I would visit it every time I come to Las Vegas.

 I was very disappointed today. I walked in inquiring about the Obama Spiderman issue. I was told they sold out. I wanted to know how many copies they had because other stores of similar size in the valley usually get similar volume. Instead of giving me a straight answer, they tried to pawn off the second printing. I told them I was only interested in the first printing because I'm a colletor. Apparently they thought I was some moron off the street that didn't have any money so they tried to convince me to buy the second printing and convince me that it was going to be a collectors item. They were trying to get me to preorder it. Anyway, I hate these shady sales tactics. I usually shop at All About Books and Comics but Atomic is closer to my house so sometimes I will pop in there. Now I know why I avoid this place. They have nice t-shirts but otherwise, I avoid this place. Furthermore, their comics are not always kept in the best condition and many of their issues are wrinkled. They also filter their comics before placing them on the wrack to covet the ones in the best condition. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Oh Moon. You could be so great, but you lack a lot of the pizzazz that your Vegas club-siblings possess. Like size, style and oh, I don't know, non-skeevy people? After a rough night at Pure, we decided to check out Sunday night at Moon. I walked in and thought, ""Eh. I've seen better."" I was surprised to Moon was so small! The dance floor is pitifully tiny. Most definitely not enough space to accommodate a Vegas-sized crowd. With only 2 bars and a handful of bottle service tables, Moon didn't strike me as a very high-class establishment. Because Moon is located at the top of the Palms' Fantasy Tower, the entire roof opens up so club-goers get a burst of fresh air throughout the night. Good in theory, but because the 2nd floor of the club is VIP-only, the regular folks get the poor-man's view. Boo-hiss! I also had an issue with the music. It was SO gangster. I'm a hip-hop fan, too, but honestly, this was pretty hardcore. It didn't have a great beat, was hard to dance to (especially when you've landed a cute Navy cop!) and didn't exactly have the crowd going crazy. When the DJ switched to Tupac and Snoop, things took a turn for the better! Finally, the clientele isn't the greatest. Maybe because the Palms is off the strip, or maybe because the Real World filmed there however many years ago, but something is kind of tragic about the folks that hang out here. It's like being in a suburban club when you live in the city... Or maybe I'm just snobby. =) ",0,1,0,0,0

 Overpriced wanna be Mexican food. Never again! First and last visit. Tasteless overpriced food. I guess.my famiIy prefers authentic and this is not that. If you enjoy Americanized flavorless food, this place may be for you. They had a guy making ballon animals and he kept making eye contact with my children yet never made his way to our table. For aSaturday evening we were seated rather quickly and the place was crowded. Seating way too tight. Felt we were dining with the group next to us Food bland no seasoning. Chips stale and cold with meh salsa. Margarita was good tho, only good thing about that visit Rather hit up Raul and Theresas ",0,1,0,0,0

 Does another Memorial Day have to be another drive to the coast or the mountains? Do we really have to, yet again, find an ocean side city or a bay to to enjoy an urban weekend? I struggled for weeks because I just couldn't deal with driving 10 miles an hour in a 45 or 55 MPH zone behind cyclists riding three across on a state highway. I couldn't imagine trying to enjoy a walk while bicycles fly by me at 20 MPH. What to do? I've always been contemptuous of Las Vegas, But I'm also sick of coming home after a weekend away more stressed than when I left because of speeding up and slowing down for bicycles, rounding a curve and slamming on my brakes for cyclists riding two or three across, and getting flipped off half the time. I opened my mind and accepted the Venetian as an alternative. After several visits for conferences or meetings, I knew that the canal was a pleasant place to enjoy a walk and stop for dinner, so I took the plunge and did something different. It was the best move I've ever made. After just an evening I realized just how much having to dealing with bicycles everywhere else degrades the experience and the general quality of life. Yes, Las Vegas is a manufactured environment, but it's a GOOD manufactured environment. For the first time in a long time I feel completely relaxed after a weekend away. ",0,0,0,1,0

 First off, thanks to Jerad, back from sabbatical, for his animated service last night. Lesson learned? Don't ask questions, unless you really want to hear the answer. But, his enthusiasm was infectious and cute. Even better, he was a great server in the way he was friendly, attentive, respectful and charming. Nicely done. He had us laughing most of the evening, which was a welcome relief from the woes of Monday. My friend and I hit this place up for their happy hour. I hadn't been in a while, so it was a no-brainer. Zen 32 is a sure-bet to me. I'm always going to find something on the menu I like, and I'm usually going to walk away very satisfied. It's not the most amazing sushi i've had, but it's predictable in the sense that it'll hit the spot every single time, no matter what I choose to try. I ordered the salmon sashimi, veggie roll and yellow tail w/ scallion roll. They were very, very good. The yellowtail w/ scallion is a new fave. For sure. To wash it down, I had their Belgian White Ale. Tasty. I gotta say, their happy hour prices are incredible. $3 per roll or sashimi order; $2 edamama; $1 off draft beer. I'm pleased to say I can come here and stuff my face without emptying my bank account. Plus, the HH menu is pretty diverse, too. From spicy to simple, you got options. So, Zen 32, you're still a top favorite of mine. Anytime anyone suggests coming here, the answer is simple: yes! Their service, selection and sushi are tried-and-true. And that's all that matters to me. Mmmm. ",0,0,0,1,0

 First of all, this is the ONLY location that's close by!!! This wasn't my first time. I've never been so insulted, or felt UN-WELCOMED EVER! I won't be back again. The only reason we gave this location two tries was, I had to use my $16 Groupon!! I should of known from the start the staff was HORRIBLE. I was the one who was trying to be polite. I agree with Emily's review completely. They couldn't be bothered to fake a smile! I wish I grabbed this young kid's name working tonight. FIRST of all, I picked up a meatball marinara COMBO. He was rude to my Mother at check out. Then when we ate, I was going to give a simple yelp review for like 3 stars. The food was GOOD but the people working tonight were miserable. You can see it on their faces. My mother had opened her bag of ruffles & told me to try them. I liked those more than the Sun chips. I put the sun chips back, the female employee was right there. She watched me switch them out. We're about to leave, as I grab a refill. The young guy behind the counter's like ""You gotta pay for that!!"". I came back in, told him ""What are you talking about? I just switched the bags, I hadn't opened it."" He said ""Oh our regular costumers come in and open bags & grab new ones."" Well it was just really insulting to me, he doesn't know me. I know granted I was wearing casual clothing, but I DO NOT steal. SIMPLE. He really pissed me off. No apology, fine I'll take my money to Firehouse Subs. I hope they're happy that they drive business away. I walked in there at quarter of 6 & the place was EMPTY, as if that wasn't a big enough red flag. I won't be shocked if they're closed in a few months. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Very late review, but here it is! I got married in May of this year in Cabo San Lucas, MX. Since lots of family couldn't come, we had a reception here in Phoenix.... At Astor House... In the backyard. It was awesome! Johnathan helped us out the whole way through: giving us menu ideas, prices, tips and ideas, etc. I don't like BBQ as I am a vegetarian so they made us our own menu for the occasion. Although I didn't get to eat much food, everything I did try was amazing! I would definitely go back since we even live in the neighborhood other than I never know when they are open. They have very strange hours so you can't just walk in and expect the door to be unlocked. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is a very cool park with tons of amenities from the rec center (haven't been inside) picnic areas, trails, playgrounds, splash area, skate park, the works. I am going to focus this on the multi use trails. Heading to the south the trail goes down to Grand Ave where it loops around to the west side and heads north just past Bell Rd. This loop is about 9 miles and with the underpasses is completely free of car traffic. Along the trail are a few rest areas that have benches, one of the rest spots has a pavilion and water fountain. When you take the trail north of the park, it loops past the Peoria Sports Complex, hooks up with Thunderbird Paseo Park and meanders southeast and connects to the canal trail. I have taken this down to Central Ave. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ovarium seemed so mysterious, I'd been dying to go for more than a year now. Well, thanks to a trusty Groupon, the mystery is no more! I had booked a Pulsar, Neurospa and flotation bath, in that order, for a total of 3 hours. First, I should say that it had been a very stressful day, add to that the fact that I was curious and unfamiliar with my surroundings, so I never really relaxed, but that's in no way related to Ovarium. I'm sure if I were to go back, I'd go with the flow a lot more. I was worried about the Pulsar, having bright coloured lights flashing 1 inch in front of my eyes didn't seem fun, until I fell asleep, only to wake up super energized afterwards! The whole thing lasts about 30 minutes, which is ample time to relax and refuel. Afterwards, I was ushered into another section of the spa, for my Neurospa. You are lounging in an oversized chair, which emits deep vibrations to music. The goal is for your whole body to unwind over time. This sounds swell, and it is, but I could never let go of the fact that, ohmygod, I'm in a pram! It's a pram! It's an oversized adult pram, complete with overhead cap that the personnel unfolds over you. I found it all very funny, and the purpose was defeated slightly. In the end, this is a lot more relaxing than the Pulsar, and I was sleepy when my time was up. The bath, as others have described, is egg-shaped but the door opens and closes, and the inside/outside lights up or not depending on your preference and comfort level. It's a whole procedure: you have to shower and wash your hair first, then descend into the egg, and float for a good hour. You can control both the egg's door/light/music from the inside! I chose to go for full silence/darkness, which I don't regret at all! It took me a while to get relaxed; if you're pint-sized like I am, you'll find it's totally easy to rotate in the pod, tour the pod, flip-flop around, and none of that is very meditative. Still, the sensation of floating is great, and the salts make your skin ridiculously smooth afterwards (but very slick during the bath, it's surreal). A soft carillon tells you your time is up, and off you go back into the shower. My main gripe here is with the space itself: after any treatment, you are ushered back into a fairly public waiting area by the door, before being picked up and guided somewhere else, which undermined any relaxation for me. The biggest exemple is after the bath, you've taken your shower and shampooed your hair, aaaand...you have to walk the whole nine yards, and meet the whole waiting area to go and dry it in the vanity room. The staff accompanying you is ever changing, which makes it awkward i think, so you'll start a treatment with one person, and awake to someone new. Eh. Once again, I think my experience was altered by my own state of mind, so your mileage may vary. Regardless I'd love to be back, mainly for the baths and maybe try the massages.. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Halcyon is one of the coolest, most eclectic spots in all of Charlotte. While it's bit pricey, it is well worth it. The atmosphere here is one of my favorite parts of it. There are walls of windows looking out over uptown Charlotte. The dining room is small and open. It's nice, but very casual and earthy. I love the tables, they are made of what looks like huge thinly cut tree stumps. That is probably giving you a very weird visual, but it'll make sense once you see them. You also have the Mint Museum right there and you don't even have to walk outside to go to it. The cocktail menu is the most unique list you will find anywhere. You'll see all kinds of original concoctions that are created by the on-staff mixologist who is basically a genius. For food, there are lots of offerings that you won't find at many restaurants (rabbit sausage anyone?) as well as some Southern classics like shrimp and grits. The most recent dish I had there was the duck confit. It was truly outstanding. Fresh ingredients, tender meat, and loaded with flavor. If Halcyon is not on your short list of places to try, go ahead and put it on there, stat. ",0,0,0,0,1

 My fiancee and I come here often, we just love this place! They have really good complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip. Also have some very decent lunch specials available Monday-Saturday. Tonight was our first time coming for dinner in a long time. Monday night, we figured it wouldn't be too crowded, and we had a coupon we got from being in the rewards club (you should sign up too). There was a short wait after coming inside, but we were promptly seated. I thought there might be a lot of noisy children, but we were seated in the bar area so it was the perfect quiet date night. As I said, we had coupons for $1 off the 2 Enchilada meal with Rice and Beans. My fiancee got machaca and ground beef. He is very picky about his food, but he enjoyed it.

 My friend & I tried this place today for a very late breakfast. I have never been there so I was just a bit confused by the menu. Maybe b/c I was just very excited that they offer vegan food as well as organic, I love having great options. When I asked her to explain the menu to me, she did, when I asked another question about the menu (which she already went over), she talked to me really slow as if I was retarded. I get it, you already explained it, I asked a question that was answered, but no need to treat me like I have a mental disorder. I will say, my order was good, it wasn't great & it definitely wasn't amazing. The presentation of the food was sloppy, which doesn't matter since it doesn't effect the taste, but it's thrown in a small box & it was $10, I definitely was expecting more. I would say that I would possibly go back sometime BUT the girls customer service was disgusting & that made my decision not want to go back. My friend stated that there was nothing that impressed her and that she will stick to True Foods. 1 star for offering vegan food. 1 star for offering organic food. ",0,1,0,0,0

 $77 dollars for two of us on Sunday the 25th of November and the food was not worthy of a 10 dollar breakfast anywhere in the country. Everything was cold, under cooked or over cooked. We gave up on breakfast and tried the shrimp and crab legs just hoping to try to get something for our money. The shrimp were good but the crab legs were frozen. Needless to say we ate about 10 bucks worth of shrimp and left. I have to say I was very disappointed and left angry that I just paid a premium for really horrible food. I would never go back.

 Looking for a quick and portable lunch at the Coachella music festival, I stopped by Johnny McGuire's booth for a sandwich. My friend had raved about her sandwich here the day before, so I figured I was in good hands. The menu included a couple different hot and cold sandwich options--a small sampling of their full menu at the Vegas location, apparently. Most included chicken or turkey, with a mix of toppings ranging from the standard (tomato, red onion and the like) to the fancy (avocado, sprouts, jalape \ u00f1os and bacon). I don't know why, but even in the heat of the desert, I was in the mood for a hot sandwich, so I ordered a toasted Ranch Hand sandwich, which came with turkey, cheddar cheese, a ""zesty"" ranchacado sauce, shredded lettuce, tomato and red onion. The bun was nice, but that's about the only complimentary thing I can say about my sandwich, honestly. The turkey was thinly cut, but pretty salty. And I'd echo other Yelpers complaints about the small portion of meat here. It didn't bother me, as I find too many places slather layer upon layer of meat on their sandwiches, but if you're looking for meat, you might be disappointed here. The ""zesty"" ranchacado sauce wasn't really all that ""zesty."" (And to this day I'm not sure what exactly the ranchacado sauce actually was--I guess a spicy ranch sauce, nearest I could tell?) The cheese was a generous portion, but nothing all that special. (Maybe I'm spoiled with fancy cheeses back home in California?) The shredded lettuce was soggy and clearly didn't hold up in the heat. The use of shredded rather than whole lettuce also made for a very messy sandwich--more and more lettuce dropped out after every bite. Service was a little weird. The cashiers were friendly for the most part, except for the manager who kept customers on a tight leash, refusing any requests for substitutions. I understand that for speed they wanted to keep orders as simple as possible, but I think there are more polite means of achieving this than being so draconian with paying customers. Maybe dining at the proper deli might make for a better experience, but in the heat of the desert, Johnny McGuire's sandwich booth was a bit of a letdown for me. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I am a general contractor and have had dealings with many tile/flooring companies in San Diego and the metro Phx area. I went to Imperial after hearing an ad on the radio.

I was told it was in CA (no surprise all tile comes from the Long Beach ports). I was told more than once thatthey get 2-3 trucks a week from CA and that I would have my tile in 2 maybe 3 days. Well, I am on day 13 now. Multiple calls from me, none from them.

 I hate to do this since the people working there seemed very friendly. But I had a few expensive dress shirts washed and pressed there and I was very disappointed to find that (1) they usually write in permanent ink at the bottom of the shirt (but they were happy not to do this upon request), (2) one of my shirts was ironed incorrectly with most of the buttoned area folded onto itself (but they offered to fix this and have me pick it up the next day), and (3) there were large oval shaped indentations ironed into the bottom of each shirt, which they said were ""normal"" caused by the ironing machine they use. Other than that the shirts came out relatively fine, and the prices were reasonable, so its fine for your everyday business casual shirt I guess.

 The staff at Park is refreshingly friendly and welcoming. None of the typical douchebaggery-at-the-door that infects much of Fremont East exists here. All smoking is relegated to the delightful see-saw area in the very back of the courtyard. This means I can sit at the bar both inside and outside AND in the courtyard dining area without the stench of cigarettes. That in itself is reason to hang out at the very eccentric Park. Couple this with the $10 beer-and-a-shot menu --and I mean GOOD beer and GOOD shots, I had a Wexford's Irish Cream Ale and a Jameson-- and I find the Park as the first Fremont East Bar to make it into my 'downtown rounds' list. *I'm a bit sad that they got rid of the veggie sliders, without those, I see little reason to grub here. But I will still drink here. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This was the best food, by far, that I had my most recent trip to Vegas. The chips and salsa at the beginning were super yummy. I ended up asking for more of the green salsa. The tacos did not disappoint at all. Our waitress was a total doll and was super sweet. I didn't like my margarita and she quickly got me a beer. The only bummer was that we asked to change the television to the Dallas/Miami game and it took them our entire meal to do so. Besides that, it was a really pleasant and delicious experience, and I look forward to going back for their yummy tacos. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We went mostly for the experience. I walked in wearing my in and out burger t-shirt and the young lady at the door berated me for a full minute about wearing it. They were quick though to get us in our gowns and seat us, but we waited and waited and waited for the guy to come take our order or even tell us how things worked. So we had a good deal of time to look at the menu.. I get what they are trying to do at the restaurant but if you really enjoy fresh tomatoes and lettuce on your burger you don't want to eat there. I had a single bypass and a side a fries. The burger just did not have that much taste, maybe I was just missing my tomato and lettuce, but the burger was not juicey and the bun was dry. The fries tasted like they were cooked in really old oil but were better than the burger. Go once for the experiance but just have a shake and skip the burger and fries. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I keep trying to like this place, but I just can't. I sit forever waiting on a drink and trying to flag down a waitress or bartender. The food seems like it's a good menu - good variety, kinda upscale, etc, but it's just never that great. The decor is good. The service is never good. The servers and bartenders are sub-par for Vegas. The bar is mostly gaming so if you're sitting there and someone wants to gamble, you get booted. Last time I was there we moved for some gamblers. The guy behind the bar told us our tab would get switched to a table. When we paid the waitress took our cards. Then the bartender (a woman) came over and told us we didn't pay. We explained the waitress had our cards. She accused us of walking out on the bar tab. I told her the guy had told us our tab would get switched over to the table. Then she said there was no guy behind the bar (apparently I was hallucinating.) The manager came over and didn't handle it any better than the bartender. My friend ended up cussing at her and then it just went downhill. I can get bad service anywhere and NOT be accused of trying to walk out on a tab. It's pretty ridiculous to accuse us of that when they actually had our debit cards in their possession! Overall, I'm done with this place. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My sandwich was fine. The spicy meat sauce was a little runny, but the flavor was pretty good. Tried three different kinds of meatballs on my sandwich and figured I probably wouldn't even be able to tell the difference, but I could. They were all good, but I liked the classic one best. The bread was nice and soft, but didn't fall apart. They charged a buck extra for some mozzarella and/or parmesan cheese, I thought that was kind of ridiculous, but the sandwich and drink weren't expensive by Vegas shopping mall food court standards, and it was plenty to eat.

 They make a pretty unique and filling meatball sub, (not full round meatballs - more like crumbled seasoned meat). The cooked fresh mushrooms were requested on the side. They were a nice addition to the tomato based sauce. I love mushrooms. Since there is only a $1 difference between the large 14"" and small 10"" sub - still sizable (the small comes with fries), make sure you specify the size. The delivery order arrived with the small size plus and extra fry which was a mistake as again the large comes with fries. Upon calling to the owner to let them know they were attentive to the error and seemed to care. Due to this, I have kept the 5 star rating, as this old school establishment deserves the benefit of the doubt. It turns out they opened in 1984, so it's not 30 yet. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Rooms are small, but then again... it's a casino hotel. They WANT you to be uncomfortable in the room so you'll be more likely to gamble downstairs. Also, the walls are exceptionally thin. There was a pervasive odor of stale cigarettes throughout the hotel. Either the air scrubbers weren't doing their job or something was off. I was there a week and it was not until the last night that I figured out that it was the plastic mattress pads on the beds that made me so irrationally hot every night, waking up in a pool of sweat. Really? Plastic mattress pads in a supposedly 4 star hotel?? The good? Thomas, the concierge. First rate guy with wonderful recommendations. Would I stay there again? Probably not.

 So I came here with my friend over the weekend. After looking at their menu, I proceeded to ask if they were affiliated with Sumo Sushi and the waitress said yes. The environment was lovely and just love all the bench seating. The service was great until after we got our desserts. No refilling of water and they weren't anywhere to be found. The food was okay, nothing great. They made their rolls really weird is all I can say. For instance, philly roll, instead of putting everything inside the roll like its suppose to be, the salmon was on top and it just made it taste a bit off. Their poke tasted pretty horrible. It didn't seem like nice big chunk of smooth tuna, instead it was grainy like. The hand roll was just filled with rice, just way too much. Overall, I didn't enjoy myself. I definitely would not be coming back at all. I prefer Sumo Sushi I/II instead. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My brother swears by the AE jeans - its what he wears. They don't work for me. I will admit I have some nice button down shirts given to me as gifts over the years - that's what I went into look for today. I went through several shirts and sizes up front, wondered the store a bit, looked at some jeans and other shirts as well. There were 2 associates on the floor. Neither acknowledged me in any way shape or form while I was there. On a visit after this initial review - same exact scenario but I was the only one there on a weekend evening - I was acknowledged by an associate whom I stood in front of and she informed me of their sale going on. I have shopped there a couple times previously and don't recall a negative experience with service - they just must not be trained to be proactive. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have had two experiences at Luna Cafe, one of which was good. Went there a long time ago with my mom and little sister, and loved the atmosphere and thought the food was decent. The second time we went my entire family (8 of us) went after my little sister's graduation from high school. We made a reservation to do the ""Chef's Special"" meal in which you are given 8 to ten courses of tapas not on the menu that the chef creates. We showed up at 5:30 or 6, when our reservation was, and they were very under prepared. We were also all STARVING, and my grandfather is diabetic, and after being seated requested some bread or a started to help tide us over until the food arrived. She brought the table of 8 four slices of bread. About a half an hour after arriving we got the first dish, and the others followed, each taking about 30 or so minutes. The dishes were EXTREMELY underwhelming, and the first 4 or 5 were cold. ONE shrimp, or ONE small slice of cheese. There is no way these could count as tapas. They were bites. Needless to say, very disappointing, not worth the hefty price tag. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The first time I came here was to pick up some Valentine treats for the hubby. I chose some type of jello with a rose on top of it. I wasn't sure how it was going to taste but it sure looked cool so I added it to my goodies. It tasted good! It's hard to explain the taste though. I also added two more chocolate pastries to my mix. Chocolate pastries are always yummy! I came here right after work so I was a bit hungry. I wanted to try their French Onion soup. It was also very delicious with nice gooey cheese and fresh bread . It is definitely recommended for the soup lovers out there! The second time I met a friend here for coffee and some Tiramisu. They have a nice room off to the side to sit and chit chat with your friends. I just think the room isn't living up to it's full potential . It think some big black and white striped wall paper or damask wall paper would really accent those pictures they have on the wall. (just my opinion) The Tiramisu and coffee went lovely together. This is a nice relaxing place to hang out and eat whether it is by yourself or with others.I didn't feel rushed out which was nice since the seating is very limited. ",0,0,0,0,1

 A sports bar in Scottsdale you assume would have a little of that Scottsdale flair right? A little style, a little pizzazz, even with a rougher edge for those who don't fully embrace the Scottsdale flavor!!?! No! No it doesn't. What it is, is a water hole for those drunkards that happens to walk by. A pit stop during a switch in bars, or clubs.. because nobody in their right mind decides to go out, go all the way to Scottsdale and go to THIS place. That plainly doesn't happen. Someone mentioned a smell.. I thought that was my memory serving me wrong, but that is a thing I do remember too.

 ooooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooh, a place sooo good, I had to review it right when I woke up the next day. Friends from LA had been telling us about Robata Jinya opening its sister restaurant here in Vegas...and thanks to foodie friend on IG, we saw that it finally opened. The roomie immediately ""dragged"" me here specifically for their shrimp toast as Robata's shrimp toast is his ultimate fave food. I, on the otherhand, was looking forward to trying their ramen (it is a ramen bar, afterall). Got here around 10pm, and it was fairly slow with half the place filled. Nice d \ u00e9cor with a large table in the middle; perfect for larger parties. You could tell that it just opened as there was still decorators tape on the mirrors and walls. Sat down and was gladly seated by the waitress and she was very informative on the menu and what they're known for. Roomie immediately ordered the shrimp toast but, it was sadly sold out --- lemme tell you that the roomie was like, ""ohkaaay, lets leave!"" lol We settled on fried chicken, shrimp balls, truffle fries, veggie ramen, and two combo orders of the #1 tonkatsu black ramen with charshu and Tokyo curry bowls. Fried chicken - Nice batter on the chicken, juicy, and VERY good with or without it's ponzu dipping sauce. Shrimp balls - First thought when biting into this deliciously crunchy cream cheese filled morsel: it tastes like shrimp chips!!!!! All you/us Asians know about shrimp chips! YUM =) Truffle fries - Can never go wrong with anything truffle but, I just couldn't get enough of the truffle ketchup =))))))) Tonkatsu black ramen - My new favorite as the ""thin"" noodles were al dente and just to my liking. Broth wasn't salty at all which is extra to my liking cuz I'm not into salty/miso flavors. Broth was, also, light and not too heavy which made it easier to finish the whole bowl. The mushrooms and garlic chips added the extra crunch which is always delicious. Sadly, they were out of egg so didn't add egg to these ramens; but, added extra charshu instead -- I ain't mad at that. I really liked the charshu in the ramen yet, the charchu bowl was very whatever. Their Tokyo curry rice was sweet and I don't like sweet curry. I was hoping for a more spicier version. (((((so, on that aspect - no one is touching Ramen Sora's curry and charshu bowls!))))) Veggie ramen - Roomie found it but, thought there was tooo much veggies in there and the broth was rather bland. Overall, a new favorite and I'd gladly come here again and, hopefully, soon! Especially since I still have yet to try their shrimp toast! *****side note: they have the best women's bathroom....it's a BIDET with SEAT WARMERS! lol***** ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've been coming here for the past few years now and wanted to let the world know about the journey my taste buds took earlier. I'm not big on swine, but these dishes I tried earlier turned me into a ""born again"" pork punisher. I had some piggie cooked to perfection in coconut milk/ ginger, white rice, and more of that fine swine; drowning in a smooth peanut sauce. My mind wanted to keep goin but my tummy was at full capacity, so my ideal summertime dessert of ice cream (taro/jackfriut/or coconut) with jackfruit and coconut gel aka Halo Halo had to wait until my next visit. Don't let your eyes trick you into thinking that it doesn't taste like a lil bit of heaven or wait until you can get a groupon to check it out!! Take the fam or get some true bang for your buck by going there for the first friday of each month when they have an ALL YOU CAN EAT BUFFET of food that's fried or cooked in a banana leaf for only $9.99 per person.

 Two things save this from being a 1-star review: The crab legs, and the desserts. Visited on a Friday evening around 9pm when you would think a buffet would be at its best since the dishes are being refreshed frequently, but if this was Flavors at its best I shudder to think of what its like at its worst. The crab legs were suprisingly good for a buffet, especially considering the quality that you get on the rest of the buffet. Desserts were undoubtedly the highlight. Small portions so you can try multiple offerings, and every single one of them was great. Plus the gelato station was a great touch. Nothing else on the buffet was even restaurant quality. There are Italian, Asian, Mexican, and traditional American sections, plus a salad bar, and I tried a bit off of each section and there's not one thing that would have been acceptable if you ordered it at a restaurant. Even the low tier buffet chains around the US like Golden Corral, Ryan's, Furr's, etc crank out better food than this. Service was ok. Great on refilling drinks but it took a while for used plates to be cleared. If you're getting comped or gluttony is your thing then go for it. Or check your insulin level at the door and splurge on nothing but dessert. Otherwise stay away. It's terrible. ",0,1,0,0,0

 To call this an ""art gallery"" is a bit misleading, but only a bit. You see, The Mattress Factory does indeed contain art, but for many folks the large-scale installation pieces may not be what they consider ""art."" From Kusama's Mirrored Rooms to Turrell's Pleiades to walking three buildings down to see the additional exhibits this museum takes effort - but it also rewards you for that effort. While I cannot say I loved everything at TMF, much of it was very well done and at least worth exploring once. The location, far off the strip and seemingly miles away from the traditional ""Art Museum"" experience is great - somewhat akin to SoHo or Chelsea's large buildings full of independant galleries. Actually, walking away from the Matteress Factory it was indeed Chelsea that entered my mind - and Chelsea is larger in scope, scale, and quality.....and largely free. I realize not everywhere can be New York, but not everywhere is a five star experience, either. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I am a Silver Preferred member on US Airways. This has gotten me the same lousy level of customer service representatives, the same lousy website (why do I need to call you to view my itinerary when the flight number changed?) as everyone.

 After drinking all day at two Memorial Day parties we ended up here around 8pm (with my girlfriend in tow). Having been to few strip clubs, my first impression was ""what a freaking dump"". The Candy Store has charm though, and by the end of the night I actually liked the place - it's the strip club equivalent of a dive bar. The place is kind of small but there were plenty of good places to sit. I'll return for the $5 drinks and $5 lap dances.

 I've been waiting to try this frrrozen hot chocolate that everyone rants and raves about. The location of this restaurant is right on the strip with a walk way that leads to the casino of Caesar's palace behind it. Unfortunately, the wait was OUTSIDE in 115 degree heat and that was an automatic ""HELL NO"" They had groups of tables steps down from the main waiting area where there were misting stations.. did I feel the mist? No. We found the brutal 45 minute wait to be too much so we decided to just go for the To Go window. Afterall, the main focus was for the frrrozen hot chocolate anyways.... Even then, the wait was still 20 minutes and I saw how they made the frrozen hot chocolate. I guess I was expecting some unique way of making it, but a traditional blender was used with chocolate powder, milk, and ice with whipped cream on top and chocolate shavings. (IMHO) It's good, don't get me wrong but I could go to Wendy's and get a frosty for 99 cents and taste the same thing... ",0,1,0,0,0

 I certainly expected a much better lunch experience from Bluephies. Things started off well as the staff was nicely dressed, professional and greeted us and seated us promptly. The person I was with has worked in maintenance for years and he started to point out how unkempt the restaurant was. There was dust in the corners, hand prints on the kitchen door, a smudge of something on one of the walls, gum under the table. Then he dropped something on the floor and told me to look over by the window behind the booths. There was weeks worth of napkins, trash, dirt etc piled up behind there. How can the cleaning staff miss this? Bottom line is that the place is filthy. But we still ordered and our service was actually very good and the dishes were done up nicely and had good flavor. We felt they were a little pricey for the portions and should have been a few dollars less. If they just knew how to clean the place our experience would have been a whole lot better. Yuck!

 We pulled in on Saturday morning and valet was a mess. We got in line and didn't move for 5 minutes, got cut off a few times, and ultimately decided to go into the parking structure instead. The first few floors were crazy, but the 6th floor was nice and empty, so parking ultimately wasn't too bad. Time for check-in. We received an e-mail earlier in the morning that said we could do early check-in for an additional fee, but declined and took our chances and tried checking in at 1 instead of 3. We got in line, waited for about 20 minutes, and were told that our suite was not ready quite yet. No biggie, since we were a bit early, there were a ton of people, and it was a holiday weekend. We were told to check back in 30-45 minutes. Went back at around 1:45-2, and were told that the room was still not ready and to give them about another hour. Okay, so maybe were were a little ambitious, so we decided to go back at 3, which was the standard check-in time. We decided to have some drinks at the bar near check-in and do some exploring while we waited. The bar was nice, drinks were good, and enjoyed looking at the memorabilia displayed throughout the hotel. 3:00 rolls in and we try again, for the third time. Wait in line again, and are told that the room is still not ready and to come back between 4 and 5!. My friends and I are now getting impatient, and wish the front desk would have just told us a realistic return time instead of having to go back so many times...and check in was supposed to be at 3!! ""Ok, FINE"", we're all thinking, ""let's go to the pool"". We finally decide to check our things in and go to the pool. So nice! there are a few different pools to choose from, beach pool that has sand in it, DJ, and tables for beer pong. We grabbed a bucket of shock tops, and my boyfriend paid $15 for a bottle of water (ridiculous). It's now 4:30 and we all just want to go to the room and get settled in. We find our other friend at a cool bar inside the hotel (with a sweet chandelier made of chains) and the bar tender there made us some drinks while we decided what to do next. He was so nice and we regretted not getting his name! Finally, at 4:30, 2 of my friends decide to go back and try checking us in (for the 4th time), where they are told, AGAIN, that the room is still not ready. This time, the concierge was being really rude to them and to another party who was going through the same problem. I understand that it was a crazy weekend and he had probably been hounded on by other customers, but we were being nice and understanding (i mean, come on, after waiting for almost 4 hours) and to be disrespected by an employee representing Hard Rock was now the icing on the cake, the deciding factor that we would probably never be back. We then asked to speak to the manager, and the rude concierge said something like ""so you want me to pull him away from another customer just so he can talk to you?"" Shocked and feeling like this must be some kind of joke, we said yes. One of the managers finally came to talk to us and was able to help us out. We told him the situation and said that while we understood it was a busy weekend, we felt like we were being understanding and that the concierge really just sent us over the edge. He apologized and thanked us for our patience (since some other customers were yelling and cussing in the lobby out of frustration) and agreed to get us into the Body English nightclub with 5 free drinks and a $50 comp to our room. Finally, we get to go to our suite! Sunday comes along and it's a disaster to get into the pool area. We go to the 2nd floor to get in, and the security guards say ""you either have to go back to your room or downstairs"" rudely and without explanation. We get sent around to 4 different areas, and each time, the security guards would tell us something different. We just wanted to go swimming in the regular pool :( Our friends got in but couldn't take their bags because it was ""too big"" (didn't see a sign and were not told about bag regulations) AND we saw 2 other girls get in with their own alcohol. There was a HUGE line to get to the pools, and heard there was some sort of stampede of people at one point because of a fight or something. Someone in the elevator told us that some girls had waited 4 hours to get in and got kicked out shortly after. After about an hour or two of being given the run around, we finally get in. The pool was nice but we are all just so over it and regretting not having stayed at our regular hotel. Overall, staying at Hard Rock was a mistake. I know it was a holiday weekend, but things were so unorganized and chaotic, it was incredible. The staff just seemed unprepared and rude, and our party felt ripped off for having paid almost a grand for our suite (which may not be a lot, but it is to us!). It was nice of the manager to get us into the club with free drinks, but we were never given that $50 comp to our room. We will not be back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Staff was really nice. Selection of bakery items all looked.. sort of blech. Nothing that made me think ""ooh that looks good"". We ended up getting a thing called a ""s'more"" (graham crust with marshmallow and chocolate on the inside) and 3 brownie bites that had frosting on the them. They looked cute and I hoped they'd be tasty. The s'more thing was ""ok"" but tasted artificially flavored. I won't say it wasn't good. But it tasted 'previously frozen'. It was .99 though, and so I guess for the price that's about right. I would say though, that for something home-made, I'd pay three times that. The brownie bites were HORRIBLE though. Bought three for a couple bucks (2-something). They tasted like they were frozen without being covered appropriately. Freezer-burn. But they had a distinct flavor of garlic or something. Plus, texture-wise they were no better than a box of those brownie bites you might get from Costco or something. While I'm not saying it's wrong to buy pre made items and turn around and sell them, I do think it's a bit mis-leading to call yourself a bakery. Plus, if you're going to do that, you should at least store them in a way that keeps them tasting like whatever they're supposed to be and not whatever they were stored next to. To be fair though: obviously there were quite a few items we did NOT try. They had a few lovely pictures of wedding cakes as well, that I couldn't comment on regarding quality. So take this review for what it is, based on what few items we tried. However, based on those few items (however low priced), I really don't think we'd be back to try anything else. ",0,1,0,0,0

 So we went here with a group of friends on a friday night right after work and i gotta say it was decent but not over the top. they do offer the same things that they have at Buffet @ Asia but a little less on quality. The seafood they offer needs work the snow crab legs were very cheap looking and not that fresh because how you can tell its fresh is once you start opening them they still snap on the shells these crab legs were very soft and spongy and very little meat. the fried crab was better but it was cold. One thing i did enjoy was the space here as compared to other buffets it doesnt feel cramped and i appreciate that. When you have a buffet make sure the food is hot because people like fresh food not something that has been sitting for about 10-15 min before you bring it out. Some cool things that they did have were dim sum and sushi which were ok and the dessert here was a big selection of it from fruiot to yogurt to cookies and cake. For about $13 its a solid cheap buffet so you get your moneys worth but dont expect me to come back to this for i rather go to buffet @ Asia for the quality and for $2 more. ",0,1,0,0,0

 A lot smaller than I thought, so trying to cram in and find a seat is next to impossible; the people with laptops studying usually don't leave very often. But the coffee was great, very smooth and not served scalding hot. The food looked good although we didn't stay to find out, just way to crowded to be enjoyable. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Located near Fremont, this is a great place to enjoy a meal. If you happen to be wandering off of Fremont, you'll find Triple George next to Pizza Rock. You walk into a huge bar area. Plenty of seats in this front area. It's very clean and the hostess was friendly. We were dining there for lunch and she gave us a table in the back. The back dining area seems like a completely different place. It has a darker and more intimate feel. There are tv screens in the wall for some entertainment. Justin was our waiter and was a delight. We had great service throughout our meal which made me very happy. I decided on George's Club with fries. This sandwich is huge and could only finish half. It was actually piled too high for me to get my mouth around it. Fries were crispy and delicious. I would have no problems coming back here when in the downtown area. Thanks for a great lunch!

 So, the prices are a little higher on most items in the store. The trade-off is that you can ask anyone who works here where to find something, and they will walk with you to the item's location. They'll also ask if they can help you look up some obscure part number for your sprinkler system. The girls working the registers are always friendly and helpful, too. If you need a key made or some paint matched or something for your yard or a tool, Ace is so much more convenient and well organized than warehouse stores are and the service just wins. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I know tanning is absolutely terrible and I'll probably end up with skin cancer but nevertheless I go once or twice a week to help hide some skin spots I get on my legs during the winter. This Palm Beach Tan is my location of choice because it's in the Park Road shopping area with all kinds of shopping and dining close by. As far as tanning salons go, this place is the middle of the road. They have lots of beds (around 20 total) with a few different types of beds. They have the regular bottom of the line beds, beds with bronzing bulbs (a step up from the bottom), stand up beds, and the jumbo size melt your skin off talking bed with air conditioning. They also have the spray tanning system. When I come here I always use the stand up beds because they don't cause pressure spots anywhere on your body like you get in a lay down bed (those spots on your shoulders that won't tan in a bed), and their stand up beds are a little stronger so I only have to be in there for 5 minutes. Only tanning for 5 minutes is wonderful because you're not in there long enough to get hot and sweaty. Plan on spending 20 minutes in a regular lay down bed. Their facility is fairly clean, but their bathrooms could definitely use some work. This location gets extremely busy during after work hours, so be prepared to wait in line if you show up between 5 and 7pm. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Decisions, Decisions. I swear the menu is larger than the Cheesecake Factory's. They must have every possible permutation of tea or boba drink at this joint. Unfortunately, I never really venture past the tried and true here. Perhaps it's because I have no idea what some of those things are (what exactly is grassy jelly?) Too bad, because I could come here every day for months and never have the same drink twice. My favorite is the plain old iced honey green tea. It's never too sweet and it's always got that nice stiff green tea flavor with tannins to boot. I could probably live off this stuff. I do love to come here and hang out. On my most recent visit, a friend and I plopped ourselves in a booth, ordered a couple drinks and chatted. No one even so much as bothered us and if we wanted something, we just waved someone down. They did eventually ask us to pay, rather than just dropping a check off, which kind of surprised me until I realized it was past 3am. We had been there for 5 hours and never felt any pressure to leave that whole time. One of these days I will have to order a desert. Some of those concoctions look pretty tasty. Oh, now which one?

 I don't understand how this place has so many stars, it's definitely not a 4 star establishment. Bottom line - it's not worth the price. I ordered the fez salad; it's basically two handfuls of field greens, three halves of CANNED pears, barely a tablespoon of goat cheese, and a few slivers of almonds. The menu clearly states ""cinnamon marinated pears"", such bullshit. Totally false advertising. My husband ordered the bleu cheese burger, the patty had the texture of meatloaf (gross). They need to hire real kitchen staff who will prepare what is on the menu. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My shooting hobby is now something that I can enjoy more because of the facilities here. I am a new owner of a shotgun, and this is a great place to learn. My handgun skills are getting better, too. This is because this place is top notch in the facilities, the ranges themselves, and the safety. The safety rules are strictly enforced, and it makes for very pleasant shooting times! This is also very close to my home, but still feels as if it is way out in the country. It's located on 3000 acres, and the handgun/rifle range backs up on open land with large berms to catch the bullets. They also offer skeet, trap, and archery ranges, too. I can't imagine anyone giving this less than five stars because of the facilities, the events/leagues, training, stores, and once again, the highest attention to safety for everyone. Five-star, best rating. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This was some excellent food. We were a large group (14) without reservations and hitting it right at 6pm on a Thursday. We were seated after maybe a ten minute wait. They had a good beer selection of some local brews as well as some of my favorites (Abita for example). And the beers are BIG! I thought the food was delicious. I had the fried chicken sandwich (add avocado) and mashed potatoes. The chicken was buttermilk fried chicken and the mashed potatoes were garlicky and tasty. My husband had the short ribs and they were melt in your mouth fall off the bone fantastic. He had the peanut slaw and vegetable medley for sides and both were also very good. The prices were more than I would normally pay for BBQ but I chalk that up to it being Vegas. Everything in Vegas is a gamble. One place is cheap and delish, the next is expensive and meh, but this one was darn good. Our server was attentive and quick without being pushy. The faux Texan accent he affected was unnecessary as we weren't looking for ""authentic"" in Vegas. I mean, nothing about that city is authentic. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This was my 3rd time here and very disappointed!! They had NO salsa bar, no one ordering food but it took about 10 min to have some one come and ask what i wanted. The counters were dirty like they caught something on fire and the ambers blew on to them. Ordered 3 Carne Asada Tacos and a Carne Asada burrito. Also chips and guacamole. It was $4.15 for chips and guacamole and it wasn't worth it. The chips were hard, stale and the guacamole was flavorless. The Carne Asada tasted like it wAs cooked with fish! Awful!!

 Solid 4 stars. My friend and I were looking for a nice place to eat before hitting up Ghostbar, and Little Buddha was perfect. We made a 9:30 reservation but it wasn't crowded when we arrived. I loved the decor and ambiance. I had the saketini which was not overly sweet, and went with the $45 4 course menu. The hot and sour soup was amazing, and I easily could have downed a second bowl! The lettuce wraps were actually small scoops of sushi, and I'm glad my friend asked about it beforehand as she hates fish. For my third course I went with the 12 pieces of sushi and sashimi. It all tasted fresh, and I enjoyed the salmon and whitefish the most. I chose creme brulee for dessert, and it was wonderfully rich with a hint of coffee flavor. I couldn't even finish half, but it was everything creme brulee should be! Our bill for 2 drinks and two $45 four course dinners was $121. Pricey, but not bad for Vegas. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I had one of the most satisfying all around meals I've ever had at this restaurant and I cannot wait to go back. I went for Pittsburgh Restaurant Week and ordered the fixed three course meal and every dish was not only something i had never tried before but was also delicious. The best part of the meal was a goat cheese and balsamic ice cream which i was nervous to try but was actually mind blowing. As it was Restaurant Week the place which is fairly small was very packed but the staff was incredibly social and very helpful in describing all of the food and wine pairings. On top of all of this I got 3 orders and three drink pairings for $30 which was incredible. I cannot speak highly enough of my all around experience here. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I went here anticipating a great happy hour and Emeril Lagasse Food. Instead, when my wife and I arrived at the door, the hostess asked if we were ""lost or just looking around"". Immediately, this was an insult since you have to go downstairs at the Palazzo and the only thing down there is the Stadium. We entered and went to the part for the online advertised ""Tail Gate Party"" which ended up being false. Instead of all the great happy hour specials, it was $3 domestic bottles....who gives a $HIT.

 We are locals and this used to be our favorite restaurant. We had the locals card and would get a discount when we ate at the restaurant. The last time we dined there, I gave my locals card to the waiter when we ordered. At the end of the meal when we got our check I asked for my locals card back. I also noticed we did not receive a discount on the check. The waiter brought the card back CUT UP and told me they no longer accepted it, and that I needed to join the fins up club for special offers through email. I didn't appreciate that he cut up my card -I would have liked to saved it as a souvenir. I thought that was pretty rude. We haven't gone back And don't plan to. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This location is creepy. There is an abandoned bank next to it, and a bunch of homeless live there. They are always loitering about in front of the store or at the gas pumps just begging for money. It's really quite annoying and kinda scary at night. The inside of the store is grungy. The cashier that works nights is always on her damn cell phone its like glued to her head. Today she was talking to someone about doing her laundry. Wtf. Honestly it is so unprofessional to be on the phone while helping customers, let alone your fucking cell.

 Who would ever guess that Beaver Choice was a Scandinavian restaurant? And across the parking lot from Ted's Hot Dogs? The convoluted naming history apparently originated from the Mascot of a University they originally were sited near in Canada. But beavers and hot dogs and Massage in the same center? The food is unusually wonderful and . . . unusual. The family cooks and servers are over the top friendly offering samples and telling you about all of their offerings. The atmosphere is uncomfortably stark, sterile, and small (less than 400 ft2). Their obvious target customer is take-it-out since they offer a 10% discount if you take-it-out. It is not a restaurant you go to to relax, sit back, and enjoy. It is so small we watched as the cook dipped his ladle into the pot, then tasted the contents, tapped the ladle on the side of the pot, added something else, tasted, tapped, and added several more times before going to another pot and repeating the process - yikes!

 What a blast!!! I found this place on restaurants.com and we rented a car for our first day in Vegas. What a good choice. The place looked nice on the outside and it was equally as charming on the inside. A quaint dining area, a hibachi grill and the sushi bar. We oped for the sushi bar since that is what we were there for... The only oddity was the music selection, definitely Pandora playing (the non-subscriber channel), chock full of advertisements every 3 songs or so, a bit distracting but nonetheless a decent ambiance for the mainly 20-30s groups in there. We decided to go the Nigiri route. Damn they have some AMAZING preparations.... We (each) had the Salmon citrus, scallop, yellowfin, San Diego Salmon, Gralic Tuna and so on... Everything was delightful and they had Mochi as well, which my GF loves, but we were so full we opted out. I had a Kirin and a small sake (HH Special) and they were trying to get me to order another round. If it wasnt for me having to return the rental car and drive 15 minutes back into town I would have.... If and when I am back in Vegas, or if you are going soon, this is a MUST GO TO SPOT ",0,0,0,1,0

 I called this store to ask for their price of milk because it wasn't advertised in their ad this week. As soon as I finished my question the lady on the other end exhales a huge breath of air as if I was the worst thing that could have existed. I hear her ask someone else next to her and the male voice stated he didn't know. She then said she thinks it's $2.98, sighed again, and then said she's going to connect me with the dairy manager. When I'm transferred a guy picks up the phone, I ask my question and he says ""uhhhh, well the Shamrock Farms milk will be on sale next week 40% off. That starts Wednesday"" Omg. Why are these people in customer service and who is managing them?! I ended just driving to Fry's which was further (and I was trying to avoid the further drive). Fry's had their milk price advertised but I was hoping if bashas' was cheaper or the same I could go there. I usually get better customer service at this location than at other Bashas' locations but no matter which store I go to, I get the feeling of a struggling business with employees that have been there for awhile and are just there to scan and beep at the register or stock shelves.

 I hadn't been to a Steak 'N Shake in years. We used to go quite often when I lived back east since they were open 24 hours and it was a good spot to hit after a night out drinking. I'm not sure if my taste buds have just changed, if the burgers I've had here and in LA have upped my burger requirements, or if this particular one just kinda sucks, but it's definitely not what I remember! So my first complaint are the hours here. This is a 24 hour town, yet this Steak 'N Shake closes at either midnight or 1am depending on the day. That's pretty lame. I'd personally never even eaten at the chain back east until at least 2am, so eating here during the day was a first for me. And this was my first experience ever eating here sober too. I always remember their shoestring fries being insanely good and crispy! Not here thou, they were very bland and almost mushy. I remember the burgers being very tasty, but it was just blah, barely a step up from someplace like Micky D's. I ordered a shake for old times sake and it took forever to arrive. I would've liked to have it during my meal, especially since I ordered it at the same time. But it didn't arrive until I had about 2 bite left of my meal. That was pretty annoying! All in all, I really doubt I'll be returning. The line to get in was ridiculously long, so the 30+ minute wait for a bland and underwhelming meal wasn't something I'd like to repeat anytime soon.

The cheesy hashbrowns were also quite good. They also freshly sliced thick cut bacon. The continously filled mimosas were a nice touch as well. There are so many desert options.

One of the better hotel/casinos on the strip. Lovely interior. Grand Canal Shops are in this hotel. Tao is here and is supposedly a hot spot.

 The only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars is because their carne asada burrito was good. BUT, I'm never coming back here again. 1st of all, the price on their drive-thru menu is different from the window price - which was more, of course. 2nd, they don't do any substitutions in a burrito; paid $2 more because I ""added"" beans & cheese. 3rd, the lady at the drive-thru didn't warn me it would be more $ for my ""added"" items and didn't really care that the prices were different on their drive-thru menu. All she said was ""the owner said he updated the prices"" - no real apology or any accommodations for their misled menu. ",0,1,0,0,0

 If you're looking for furniture to fill your Cophenhagen themed decor that should not be touched by pets, human beings under 4'11"", or anyone that might cause a slight wrinkle in your expensive leather, this is obviously not where you should be looking. If you're looking for a more realistic couch that's meant to be used quite often, durable, and extra comfy in case you get kicked out of the bed more nights than most, then you should definitely start here. I spent a day looking for the right sofa, no joke. I went from Indian Bend (Jack's Warehouse, American Furniture) to Chandler (Ikea, My Pigsty, World Market). My mileage looked like I had gone to LA by the time I was done. After you go to a couple of places, you start seeing the same material, styles, and even the very same couches no matter how many times you blink and you're left to only decide depending on the store's prices/sales. I hate being bombarded by salespeople who start ranting unlimited color options for a couch I barely sat on or eyed for three seconds, but I admit it's not enough to deter me from buying anything. Pruitt's employees gives off the feeling that they're not paid by commission, and even if they were, I couldn't tell. They tell you what you want to hear, no gimmicks or fluff, and if you don't like it, they leave you in peace until you feel like talking to them again. Needless to say though, the pricing didn't add up at most of these stores and I ended up going to Pruitts and within 20 quick minutes, found a fabulous couch, $279 with free delivery, softer than floating cloud wrapped in a warm flour tortilla placed on a baby's butt. Yeah, it's that comfy. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My Honda VTX broke down on the 215. I called for a tow. Not being from Las Vegas, I asked the tow truck driver where I could find a Honda dealer, and he took me here. It was near closing time on a Saturday (the service department is not open on Sunday or Monday), so I knew I would need to leave the bike at the shop and return to Las Vegas later. Tim Shepler in service was terrific. And I was at the shop's mercy. When I called in and was told the bike was fixed - and that it only cost $115 including parts - I was very relieved. A less honest dealer could have taken me for a ride - but they didn't. In fact, they left the bike clean and shiney. I am grateful that if I had to break down that I did so only 6 miles from this shop. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Aight pimps and players here's the lowdown. If you have some kicks that need some lovin' I suggest you take a dip in your Cadillac over to Express Shoe Repair. I'm not one of these cats that has 50 pairs of shoes; I'd rather have 5 or 6 (1-2 formal, 1-2 casual, etc.) that are right on point in regards to my style and the occasion. While I must admit that I am always cool like the breeze ever so often one of my women may get a little overzealous upon the sight of me and scuff my gators in the midst of their excitement. I can't have this...scuffed gators make you look like the biggest square since Madison. In the event this occurs, I dip on over to Express Shoe Repair.

Once, I even noticed a small imperfection (Hey, a player of my stature has to pay attention to detail, you know?) and my man, Mario took the kicks back, reworked the entire job and I picked them up the next day free of charge for the additional work. You heard me right; there were no dead presidents diggin' the scene.

 Smaller than the West Side location, but that doesn't matter. Friendly folks, awesome products, fair pricing, treats/samples for your four-legged friend, and just an all-around excellent place. I've purchased everything from collars and leashes to dog food to dog toys to treats to... well, come to think of it, there's not much I haven't purchased from the excellent people at Mad Cat. I love that they're locally owned, carry great products, and offer outstanding service. Simply superb! ",0,0,0,0,1

 The customer service is terrible. I would prefer to go somewhere else if this is not the only Apple authorized store in campus. I had problem with my Mac the other day and came there to fix it. A technician guy listed it as accidental damage tier 4 and required me to pay nearly 900 bucks to fix it even though I still have AppleCare. He also told me that it would take few months to have it back because he couldn't do it and had to ship it somewhere. I went to a actual Apple store in Chicago and had it fixed for free and just in 30 minutes! Cost me 6 hours of driving. What really pissed me off wasn't because of the money (I know how much it would cost to replace the logic board) but mainly because of his attitude. He wasn't being helpful at all and was very conceited. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Food was really good, even though my order was wrong, I still ate it all. The server was really nice and I would have gave them 5 stars had the owner not been there. We waited 30 minutes for a table, which would have been fine if the owner wasn't seating his friends ahead of other people. Our table was near the kitchen and the owner kept patrolling the area, scolding servers and kitchen workers very loudly. When my order came with the wrong pasta, I said it was fine and no big deal. The owner scolded the server right at the table and lectured me about how the pasta I wanted was the wrong choice and the one they made was better anyways. Really good food, just sucks having to try so hard not to let the owner ruin an otherwise nice evening. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Sorry but this place is bogus. The only real similarity to the Midwest eateries is the name. The burgers were average but the fries were too greasy. Worst of all the place was dirty. Although it wasn't busy, all the empty tables (8-10) needed to be wiped down. It had been a long time since I Steak and Shaked, and unless I go on a road trip it will likely be a while until I do so again. I ignored the subpar reviews because I had fond memories of S n S.

 Before you get too excited, The Works is not a quality bookstore where you will discover your new favourite author. ::Sorry, guys:: It's actually a discount chain that sells discount books, stationary, art materials, toys and DVDs. I've never found anything I'd want in the latter sections but have to admit, I've spotted some great food & drink books amidst the stacks of hardbacks and paperbacks. All were priced 60-70% off the RRP and included the Wagamama Cookbook, Covent Garden Food Co - Soup For All Seasons, Levi Roots Reggae Cookbook and my personal favourite, Cupcakes From The Primrose Bakery.

 This used to be our go-to place for lake perch in the Madison area, but things have been slipping a bit lately in the food quality and portion department. I consistently get the steak and lake perch and the last few times I've had it, the steak has been perfectly cooked to order. The lake perch has been the downfall for me, though. The fish tastes like freezer to me and always has tons of bones in it. I would much rather go to the Avenue for lake perch. Always get a baked potato, and it's hard to ruin that. Salad is nothing to write home about - just a bowl of lettuce, but I do like their French dressing. Rolls are always cold with rock hard butter. I noticed last night that I had two fewer pieces of perch than I normally get. Husband always gets the lake perch dinner and he loves it, but I think his tastebuds are slipping in old age. We love that they are so good to our toddler here and they give out a treat to little ones at the end of the meal. Service is usually prompt, but last night it was severely lacking even though it was slow with several open tables. Took us 1.5 hours between ordering and finishing the meal, which is unacceptable. Waitress made several errors with our orders, took 20 minutes to get white milk, drinks sat empty for 20 minutes as well. Tip for those who want to try it - avoid the extremely busy Fridays and go later on a Saturday. You can still order lake perch (although I told my husband that we will only go to the Avenue from now on after last night's debacle). ",0,0,1,0,0

 I had lunch with two girlfriends today before catching an afternoon movie. I was completely taken aback by the prices and just couldn't get past this. I mean seriously - $12 for a kale salad wrap? Add chicken and you are at $16!!!??? For a wrap and a lttle side of fruit? It tasted fine, though a little dry, but nothing close to special or memorable. I can't justify it and don't anticipate a return visit in my future. Sorry, but there are other fresh and healthy options in the area with realistic pricing. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Out of curiosity I will return, but not in a hurry. I am pretty sure I have had real crepes before and they were not supposed to be mushy and thick. It's supposed to be thin, light, and crisp. I loved the drink menu; lots of great wines, beers, ciders, etc. and at reasonable prices. I am actually more intrigued by their soups and appetizers. A really delicous looking salad came out while I was picking over my dough ball pillow crepe with ham tucked somewhere inside. I brought my leftovers home and put them on the foreman grill and it tasted much better. The ambience and decor is really dark and romantic; I think it would make a great first date location. The irony is I just did not like the crepes... ",0,1,0,0,0

 I visited Relish as part of my Best Burgers of Phoenix challenge. It came in third place out of 16 restaurants, and is really good. Here's the review. There are some burgers that focus on the best possible meat. There are others that focus on having a great bun, or interesting ingredients. Some places, like Relish, seem to understand how important balance is, and really push to make sure it's a perfect bite. The burger recommended to me was the Cowboy. The ""kobe"" meat was a nice, juicy medium-rare, and when combined with the crunchy large onion rings, melted cheddar and salty bacon, the first bite was a hit. The lingering peppery jalapenos didn't have much kick, but instead were more like a refreshing pickle. The burger was already good at this point, but adding the homemade tangy steak sauce really sold me. Great bun, high quality meat, tasty toppings and attention to balance of flavor. Top marks for The Cowboy. To check out the other burgers in the review and photos, visit http://forkvsfood.com/best-burger-review/ ",0,0,0,1,0

 Vdara is such a cool hotel! There is no casino here - so it's a lot quieter, and there is no nasty tobacco smell, or the smell of various attempts to mask tobacco odors. I stayed here three nights. My room was on the 47th floor. When I first walked in to my room, I was surprised by how dim the room lighting was. It's as if it was intentional to form some sort of mood. My room had four different rooms - a kitchenette area, a bathroom, a living room, and a bedroom. Both the living room and bed room had large flat panel HD TVs - and with a respectable number of HD channels! The kitchenette had a small mini fridge, as well as a minibar stocked with water, soda, beer, booze, and snacks. There is also a two burner stovetop and a microwave. The bed was very comfortable. The mattress was nice and firm, not mushy. The door has an electronic lock that is activated by a chip in your room card. You wave or move the card close to the sensor on the door and it unlocks. There is also a couple of buttons inside the door that control a light in the hallway right next to the door. The color of the light provides information to the maid/cleaning staff - as to whether the room is available to be cleaned, or if you want privacy (blue light) or if you are specifically requesting maid service (green light). The staff are friendly and very accommodating. I had set the light to blue one morning and when I left my room for the day, I forgot to change the light color. When I got back to my room, there was a light flashing on my phone indicating I had a message. When I called to get the message - the message was a query as to whether I needed my room cleaned. Wow! Very thorough! The room also has power window shades that are operated by a wall switch. The room also had free internet access - available via ethernet or Wifi. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I went last night on Friday for their ""Apollo"" night--a night that their Facebook page dubbed as ""the evolution of Charlotte"" --the night where Charlotte's gay and straight community come together to party. Unfortunately this couldn't be further from the truth. If you are gay and come for the Apollo night be prepared to feel like a second class citizen. We walk in and we are told to go to a separate line to get our wrist bands. We are then told to go down the hall past the main area to the ""ivory lounge"". That's where the Apollo night is. It's a small bar area that is enclosed and has a guard in front letting people in and out. I don't think this place is really all that gay friendly, as I felt like some of the staff looked like they wanted to gay bash it's Apollo patrons. Charlotte is not ready for this and clearly this established doesn't care about it's gay and lesbian patrons. I'd much rather go to Bar 316 or Cathode Azure where I KNOW my business is truly wanted and that I am an appreciated gay patron. I will never go back to Label and wouldn't recommend it to any of my gay or straight friends for that matter. You have been warned. ",1,0,0,0,0

 So I've finally tried the infamous Lotus of Siam, supposedly one of the best Thai restaurants in the U.S. I can tell you that it is definitely not. In fact, I am pretty disappointed that this has taken the title of ""Best Thai Restaurant in Vegas,"" as far as tourists are concerned. I am trying to find a good reason to give LoS 3 stars, but unfortunately I just can't. I went on a whim with some coworkers, and we ordered a fairly wide range of food. We had the Tom Kha Kai, Pad see ew, Rad Na pork, northern red curry chicken, and the desert platter. I'll go from the best to the worst of these dishes, and why I wasn't impressed with most of them. The best dish was the dessert platter. It came with a single excellent mango, sliced and perfectly sweet. I loved it. The platter also came with 2 excellent fried bananas, a clump of nicely prepared sweet sticky rice, and a scoop coconut ice cream. All of it was great, and was by far the best part of the meal. The only downside was that it was a bit overpriced at $13.95. Next up was the Rad Na with pork. I would have been very impressed with this dish if it weren't for the over-ripe Chinese broccoli... more on that broccoli later. The gravy sauce was actually very good; I was impressed! It had a nice, somewhat unique taste with a perfect consistency. The noodles and the pork were averagely prepared. Overall, if the broccoli wasn't over-ripe, it would have been a pretty good dish. The first dish we had was the Tom Kha Kai. It had spices that I haven't seen before in this dish, which made it interesting. Careful sipping this, I nearly choked on a pepper that went down the wrong pipe! It had a red chili sauce floating above the coconut milk that gave it a nice spicy bite. I haven't had Tom Kha Kai from a lot of different places, but I have had excellent versions of this dish. This one was pretty average, however. The coconut milk seemed a bit watery, resulting in a less than potent taste. I think that most people would be pleased with this dish, but I've had better. Next was the pad see ew, which was more disappointing than the Rad Na. The over-ripe Chinese broccoli really ruined the entire dish for us. I felt like the broccoli was a bit skimpy as well with small, few pieces. I *love* fresh Chinese broccoli with thick, crunchy stems. I *hate* over-ripe, bitter Chinese broccoli. This really is a pet peeve of mine. The Chinese broccoli made the Rad Na a less-than perfect dish, but it downright ruined the pad see ew. Knowing that LoS doesn't care about stocking fresh Chinese broccoli, I would suggest skipping anything on the menu that has this ingredient. On to the joke of the meal, the Northern Red Curry. How about poorly prepared chicken broth with some hot chili in it? It was spicy, but still very bland over the white rice. I was extremely bored with this dish, which was a surprise because I've heard that the Northern dishes are the dishes to get at LoS. Maybe we were unlucky. Do yourself a favor, and don't order this. All of that said, I have never had better service at a Thai restaurant that I wasn't good friends with the manager. The servers really put out some effort to give you the feel that you are in a gourmet restaurant. They filled our soup bowls, and constantly topped up our water glasses. The staff was very friendly, and extremely professional. The wine rack is impressive, and adds to the gourmet feeling as well. If only the food was also gourmet. If your pallet for Thai food hasn't been lucky enough to taste really great Thai, this place isn't a bad one to go to as a tourist. If you are a local, or you are someone who has a more refined taste in Thai food, there are lots of better Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Woh hoppen -- maybe this was a fluke? I had a hunch we were in trouble when there was only one car in the parking lot on a Friday night, and the menu was enclosed in a plastic sheet such as you'd put a composition in. It took us 45 minutes for our sandwiches to arrive (no big deal as we weren't in a hurry), and they were just ""okay."" Again, there was only one other party in the place. Coincidentally, the next night (Saturday at 8:00 we went across the street to get pie at Coco's...and there were no cars in the Coronado parking lot at all. Come to think of it, I should have been suspicious when I called 4 days before Valentine's day and they were wide open for reservations. (We had to cancel at the last minute.) I'm not one to bad-mouth restaurants and, believe me, we always loved the Coronado...saved it for special occastions. Something is wrong here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The coffee is amazing, they really make coffee in the traditional way. So it takes a few minutes because they are using some machines. The desserts are very good and moist.

There are usually people using laptops but the place isn't a library if you want to talk then talk. The employees are very nice and presentable.

 I met a girlfriend here for dinner before heading to a concert at the Knight theater. I really wanted to give this place 2 and a half stars. Its not strong enough for three, but two is a little harsh. The place was okay, but I wouldn't go back. My drink, the blushing kiss was pretty good, but I wouldn't order it again. I actually prefer wine, but the wine list was limited. We started with two appetizers: the calamari and the Thai ceviche. The calamari was good and the ceviche was interesting. It was edible, but I wouldn't order it again. We had the cherry blossom roll, which was good. But it wasn't good enough for me to choose this place over other sushi restaurants in Charlotte. We also had a fancy spicy tuna roll (forgot the name), which was just okay. Regarding the atmosphere, I'll give them credit for the effort. It's somewhat modern and trendy. However the tablecloth across from us had several stains on it and the window seal beside us was dusty. I realize these may seem like minor points to some people. But I definitely prefer a cleaner environment when eating sushi. Overall, it was a decent meal in a convenient location. But I wouldn't return and I wouldn't recommend it. There are lots of restaurants in the area that are much better. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm not going to mince words...it's kinda expensive for what it is...until you think about all that you're getting in the price. In the interest of full disclosure, I'm a roller coaster wimp. I love them, but I'm so terrified of them that it takes me forever to work up the nerve to go on even one ride (yet, I will skydive out of a plane without pausing...yeah, let's all ponder on that conundrum for a moment). So when my brother and my husband wanted to go on the rides here, I was both excited and terrified. First, to get to the Thrills (which is on the rooftop of the Stratosphere), you need to purchase your ride tickets (~$40 for the unlimited ride band) and go through security (which is awesome because the guards have such a great sense of humor and good humoredly ""frisked"" me for the cameras. Hey, I'm Asian, we do weird pictures...it's cultural!). Then you take the elevator up to the top. As all of this is outside, I recommend that you do this on a nice day (I personally prefer night), it'll make the rides more pleasurable. I know that everyone complains that the X-Scream is too short. It's a ride that pretends to shoot you off the side of the building. And while most people complain that it doesn't shoot you out really far - I would like to point out one thing...the thing that stops your cart from going off the track and plunging to your death is a 5"" little rubber stopper. These machines look like they were last served in 1987. Think about that for a minute. NOW tell me that that ride isn't scary as all bejeezus! Then there is the Insanity which goes around the ledge of the Stratosphere. Personally, I thought it was exhilarating and definitely curled my toes up in excitement/terror! Also...magnificent view of Vegas...if you can stop screaming long enough to appreciate it. Finally, my favorite of all the rides - the Big Shot. It's like the ""Tower or Terror"" in DisneyWorld, or ""Drop Zone"" at Six-Flags. Basically you are strapped in a seat and shot up, before you are dropped. Again, magnificent view of Vegas...if you can stop screaming long enough to appreciate it. Now, I know the majority of you are like, eh, 3 rides for $36? Even unlimited that's just ""OK""...but here's what makes this so awesome: standing at the rails, and staring at the twinkling lights of magnificent Vegas. It's the only place that I've been able to find where I can take in the entire Strip all at once. Also, with a good telephoto lens, you can get some awesome pictures. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was looking forward to trying this place out after reading all the positive reviews. I walked in today at 11am and waited at the counter for nearly 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge me, take my order etc. There were a few people sitting around watching TV (not sure if they worked there) and a few people in the kitchen who looked out at me. I said hello? And no one responded, came up to the counter etc. The location is so crappy I honestly expected the service to be super friendly. I was so wrong. Some d-bag regular came in and barked his order over my shoulder while I was there and the kitchen and they didn't acknowledge him either. I literally waited 5 minutes then shook my head and left, it was possibly the worst customer service i've ever seen in any place, ever. I can't stand restaurants that are run like this. I don't care how much i'm paying, $5 or $100 for a meal I refuse to put up with it. If the people that were working and ignored me were the owners it's clear that they could care less about customer service. If it's hired help, they should all be fired and replaced. Take some pride in your restaurant!!! I won't return here. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Location: Right off a highway exit in an easy-to-access strip mall. Selection: Seemed decent, for the size of the shop; I'd give it a 3-4. I'm just getting back into bicycling so I've only hit up a few shops so far. Service: Non-existant. I was in there for a good 20 minutes and no one so much as greeted me, much less offered any assistance. You know those places where the service people are all up your @$$ like they think you're going to steal something? Yeah, these guys took the complete opposite, hands-off approach. Maybe they do a decent online business so they don't feel like they need to acquire or retain walk-in customers. What happened to just a quick, ""Hi, welcome to our shop. Let us know if you have any questions."" That would've been great. No, instead two or three of them briefly looked right at me from across the room, then went back to what they were doing. That turned me off so much that I didn't feel like trying to approach them to actually get some questions answered, so I can't vouch for their demeanor, knowledge, or attitude when engaged in conversation. I probably wouldn't go back here unless they had something specific I needed that I couldn't get anywhere else. But then again, there are amazingly friendly and knowledgable people at other bike shops around town, and I'd rather wait for them to order it and give them my business. Summary: JT's website made it look like the place to go, and it might be ok for a quick in-and-out job, but don't expect to be blown away by the service.

 I'm here all the time because my career in event marketing means lots of racing events. I love this track because they ALWAYS have free parking. Prepare for a hike to the track though if you're coming for NASCAR. It's much easier to park during NHRA. The staff they hire to work at the various events seem pretty incompetent at best, but who cares? You're probably coming here to have a good time that involves a lot of alcoholic beverages, so just enjoy yourself! The security WiLL be checking your bags before you come though the gates. Allow extra time for the drive out to Speedway Blvd, and make sure you bring some comfy shoes for the walk from the parking lot to your seats. Gentleman, start your engines! ",0,0,0,1,0

 For my second review I wanted to write a review on a restaurant my wife loves but I felt like a prisoner at. For all you guys out there take your girl there but make sure you visit Jack in the Box before you pick her up. The Good... This restaurant food was extremely tasty. Each item we ordered was flavorful on many different levels. this is definitely a Quality over Quantity kind of place. Also, the Specialty drinks were Legendary. That's about it. The Bad... Price. More to the point, we dropped about $300 w/ wine and drinks and I was still hungry. We had their full experience menu. Also the service was attentive but not friendly at all. In fact, they were very pretentious. (I had to look that word up) On the Price to experience ratio, this place just isn't worth it. It is however, the kind of place that most guys will end up having to go to. I would avoid this at all cost. There are plenty of other places that serve food that is just as good and isn't as snobby as this place. I would give it one star but seriously, the food tasted great. However the small paper thin strip of Salmon was literally the size of a notepad. You can display it however you want but charging these prices is just not for 95% of us. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The service was excellent, but the drinks are not my favorite. I thought that maybe it was just the drinks that I was getting, but after switching it up a few times, I still haven't found a drink that I would order consistently. Tropical Smoothie uses sweeteners to accentuate the flavors of their drinks and I am not a fan of that. I got the Get-Up-and-Goji ($5.39). A blend of goji berries, peach, orange, banana, and non-fat yogurt. I got mine with Splenda. I overheard a guest ask for theirs with honey. So there are options. Maybe next time I will ask for none and it will be more suitable for my taste. I just like simple all fruit smoothies. In the end, my stomach was a bit upset and the artificial taste of Splenda overpowered the drink. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Um.... seriously?!?!?! 4 1/2 stars?!?!?! I guess if you are a blue collar worker that has less than 30 minutes for lunch and you want to eat in a run down neighborhood bar atmosphere and over pay for sub par food than this is the place for you. My husband and I just ate there. He ordered the Chipotle Steak Sandwich, diet style. That is no bread and a side salad instead. It looked like something you would get in a mall food court. The ONLY vegetarian option was a grilled cheese sandwich. I got the fruit cup as a side. It was a bit hard, a bit flavorless... cantaloupe. I could have made a much better lunch at home for less than the $21 we paid to eat at South Bank Grill. I can't believe I just ate at this place!!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 For an afternoon show, Matsuri is as good as it gets! It's a very high energy show and the performers are really athletic and talented. I'm gonna agree with the other reviewers and say it again that it really does a great job taking you to dream-like world and it's like watching Cirque du Soleil at a fraction of the price. Without giving away too much, expect lots of acrobatics and dancing, clapping, monster box jumping, and mime comedy. It's a complete package! Oh, and a giant hula hoop!!!! I can't say much for the theater at the Imperial Palace, it's really small and the decor is kinda old, almost similar to the Hollywood Theater at MGM Grand. But the size of the theater benefits Matsuri in that it gives the performers a chance to get intimate with the audience just like Blue Man Group at the Venetian. Another reason why I watched this show is because I'm a big fan of Sasuke / Ninja Warrior and a lot of the cast members competed on there. It was really cool seeing those familiar faces live and in their element. It's definitely a must-see and for less than $50 ($15 for locals!!), you can't go wrong!! 5 stars all the way!!!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 When I moved back to Arizona I specifically picked a place to live that was within 5 miles of F&E so I could get coupons in the mail. I love fresh and easy. The food is pretty good quality and is very inexpensive, which is great for a college student:) I also used to work 2nd shift and their prepare meals were a much yummier alternative for dinner than having a sandwich or gross frozen meal. I will say though that I am a very picky person and typically enjoy eating the same meals every day for months (for example, I have had F&E greek yogurt, raspberries, and F&E granola almost every day for lunch for about 3 months). If you prefer a wider variety of food items F&E may not be your place; however, there is a sign out front right now that states they are working on getting over 200 new items:) ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've been to this Denny's many times. This time, I just had to add this restaurant. It's pretty terrible. This time one of my friends ordered the sampler platter (she ordered it first and I didn't want to get the same thing.)Thankgoodness! It usually comes with Mozarella sticks, chicken strips, and onion rings. Hw came back and said they didnt have chicken strips. WTF!! So they asked if she wanted the shrimp. She said okay. Then he comes back and says they don't have onion rings. So they gave her regular fries and more shrimp. At the end, no compensation or discount. Charges us for the sampler and says he doesn't have the code to give us a discount. TERRIBLE!! I would never recommend this Denny's to anyone! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Dinner time at Iron Chef contestant Chef Beau Macmillian's restaurant. first off the ambiance was outstanding! If you come here during fall as we did, try to get there before sunset. the restaurant overlooks the rocks and they look amazing as the sky changes colors. for starters we had seared foie gras and the firey calamari. Our 9 year old nephew LOVED the seared foie gras. it was his first time ever having it and i have to agree with him, it was pretty tasty. the calamari was excellent as well... not too chewy, lightly crusted, and the arugula salad underneath soaked up the sauces very nicely. for my entree i ordered the smoked pork tenderloin. i ordered it cooked to medium and it came out perfectly... i mean PERFECTLY! the pork itself was packed with so much wonderful flavor. then the buttnut puree add this wonderfully silky element... so delicious! i would order this meal again. my fiance ordered the NY steak. the butternut squash was sweet and balanced out the flavor of the beef well, but i've had better steak... his cousin ordered the bacon wrapped filet which was WAY better in my opinion. the mushroom hash was made with wild mushrooms and was very tasty. i'd get this meal for sure! the nephew's meal consisted of the kid's mac and cheese and fries. i wish that he had ordered the truffled mac and cheese as their version seemed to taste like it was made out of a certain blue box, but the fries were wonderful. as we were leaving the vallets chatted us up and very very amusing. great personalities! all in all we had a fantastic experience at Chef Beau's restaurant.!

 The setting reminds me of an upscale diner and every time I have been in it has been packed. I usually opt to sit at the bar because the service is much faster.

 This mall is ok. It is close to my house, so it is where I shop most of the time. It has some nice stores like Macy's and Dillard's. both those stores need a remodel though, they are starting to show their age. What I really hate it walking on the ground floor. Every little kiosk is trying to get your attention and bothering you while you walk. It feels like Tijuana there. I hate it and it makes me want to leave the mall quickly. There are some good food court places like chipotle and paradise. You can also eat at Chevys and have a nice margarita. It is a pretty crowded mall especially on the weekend. Overall this mall is ok, it has what I need but isn't the greatest shopping experience. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Who told Carlos Santana to open a restaurant chain? Between his god-awful shoe collection (apparently designed exclusively for hookers and the colorblind) and his collaborations with Rob Thomas (is that guy still around?), I would have thought he was pretty busy. But nope, no such luck. Enter Maria Maria, conveniently located at our newest soon-to-be-rundown fake-urban mall, Tempe Marketplace. It is, of course, a chain. But you knew that. It's pretty inside, though, and arguably less crass than some of its neighbors (*cough* Lucille's *cough*). Work lunch. Not my choice, but I'm game. Wait, how much for some enchiladas? $17? And no lunch menu? You've got to be fucking kidding me, hombre. I'm all for Nuevo Mexicano but we are at the goddamned MALL, Carlos. And that's a lot of dinero for some tortillas and beef. The food was...fine. Not gross, just boring as hell. The guacamole was pretty good, but considering its size (not huge) and price (I forget - maybe $10) it wasn't memorable. If you're prepared to go the pricey guac route, just go to Los Sombreros instead. When it comes to Maria Maria, I think Carlos said it best: ""Just forget about it."" ",0,1,0,0,0

 A mid-priced really good pasta joint would make a fortune in this neighborhood. We decided to go out for dinner. The fam wanted pasta. OK, Tutti Santi and Nick's are good but too pricey, and I've been afraid of whatever they're calling Pasta Pomodoro these days since they changed hands. Guiseppe's still doesn't get it that people with kids never, ever have cash on them. Lots of pizza places, but we don't want pizza. Someone reminded me about Carrabba's, so off we went. For a weekday night it was busy, but they found a table big enough for the 5 of us. It was super noisy. Had to yell to be heard. How can one eat a decent meal while yelling and being yelled at? Service was alright, though a bit slow. I'm pretty sure the waitress was sick because she was doing the sniffling thing and I overheard her co-workers asking if she was ok. Not cool. The wine by the glass list had some good choices. They give you the option of a glass or glass and 1/2, so of course we did the 1 1/2, and were happy with what we ordered. Entrees come with soup or salad, and both were very good. My sister got the lentil with sausage soup, which reignited some serious sibling rivalry after I tasted it. There was a shortage of simple pasta dishes for me - just too many ingredients trying too hard. The pasta and sauces all tasted fresh, and were well made. However, some of the overthought sauces were over seasoned and so were left half-eaten. I'd pick Carrabba's over Olive Garden any day, but still have my fingers crossed some smart local chef opens up a simple but good pasta joint in the area. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've visited twice, once on a Friday night and once on an off-peak week night. Going on a Friday night is/was a mistake. The place is packed, you can't make reservations as I understand it, and they have an odd procedure for putting your name down. We witnessed people being given upwards of 15-20 minutes to return once they were informed there table was ready. Frustrating. But I knew it was gonna suck as far as wait being Friday night. I'm a firm believer that NO meal is worth waiting for, expecially for for waiting over and hour - for a burger. But as I said that one is on me for going on a Friday night. My other visit was much more pleasant and prompt. Out of all the new burger joints in the 'Burgh. This place is the winner thus far. Portion sizes up to par. Tasty food. Ability to create your own burger. The only improvement would be the one I make for just about every restaurant - please stop using vegetable oil for frying. It tastes like crap and it's horrible for your health. Lard, bacon fat, butter, etc. All far better options. Burgatory has offically been added to the rotation, I'll be back. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is my second time here and everyone is very efficient and pleasant. It's not too busy during the week and they offer $20 pedicures Monday - Thursday. Perfect place to stop in for a quick mani-pedi. Chris did my pink/white acrylics and it's probably the best job I've ever had. He's very funny to talk with too. The prices are a few bucks less than other places around here. A steady flow of people came and went as I was here and they all seemed happy with their services.

 My girlfriend and I came here for a pedicure last Saturday since she lives right around the corner. When we walked in, there appeared to be a wait, so we asked how long the wait would be before we opted to stay. There were two female technicians doing manicures and one male technician doing the pedicure. One of the women told us 15-20 minutes so we decided to wait. The guy started up the foot baths and invited us to have seat and soak our feet while we waited. 35 minutes later and he is just coming over to start on my feet. The guy was really slow and kept doublechecking what he was doing. I am not sure how often he does pedicures. About 25 minutes into it, he was getting ready to start on the leg massage at which point I asked that he paint my nails because I couldn't stay much longer. This whole time my friend was still waiting on her pedicure (50 minutes) soaking her feet. About the end of my fast-forward pedi, one of the nail technicians came over to start on my friend and apologized to both of us for the wait and how long it took. And the weird thing was that the polish I chose ended up being way lighter on my toes than it looked in the bottle. So, not only was I not able to receive the full pedicure but I didn't get the color I wanted. Yes, I could have asked them to change the polish but I didn't have enough time. Had the wait truly been 15-20 minutes, this would have been a non-issue. The basic pedi was $21. For that price, I have had better pedis but I can probably forgive alot for a $20 pedi. Luckily, I don't need to come here because I got the bomb spots in CenPho. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Had another great lunch recently at the Bauer Kitchen. I really want to try the sandwiches on their lunch menu, but I'm never able to because the daily feature sandwich always wins me over. This time, I had a slow-roasted pulled pork sandwich with bbq sauce, coleslaw on a house-made cheddar ciabatta. It was extremely filling and delicious! The meat was tender and succulent, perfectly complemented by crunchy coleslaw. I'd eat this sandwich everyday! My mother had another lunch daily special- the fish and chips. I'm so happy that they let us substitute regular fries for sweet potato frites with no surcharge! The accompanying lemon tartar sauce was rather lackluster, but all in all, it was still really tasty and satisfying. What a great place for lunch! I'm really curious to try their brunch menu as well.

 Tighten up, Management. Nothing worse than a great idea, a clean facility, and decent to good food ruined by very poor and disappointing service... Breakfast this morning with a large party. Around 20 minutes after ordering, my simple oatmeal had still not arrived, while others who had ordered egg dishes etc were already eating. This was because they had run out of oatmeal. How can you wait twenty minutes after running out to come tell us it will be another ten minutes before more is ready? That is not how a dialed breakfast spot runs. They should have told us in a reasonable time so we could switch our order if we didn't feel like waiting a half hour for a bowl of oatmeal. Getting our drinks was a major challenge, too. Clueless wait staff totally unaware what we had ordered. Please cut this nonsense out already and learn how to execute proper service people. ",0,1,0,0,0

 On a cold winter day, ramen is exactly what my body and soul needed. Republic ramen had the perfect combo of diverse ramen options and boba tea. The atmosphere is casual, and the red lighting casts a cool glow on your food. Was not a huge fan of the gyoza. Good filling but the exterior was so fried and crunchy it was like a taco shell. For ramen, we ordered a traditional tonkotsu and original Tokyo style, both with pork. The Tokyo was slightly spicy with a wonderful broth flavor. As for the ""original"" toppings, fresh spinach was nice but the carrot was a bit distracting. The tonkotsu had a heavy, salty broth with rich flavor. The ""traditional"" had delicious sweet bamboo shoots. The best part was both came with a vey generous serving of pork, much more than I'm used to, and all for under $10. Simply, beautiful. I was feeling kinda sick that day, and not saying their ramen cures sickness... but the broth did warm me up and I felt significantly better after the meal! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I want to like this hotel. I really do. BUT after our first night here, I'm so irritated I can't. We have been looking forward to trying the new Tropicana. We got here around midnight yesterday after a 8 hour drive from San Diego due to a chemical spill causing delays. We were so exhausted and hungry. We went to the Cafe Beach, which I had high hopes for. Service was mediocre and slow, and the soup I had was lukewarm and the t-bone special my fianc \ u00e9 ordered in ""medium"" came out well done and tough. We were too exhausted to complain and were happy to crawl into bed around 1am. The room is nicely decorated and clean, and we were so excited to finally be on vacation and to sleep in. Unfortunately we were woken a little after 5am by some loud workout session. And if it wasn't obnoxious enough to hear the instructor yelling ""come on, Las Vegas, you can do it"" and ""Now let's do that again!"" over and over, it's been going on for TWO HOURS! So after working, an exhausting 8-hour drive, and a lousy overpriced dinner, we are woken up 4 hours later by loud workout music and yelling. I called the front desk to change rooms and was told there are no rooms available, ""It's just a 2-hour class and will be over by 7am"" and ""I'm surprised you can hear it"" - are you kidding me?! I can hear every effin' word! How about a ""So sorry, first time customer, that you're disturbed and woken early on your vacation. We will move you to a quieter room as soon as possible."" I am in a sales role and appreciate the importance of good customer service, especially with a new customer. This was not that. I understand things happen but being told just to put up with it was pretty lousy. I would have offered earplugs, a move as soon as possible, maybe even an upgrade or breakfast to make up for my customer being disturbed. But no, I was told to check back this afternoon. The fact that I'm writing a Yelp review at 7am should tell you how annoyed I am by all this. By the way it's now 7:15am and I've been listening to loud music and some guy yelling ""Here we go again! 1-2-3-4, let's go!"" over and over for hours. Some vacation. I would have been better off staying at home or another hotel. This is just our first night of three. I really hope the other two are better, because so far, I'm really unimpressed and have no reason to come back. We come to Vegas about 6 times a year and don't think Tropicana will be a place we'll be back to. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Took my Mom and BFF to lunch and we were so disappointed when the server came back to tell us there was NO duck today. What?! Today? Or just at lunch time? We placed our orders with pork, chicken, and beef then proceeded to ask our server if the restaurant was out of duck today or just at lunch. It was really bugging me. The menu shows duck as an option all over the place. She said that we were the only people who ever ordered duck. Ever? Like, as in EVER ever? She said yes. Well, I knew that was a lie. My BFF orders duck from this place on a regular basis, but that's at dinner. So, I asked if she meant that duck wasn't available at lunch only. She smiled and said she wasn't sure. Poor thing. The kitchen did her no favors by being so lazy. On a side note, a bazillion years ago my Mom taught us kiddos to check out the restrooms. If they're clean, you know the kitchens are clean... Eeewwww.... I was not pleased with the lady's room. Paper was on the floor and it was smelly. Thank goodness one of the soap dispensers worked. Another eeewww, when I got back to the table - there was a fly hovering around. Gross. Lunch orders consisted of Broccoli Delight with beef: bland, overcooked veggies; Pa-Nang curry with chicken: yummy, light on the chicken, overkill on the green peppers; and, Mango curry with pork, yummy, light on the pork Two stars because I felt bad for our server and two of three dishes were yummy. But don't forget what I said about the bathroom... Scary. We shan't be visiting this location anytime soon - more likely we'll give the family owned restaurant a second chance at the Mesa location.

 Yeah, two stars and that's all it deserves! Sure the food is really tasty but that is really all Pure Pizza has going for it. Look I get the whole organic/granola/hipster thing everyone is into these days. I like that we are getting back to real foods with real names from real people. But honestly this ""market"" aka ""food court"" is a prepackaged sterile side show! Its located in the heart of downtown Charlotte, and has the typical chalk board menus, old style metal chairs, and hokey 'barn' carts to hold food items. The walls are covered with images of vegetalbles/flowers/smiling people/and all that organic stuff. There are about 10 other shops in there (coffee, sushi, meat, wine, pizza, desserts, etc) and each one is playing on the farm local organic vibe. But come on people this was hand picked by marketing and designers to make you FEEL like your in an old world market/little farm town. And its specifically designed to pull in the younger crowd working in downtown that wants to be a part of that image. Let me get off my soap box and talk about Pure Pizza. I ordered a medium and 3 bottled waters for a total of $24. The cost was a little high, but I thought maybe the pizza would be all that other Yelpers had raved about. I figured that would be more than enough for my wife and toddler to enjoy. Anyway, yes I did enjoy the pizza, but it was more like a small in the realm of pizzas. On top of that these pizzas are thin crust, no not crazy paper thin, but thinner than I was expecting and from seeing it I knew it would not be enough for my family. Regardless though the pizza was super tasty with a great crust and the honey to dip the crust in was a very pleasing. But all it did was make me want like 2 more pizzas! But I was not about to drop almost $75 dollars on a lunch! And how much were those stinking bottled waters!?! They weren't even anything special and actually they were super cheap bottled waters with caps that were annoying to take off. But whatever the pizza although amazing on taste is too expensive for the amount you get. Yeah I know all organic and free range and vegan with no preservatives and high fructose corn syrup is worth the extra coin. But I can't recommend this place because of the cost:food ratio. It's that simple! In addition to the prepackaged 'market' theme that your immersed in... its just to fake for me. There are better values in Charlotte than Pure Pizza. I'd rather go to the Penguin for some true local flavor!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was so infuriated last night I couldn't even write this review. Apparently this has been in effect for a while, but as a STUDENT that uses the STUDENT DISCOUNT I am usually studying and not at the movie theater every night. This also means my schedule is completely filled, if I'm not in classes ""gettin' the academics learned,"" I'm working at the job I'm thankful to have in this shit-hole economy. This means when I can squeeze an hour or two into my hectic/stressful schedule for a movie it may not be on a Thursday. If you're that desperate for money ""big-man corporation"" why don't you put a donation box in front of the theater? What? You don't think anyone would put ""donations"" in the box for AMC? Well that's probably because you already ass rape the public on ticket prices and now you're doing it without lube by limiting the STUDENT DISCOUNT to only Thursdays! I agree with Amanda B. Go to Harkins! Long live the freedom for students to go to the movies whenever they damn well please and be allowed to save some coin off the ticket price and put toward the overpriced food at the concession stand. Or Hell! I may be a little crazy here, but lets do the Super Saver Cinema (dollar theater) on Bell Road and I-17! Yes they aren't a ""dollar theater"" any more, they are a TWO DOLLAR theater, but at least they aren't punching me in the pocket book - repeatedly. Oh yeah, and Deer Valley AMC 30?

 I swear I drive past this little Mexican restaurant multiple times a week and have never noticed it. One night, we were craving some quality Mexican food and started exploring Yelp to find a nearby Mexican spot that we had never tried and had good reviews. We called to see what time they were closing, because it had conflicting results when we tried to figure it out online. The staff answered and stated that they were closing in 5 minutes, but very kindly said that we could order and pick up if we could make it there within 10 minutes. We don't live too far so it was doable, and we gratefully made our way there while still on the phone ordering. I didn't have too much time to ponder on what I would order so I skimmed through the menu and decided on the shredded beef (machaca) burrito-enchilada style (I'm a fatkid). My man got the combo #1, which included 2 enchiladas, a taco and beans. Both orders smelled amazing, it was hard not to pounce into it in the car. When we got home and started grubbin' it was scrumptious!!! I had to give this place 5 stars based on their awesome customer service and delicious food. I am definitely going to have a hard time ordering something different next time because the burrito was so satisfying. We plan to come back and actually sit and eat for a meal, some happy hour and looking forward to their taco Tuesday! The new menu is a little bit different than the one posted on the Yelp page and they gave us one with our pickup order. I'll post it when I get a chance :). They only take CASH so be prepared!! Definitely a good find, THANKS YELP! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Ok, there has to be a first one, so let it be me. No I am not a friend or family that attended the soft opening. I had dinner with three friends after reading all the hype on a Tuesday night. Maybe it was the hype, maybe it just wasn't ready. First the food was good but inconsistent. My short ribs were over barked and somewhat tough. The flavors were there in the overall dish but the meat left something to be desired. The scallops and accompaniments were again well flavored but lukewarm to cool at best. The lamb was again overcooked and served cool. The salads kale and calamari were all very good. The bar area, which you see as soon as you walk in looks fun and upscale. Our dining room however was spartan and sterile with barren walls looking more like it was a restaurant in the Hyatt Place than an upscale eatery atop a uptown building. Maybe it was the newness but Fahrenheit left us feeling a few degrees short of warm. I will give it a month to work out the kinks and give it one more chance. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We reserved a non smoking KING room through bookit.com and at check in, we were told only smoking is available right now or we can get the non smoking later. We decided to check in anyway and I used the $20 trick (google $20 trick if you don't know what that is). Suddenly, there's a NON SMOKING Queen room available. I also asked nicely if we could get the Bellagio fountain view room. She said yes we would get the fountain view room. We went up to the 27th floor and we got the Sammy Davis Jr's room with full frontal view of Bellagio fountain, Caesars Palace, and The Cosmopolitan. We were so happy with our room. The tub was nice and the separate shower was a nice touch. I love their bath products including the massage soap bar. The only downside is there's no refrigerator, so use the ice bucket for your bottled drinks. The casino is fun. I didn't win anything there, but the Deal or No Deal machine is my new best friend now. I also love the Miracle Mile shops and pretty much you get everything you need at one hotel. I will stay here again. Thank you PH for an amazing experience. :) ",0,0,0,0,1

 I love ethiopian food, I also love ethiopian babes, but thats another story. While the service was standard (why is it that every ethiopian restaurant worldwide only employ one waiter no matter how busy/empty the place is) i thought the food was a bit sub standard. The injera wasnt great, the Tibs were just OK, and the veggies were not fresh. I didnt complain because the price was certainly right, but im not sure i would return there again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is a nice, steep, 1 mile hike that will give you a great workout. It's pretty rocky, and there's a few benches along the way to the top that you can use to rest. Like other people have mentioned, I would recommend light hiking shoes instead of heavier boots as this terrain is difficult and can wear out your knees and ankles - the extra weight of a heavy shoe doesn't help. Bring some water and try to go early on the weekend or any time during the week to avoid a ton of people. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Came for lunch from work, So I ordered the chicken pecan salad sandwich, it was tasty however extremely salty. They were accommodating in keeping it off the bun since I'm doing a nutrition salad. I was going to order the tandoori chicken salad as it's named, however to add chicken to it it's a ghastly 8 dollar up-charge. So now I have to pay 21.95 plus tax for a salad? I'm sorry the quality is not worth it. There seem to be some other good things on the menu that I would like to try if I ever come back but as it stands I probably won't be. They need to reevaluate their prices and what comes w each meal, for example fries aren't included w burgers or sandwiches and you are still looking at a 10+ dollar price tag. Sadly disappointed.

 I'm surprised there are people on here, who think they're treated rudely and abruptly at the Golden Greek. What makes you think you're so special?! EVERYONE here is treated that way! Food at the Golden Greek is something akin to what hospital patients in Athens would eat. While some of the food is really good (like the kebabs), some of it is unbelievably ""alien"" to what I'm used to: gyro meat like leather straps; all the Italian dishes insulting to even the rattiest Italian homeless man; and everything -- and I do mean 'everything' -- served with a side-vegetable dish of chickpeas, carrots and peas in tomato soup sauce (to be fair, the lemon soup is good as are the baklava, when they have them). Along with the chickpea-tomato soup veggies you'll get enough rice to send your blood sugar readings into the 500s after dinner. The service ... well, what can we say about the service: picture a Greek wedding where the bride and groom already hate each other before the ceremony's ended: the wait ""staff"" consists of a sister-brother-mother team. The brother doesn't do a whole lot of anything except scowl and mumble and, thankfully, spends most of his time outside ignoring your desperate pleas for more water to drown out the starchy rice stuck in your throat. The sister CAN be charming ... just like rattlesnakes don't HAVE to bite. Don't be surprised if your dinner is cooking a second time under the heat lamps while she holds a chit chat with elderly guests, who just flew in from ""I have nothing better to do with my life than talk endlessly"" Land. But the real workhorse in that place is Mom, a stocky, incredibly muscularly built woman with calves every man at the gym would die for, who cooks, cleans, and is the only one with a sense of humor ... she especially loves to laugh when you complain or drop something on the floor. And speaking of dropping something on the floor, DO enjoy the many screams and crashing plates you'll hear in the back of the restaurant from the three of them while you're trying to enjoy the bland food: think of it as ethnic entertainment straight from the Greek version of ""Married With Children"". All in all reasonably decent food, but the yelling and attitude have more spice than the mousaka. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The kid at the pharmacy is so unbelievably rude just now. My dr.'s office called and left a message at 9am and I called the pharmacy at 1pm to see if the Rx was ready and they had no recollection of this being called in so I called my doctor again and asked them to call and actually speak to the customer service agents. I gave it two hours called them back just before 3 and the kid said,""yeah we just got it but we have other ppl before you who are also waiting for their Rx's to be filled."" I said I'm aware of that but what I really felt like saying is it was called in at 9am!? I downed 32 ounces of pedialyte to hold me off from getting my medication today and u have the audacity to make me feel like I'm being rude?!

 We have been going here for several years and every time the only thing consistent is the rude staff behind the front desk. My grandson was visiting from Cali for spring break and wanted to go bowling yesterday. I am on their email list and had received a coupon for two hours of bowling with shoes, food, etc for $7.99. I asked for the special rate and was very rudely told that it doesn't apply during spring break and that lanes were $3+ and shoes were $4.50. When I asked about who has spring break now he rudely replied Paradise Valley schools. Really???? This was Scottsdale, wtf? So I paid over $30 for three of us to bowl. When I asked for two lanes (one w/ bumper for grandson) he acted really put out. We had a good time, but both my daughter and myself have our own shoes and I felt ripped off and hate rude workers, so I was mad. Then afterwords we went to the game part of the place and almost every game was broken or did not give out tickets. My grandson wanted to play ski ball he loves and they were broken too. Of course the desk people could care less. We will not be going back here again. Too many times they have treated us like crap and I would much rather take my money somewhere else where I am appreciated and provides even some sort of customer service. ",0,1,0,0,0

The teppanyaki presentation was middling, at best. Nice guy and all, just used to seeing better skills. And the older dude working the table across from us seemed to think that just adding more fire = better = big tips. Instead, he singed his eyebrows and nearly set of the dry fire suppression.

 Our first time to this hotel, we really enjoyed it. We booked a suite with a fountain view and it was spectacular, nothing like it in Vegas. We booked many months in advance and got a great rate. Our flight arrived early, but they were able to get us into a room before noon -- a big bonus, very efficient at the Front Desk. Having stayed many times at the Wynn and Bellagio, we were apprehensive about the Cosmo being too hip and trendy for us, but we were pleasantly surprised by the nice mix of old and new to the property -- there is fun modern art sprinkled throughout as well as many great old photos as an homage to ""old Vegas"", which we appreciated. We loved that you could mostly avoid the Casino level if you wished -- for the most part the restaurants are on the 2nd and 3rd floor, as well as the upper level of the Chandelier Bar. The other two lounges, The Vesper and the Queue are very nice and comfortable. The Queue was more private and secluded and had the best Cosmopolitan I have ever had (appropo!) You had access to the Strip via a walking bridge from the 2nd floor (and the Walgreens across the street, which was very handy) The hotel room was very nice, with some oddities: there are no bureaus for clothes, just the closet with a few shelves. BUT they provided robes and slippers, which was great. And hubby like that they had a suit valet, classy touch. The suite was lovely, with sliding doors from the main area and the bedroom out to the balcony and great sound-proofing. The balcony is ridiculously fabulous, with the view of the Strip and the Bellagio Fountains. We spent a lot of time out there, and even when it was windy, we were protected. The bathrooms were lovely, spacious with good amenities (and a whirlpool tub, which was enjoyed throughout the stay!) There was a small kitchen, with a full-size fridge, so you could actually fit your own beer/wine/food (just be careful not to touch anything else or you will be charged!) Two requests called into Guest Services were handled almost immediately, which was a nice touch. The pool areas were nice, but small (from what we are used to) but we managed to find a good spot at the more quiet Bamboo Pool. There was a pool bar at each end, very nice. The other pool was more hip/noisy so we stayed away. The Spa was lovely, as you would expect -- and ridiculously expensive, as you would expect. The only complaint we had was housekeeping. When we arrived into the room, it didn't feel complete, like they had not totally put the room together. This theme continued through our stay, housekeeping was very inconsistent in how they cleaned/prepped the room (sometimes a full set of towels and bath mats/rugs, sometimes not; not always emptying the trash, sometimes not coming at all.) It was odd, considering the caliber of the hotel. We did share this feedback in a survey we received when we got home. We would absolutely recommend the Cosmopolitan, there is something for everyone -- young and hip, or older (like us! ;-) ",0,0,0,0,1

 My mom and I stopped here after reading the yelp reviews while prowling for a good spot to eat. We were pleasantly surprised and happy to find that they were open Sunday evening, since it seemed to be a smaller restaurant. The customer service was fantastic. My mom and I split an order of 5 rolled tacos and a carnitas plate, which was more than enough for 2 people. Both dishes were fantastic, and we were both pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. We spent about $17 with drinks, but it was well worth it; we'll definitely be back! ",0,0,0,1,0

 This Giant Eagle seems more like a GetGo than an actual supermarket. As soon as you get in you want to get out as quickly as possible. You don't want to do any major grocery shopping here. For one, the prices are high. Secondly, this Giant Eagle does not carry everything you need. Who has time to run to another store? Just get your basic necessities here. As for produce, it can be awful at times. Whenever I go to Giant Eagle Market District down the street, the produce is fresh and smells invigorating. However, at Shakespeare, you are bound to find produce with wrinkles, open areas, mold and fruit flies- being sold at the same high prices. I can go to Trader Joe's and find much better produce for less. A pet peeve of mine is the self-checkout lines. Two of them are express lanes for items less than 12; the other lane has a belt if more than 12 items are being purchased. There should be TWO LINES but for some reason customers want to form one long super line, which holds up everything. The staff rarely sorts this out. The customer service is average here and I don't expect it to get any better. I only go here if I have to grab one or two items. The best times to go are early in the morning or late at night.

 Ahh yes Veloce. This is one of my Sunday hangouts in the evening. I've taken dates here and I've gone solo just because I'm awesome enough to do that. Let me start by saying the view is amazing. Your 16 stories up on an already elevated part of Las Vegas, Blvd, except you're in Henderson. There's also an outside patio for those of you who like a little air or want to have a cigar/cigarette after dinner. The entire restaurant is just surrounded by windows that actually serve as the wall. The actual ambiance is great like I said for taking a member of the fairer sex here. The foods a tad bit pricey, typically $25-45 a plate, but so what, it's quite good. If you're a serious sushi connoisseur then you'll probably find better spots in Vegas like I Love Sushi, Sin City Sushi, or Yummy Grill Sushi to name a few, but that's not to say the stuff here is bad by any means. I think if they work on their menu a bit and work on their signature rolls, it will add to the rest of the menu that's currently more functional. The Steak is outstanding. I usually get the peppercorn steak that's already sliced when it gets to you. It's got an amazing sauce on it along with peppercorns obviously. It's served with french fried onions and I usually pair this with a nice Chardonnay of some kind. They go great together. Surprisingly, I don't think many people know about this spot because it's a ways away from the strip a little past Southpoint on St Rose. But if you're a local and are looking to really have a nice evening somewhere with someone new or someone you want to show a good time to, this is the spot to head to. Even sitting at the bar is an experience. If you do happen to sit at the bar upon your arrival here, tell Nino that Dominic sent ya. He takes outstanding care of his clientel and will assist you with whatever your needs happen to be, including food recommendations and wine pairings. Enjoy. P.S.- The employees are dressed up here, but you really can come casual if you like. In the summertime you'll catch me here in a tshirt, shorts and sandals having wine and filet mignon. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I used to like Paradise Bakery a lot more than I do now. They've changed their menu a bunch, and while I appreciate a menu that isn't stagnant, I found myself just staring at their chalk boards unable to find something that sounded appealing. I ended up selecting their avocado Cobb salad and it came with like three chunks of avocado. My full size salad and a medium sized mediocre iced coffee drink ran me almost $15 after tax. Not impressed. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've been going to this place for the past 15 years and it's definitely gone downhill recently. I used to rave about the food and service to all my friends, but recently my experiences have been pretty terrible. The owner and his waitstaff look as if they have just given up, there's never a smile on anyone's face, they all just look depressed. The food used to be amazing, but it seems as if they must have changed chefs because now everything usually ends up coming out either over done, or just drenched in way too much sauce. If you complain about the food, the waitstaff just acknowledge the complaint with a nod, walk away, and do nothing about it. I hate to write a bad review because I know how great it used to be, but it just seems as if owner stopped caring. ",0,1,0,0,0

The sushi rolls are HUGE and we always wind up ordering too much. My favorite thing about this place is to sit at the bar and let the sushi chefs create something for me.

 So, I'm already a big fan of Bachi Burger as I've visited their Windmill location numerous times. What prompted me to visit this location was based on the last three unsuccessful experiences I had at the other location -- hour-long waits and unhelpful individuals. I almost gave up on Bachi Burger, even though that would have hurt me more than it hurt them. One evening, my friend and I remembered their Summerlin location and fortunately, it was approximately the same distance from our homes, so we decided to give them chance. Our experience was wonderful from start to finish. There was no other parties waiting and we were approached immediately. After checking in with us, we were told that it would be 5-10 minutes (though a little odd since, again, there was no one waiting and half the restaurant was empty tables). We were just happy that it wasn't 45-60 minutes! However, before we could even get comfortable with a Seven magazine, we were escorted to our table with a sincere apology (for the wait) from the hostess. We told her, ""Don't be ridiculous, we hardly waited!"" Our server was friendly and attentive; we were so delighted. I went with my usual Spicy Miso Burger and Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries. All very, very delicious. For dessert, I opted for a boba milk tea drink. I couldn't decide between Almond and Taro Coconut, so our server recommended a blend of the two, exclaiming that it was her favorite drink! Of course, I had to and it was delicious. I'm definitely coming back, however, to this location only and hopefully they don't let their popularity get to their heads like their sister location. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have been an infrequent but long-term customer of Cactus Flower since the early 1990's. Last year I had unsatisfactory experiences with one of the shops, but decided to give the Phoenix shop a try. Good decision, for the one order they delivered. I stopped in yesterday to order for V Day. A somewhat distracted employee tossed a couple tattered catalog pages on the table for me to choose from, and described a few. When I asked that it be delivered by the time the recipient leaves work, she said school delivery was before 2, and businesses by 5 PM. Since the recipient leaves work by 3, I asked that she be included in the ""school"" delivery. No can do, policy is policy! It came down to a quick but clearly evident battle of wills between the young employee and me, she wasn't going to budge, and I wasn't going to risk the order being late. So I voted with my dollars, 150 of them, and took my business elsewhere. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I could have done almost all of my Christmas shopping here. Well - I did a good bit of it here as it was. Mom got a real turquoise bracelet - about 2- to 2 1/2 inches wide and turquoise earrings. (Bracelet 9.95, Earrings 3.95). Brothers got hand carved Buddha statue, set of those balls you roll in your hand in the little silk box w/ dragons on them and a Dragon carved necklace. (9.95, 3.95 and 2.95 respectively). Got the brother's girlfriend a few bracelets - in her favorite colors as there are just about any colors to chose from - and an anklet (4.95 for bracelet and 1.95 for anklet). Also got mom a stocking stuffer of petrified wood for a few bucks. She loved it, but then again, she's into that kind of thing. I was tempted to buy myself some of their cultured pearl necklaces, again in several colors (not sure how I feel about that) for like $8 but I held back. Some of my almost boughts included wooden chimes, African drums, beautiful wood carvings and these incredible handmade notebooks of all sizes filled with handmade paper. All of it is relatively inexpensive. Yea - some of it looks cheap - but most of it doesn't. Enjoy some of the cool world music while you shop. Take a few moments to really look around and I'm sure you'll find something to catch your eye. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Always been fan of Bachi Burger so hearing about this newer version but still the same owners! Excited! Bookmarked for sometime just never got around to it. The irony is Bachi HLK is literally five minus from my house. I never really noticed it. Yay its off busy street Rainbow but not looking you never think about tit. I found the perfect excuse check it off bookmark. Recovery meal! Not only recovery meal (the best meal of the day) with my favorite yelper/triathlon warriors in my life. Suzy H and Terri R. We hit Bachi HLK for lunch after solid swim workout in the pool. Terri been here before the rest of us first timers. My first impressions was really really nice interior decor of healthy restaurant. Not that breakfast joint or lunch spots lack class. Bright earth tone color scheme all around so walking in kind of brightens your day. Lol! I find it relaxing. It refreshing change from the darker look of the Bachi Burgers. Special boards on the back wall when you walk in. So always keep eye out for it and see if anything jumps at you. The food I started with order of beignets. I would say it was ok. I liked the outside was crispy, nice coating of power sugar, and one of the thing about classic beignet get your fingers sugar coated with every bite. It lacked is the inside was moist but little dense and just not fluffy or light true beignets. The sauce the strawberry guava got nothing but rave things about. I could take bottle of that home for all thing toasted nice spread on top. The other two sauces felt was ok. Overall tried the beignet by itself then with the sauces. Nothing wow about it. Entree ordered the breakfast sandwich.I always harp sandwich is only as good as the bread. The ciabatta bread was on point!!!! It had the nice crust and moist/hot on the inside. Love the fact the bacon was cooked crispy perfection not greasy. Add the eggs any style you want its literally the perfect breakfast of champions all wrapped up in sandwich. Best part about eating with yelpers is sharing is caring. I fortunate enough too try some of the banana bread. I thought was ok. Not sure the muffins tried but nothing that made lasting impact for me. Pastry fell short but maybe ordered or tried the wrong ones. The service was excellent. I am fan of new version of Bachi. More then thrilled that its so close my house. It nice diverse menu of breakfast items, lunch, and not all the things are healthy on the menu. So if want substance you can find it here at Bachi HLK. I will be coming back. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Been looking all over the Valley for someone to do cupcakes for a wedding. This place has the best cupcakes so far!! Lots of choices. I loved the Chi and tuxedo flavors. Soooo good. The Chi really did taste like a creamy, sweet, strongly brewed chi!! The tuxedo was a rich and moist chocolate cake & a very flavorful vanilla cake topped with a whipped cream icing and chocolate drizzle. My boyfriend liked the Mint cupcake. It had a very strong mint flavor with a chocolate fudge icing and fudge filling. We bought a 1/2 dozen to take home and try. Each cupcake is a larger than average size. We split each one in half in order to sample as many flavors as possible. We enjoyed each and every one. The flavor of each cupcake is recognizable by taste and smell. All are moist and have the right ratio of icing, cake, and filling. Honestly, its not just the flavors that sold me. If I'm going to buy cupcakes rather than just make them myself, I want them to be: Larger than average Decorated nicer than I would have been able to do myself Have interesting flavors Fancy and elegant looking Most other places just sell regular size, regularly decorated cupcakes. Caketini cupcakes have everything I'm looking for. My only criticism is that they could step up the cake decoration / presentation a little (Mind over Batter in Tempe has pretty / fancy / elegant decorations on their cupcakes). If your just looking for treats (not a wedding caterer) Caketini is the best. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I likely drive by 3 yogurt shops to get to Yogurtology. And it's well worth the drive. With so many yogurt shops popping up, you might notice the formula: someone buys a franchise, they order their flavors from the same vendor, have the same toppings, hire a couple 16 year olds, yada yada. You been to one, you been to many. Product Quality: Yogurtology has turned the competition up a couple notches: the assortment of toppings is incredible- it's the only place I know of that has baklava as an ice cream topper. The fresh fruit is plentiful and beautifully fresh. The yogurt flavors are spectacular, so you will definitely have some serious decision making to do. Atmosphere: Spotlessly clean- i think that they hire one person just to clean, vacuum, and wipe down. The help is very friendly and forthcoming- they must seek out gregarious employees, or train their employees to be outgoing and helpful. There is seating inside and outside. I hope this place is around for a good long time! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I want to curse everyone I know who recommended this craptacular buffet. I don't even know where to start. First, my husband and I just got married on Saturday and this was our first dinner after getting hitched. Everyone told us that the Wynn is where it's at. It's the hottest buffet in town! Yeah! Second, NO IT IS NOT. It's absurdly overpriced at more than $50 a person for dinner. What do you get for that princely sum? *Some cold crab legs (it's NOT King Crab, either, despite what others are saying) *Shrimp cocktail (several of which weren't even deveined. GROSS. Shrimp poop does not go with prime rib) * A bunch of other unremarkable crap you can find at any other buffet on the Strip. Third, the interminable WAIT. We waited for an hour, thinking it would be worth it. We're suckers. The prime rib was decent, however, and there was some really good mushroom risotto. But those two things in no way justify the price or the wait or the raves this place gets. The only thing that could have made our experience worse is if we had coughed up the extra $12 to skip the line. This only confirms my belief that the nicest hotels don't necessarily have the nicest buffets - the Bellagio buffet is no great shakes, either. Stick with the Rio or Paris and you can't lose. Now, who do I see to get my $50 and my 60 minutes back? ",1,0,0,0,0

 While I want to love this place, everything about it is just mediocre. It's a long ways from the Serendipity in NYC. While the inside is cute in some ways and what you come to expect from a traditional ice cream parlor, it seriously lacks ambiance. It is just a little too bright, a little too sparse, not quite clean enough, way too busy, and too many screaming children. The wait here can be insanely ridiculous at times. And the wait isn't really worth it. Come back when it's not so busy. Personally, I prefer to dine outside. While service always seems to be slower outside, it is good people-watching and just a better experience overall. The food is good. I've never had anything bad. I've also never had anything crave-worthy or exceptional. One of the best things here is the wings. Definitely one of the better places in Vegas for hot wings. Very meaty and good quality wings. Lots of sauce with just the right thickness and spice (sauce has a hint of cinnamon too). Excellent blue cheese sauce for dipping. The hot dog, mac 'n' cheese, etc. are all good. Again, never had anything bad. But none of it really stands out either. And while one could justify the prices because the portions are huge, it still just all seems way over-priced. They have a great list of sundaes and other desserts. And all have been good. But there's nothing great about any of them. The ice cream isn't anything great, their hot fudge sauce isn't anything different from anywhere else, etc. Skip the cocktails. While they mostly all sound good, none of them are actually good. Mediocre. Everything is just fine, but nothing is great. That specialness and uniqueness and sense of magic that you experience at Serendipity in NYC just isn't here in Serendipity Vegas. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Hubby and I were super excited try this place. We had heard great things about it. We bought a groupon back in May for it. We decided when we got there to order one lunch entree and one breakfast and share. Hubby got corn beef hash breakfast with fried egg and pancakes and an apple fritter. I got the chicken fried steak lunch with a salad with ranch. We also each got a maple iced coffee. My salad came out first, looked ok, started eating it and like 6-7 pieces of the lettuce were brown, slimy and rotten looking. Kinda grossed me out and I only ate a couple bites. The ranch was good...but not amazing like the waitress said. Food came out and looked ok. The chicken fried steak was good but NO Texas chicken fried steak and the gravy was yellow...what the heck??? Came with barely toasted bread and nasty frozen mixed veggies, hubby's food was just ok. The eggs weren't cooked right, and the pancakes were just ok. The corn beef hash was ok. Overall....NOT impressed. We used our groupon and will never go back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This restaurant definitely has a special place in my heart. The food is ono and reminds me so much of home. The island music and ""aloha spirit"" shared by the employees is definitely an A+ in my book. The ahi poke was tender and the right consistency. As for my favorite dish, the furikake chicken, it tastes so amazing and very unique. It reminds me of the chicken served at The Alley or Queen Street Cafe back home in Aiea, Oahu. The food is served in good sized portions and you get a good bang for your buck. Easily now one of my favorite places to go to for Hawaiian food in town. I highly recommend this place! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Sometimes you tire of various types of food and sometimes nothing but a hot dog will do. I live in the S.F. Bay Area, was visiting in Tempe and had one of those afternoons when I wanted nothing but a hot dog. I got the foot long and it tasted good, but next time I'll try the all-beef which my wife had. The kitchen is well-maintained and the self-service is efficient, even with a line 20 deep. The grill uses charcoal. Although I didn't order any fries or onion rings, they looked good and Ted's also touts real ice cream milkshakes. The only minor downgrade I have is that the location is in a strip mall and it just lacks a traditional hot dog stand feel to it. It's clean, but maybe just a little too clean. Otherwise, very good... ",0,0,0,1,0

 Before you come here, lets get the most important thing out of the way. GET YOURSELF THE ROSETTA STONE KOREAN LANGUAGE LEARNING PROGRAM OR BRING SOMEONE THAT SPEAKS KOREAN! Apparently, these guys are trying to be so authentic that they hired Korean staff that hardly speaks any english. I asked for a fork and dude says, ""You want spicy pork?"" I said yes because I love spicy pork but at the same time I really wanted a fork because I am chopstick challenged. I dont have any patience to use that crap. Anyways, I came here because of their grand opening special of AYCE bbq 12.95 for lunch and 15.95 for dinner. Add 5 dollars more if you want AYCE sushi with that. Come August 1st its going up to 20.95 for lunch and 25.95 for dinner. The 5 dollar sushi AYCE sushi option still applies. Keep in mind that you pick out what you want on the menu and they bring it out to you on plates. It's not like Sura where you get up and get whatever you want and bring it back to your table. We ordered Short Ribs, Brisket, Bulgogi, Pork Belly, and Chicken. The short ribs and Barbequed Steak (which they were out of) are only available for dinner. All that we ordered was really good except for the chicken which was kind of dry. Besides the language barrier as the first major disappointment, im sorry to say that there were more to add to it. One was the parking or should I say lack there of. The parking lot is small and the spaces are narrow. Dont be surprised if your car has a few more dings or dents when you come out to leave. I recommend parking on the street. Next, the grills they have you use are gold colored and are not designed properly. When cooking fatty foods like Pork Belly, there is no place for all the excess oil to drain except the sides of the grill where they can catch fire. Ours did and we had to turn off the fire so they can extinguish the flames. One of the bussers came up and sprayed some kind of all purpose cleaner to put the fire out but it caused it to flare up and almost burn our faces. Im glad I didnt get burned or there would have been a severe lawsuit pending. All they could say was, ""Oh, sorry"". From that point on, our server would come by and mop up any excess oil off the grill with napkins. Really? I dont ever recall any Korean Bbq joint doing this. I would also like to mention that they have these crystal grills that you can use as well. We were not offered this option and would have turned it down anyway because of my friends that tried it several days ago said it sucked. Some random info: Hours are 11 am to 12 midnight every day. Lunch is from 11 to 3 pm. Dinner is 3 pm to closing (12 midnight). Makes me wonder if you can sneak in right at 2:45 to get charged lunch price and get dinner items. If you try it and it works, let me know. Lol. Also, dont eat here if you are wearing nice clothes or are planning to go to a nice or formal event. The smoke from the barbeque stays in your hair and clothes. I made the mistake of eating at a Korean barbeque restaurant right before going to a graduation ceremony. Everybody was looking around wondering if somebody was barbequeing somewhere close by and ironically thats what people wanted to eat for dinner as soon as the event ended. So in closing, I suggest that if you wanna try this place out, bad service and all, now would be the time because of the promo price. Then, you can decide if its worth any future trips when they charge regular price. For me that's a negative captain.

 If Macy's sends out an ad in the Sunday paper shouldn't they have the items in which they are selling in the store? Well not this Macy's. I am moving (insert a very huge, happy dance right here) and was in love with a Calvin Klein bedding set which was not on display or any trace of even it's existence in the store. LAME. Good thing I felt like blowing a load that night and went with something equally as fresh from Hotel Collection. You can't beat the quality. I also bought bath towels I love. Did a Sales Associate help me? HELL NO. I think her husband must have punched her in the head too many times because she was just off. Sales Ass- ""How's the weather over there?"" Me- ""Over where?"" Sales Ass just points to the exit doors like a toddler who is still learning how to form words. Me- ""You mean outside?"" Sales Ass- ""Yes"" Me- ""Oh, I thought you meant on the moon. Ha ha. It's gorgeous out. What's my total?"" Get me out of here. Yeah, had to share. What's scary is giving someone like that your credit card information in hopes she doesn't mistakenly overcharge the shit on accident while she is drooling on the register. Restrooms: Pet peeve. Why the hell is the restroom located by the Men's jeans? Let's be real. Men ""piss"" on occasion. Women use it more. Women really need the restroom for business or to beautify themselves or to change diapers or beat their children I imagine (which I would never ever do, but I have seen it done in there). Why then is it's location not more convenient for us ladies? Secondly the restroom was a disaster and just seemed old and broken. I'm sure Britney Spears would gladly walk barefoot and eat Cheetos up in there, but I didn't even feel safe breathing! As much as I spent on bedding and towels I shouldn't feel like I'm going Number 1 in a Third World country! Yes, I did wash my hands and no I did not sit on the seat. Get it together Macy's. You have great product when it's available, but you have got to work on your staffing, cleanliness and ads being misleading. If something is only available online or at the Home Store let a sista know. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've been going to Valle Luna ever since I can remember!! They have awesome salsa but not awesome chips. The bean dip is a hit or miss, it depends on who makes it that day. The pollo fundido is my favorite... even though it cost like $15 and an extra $3 for a side of the jalapeno cream cheese. I also recommend the pollo sandwich and the grilled honey-hot wings! Now about the service... it's terrible!!! A lot of the servers have worked at Valle Luna for many years and treat NO ONE with respect. They treat customers like they are an inconvenience then wonder why they don't get good tips lol. ",0,1,0,0,0

 05/05/10 Another great update from the Smokehouse Grill-- the Steak and cheese sandwich (comes w/ your choice of side), one of a few on the daily specials' board. The waffle fries alone would make any meal worth the daily special price, but my pick today was just shoe-dropping good!! The meat was cooked just right- superbly seasoned and had great texture. I love onions best when they're caramelized, and these had a nice bite to it and added just enough sweetness to counteract the saltiness of the cheese. Oh, but don't forget the bread! These had a great crusty exterior and, yet, soft inside... Yum! I want another, please! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've never been to Sardine but when I heard that it was going to be serving traditional japanese food past 6:30 pm, I knew that I had to try it. . As soon as the clock strikes 6:30 p.m., caf \ u00e9 Sardine turns into Iwashi izakaya. Now, for those who are familiar with Sardine know that it's a very small space. Every time I've gone to Iwashi thus far, it's been packed, so that's always a good sign, but you may feel a little bit like a... eeh... sardine in a tin can sitting during their rush (which can last all night, that's how good the food is). Needless to say, despite their small venue, this allows the staff to give more special attention to their guests and for food to arrive relatively soon (it's still a sit down restaurant though, not a fast food one.) Their menu is small but I mean, we're here for the ramens. I went last night and they had added the veggie ramen on there which was as aesthetically pleasing to my eyes as it was to my palette. They have a nice selection of sake. Their beer menu is meek with PBR and Sapporo, but it fulfills that beer need if that's how you roll. They also make specialty cocktails which apparently are delicious (I'm a beer girl) according to my friends who I've gone with. I think anyone will enjoy this restaurant especially if you like japanese food. Great servers, great ambiance, and the food is worthy of a return (I've gone four times so far). Recommended dishes: karage fried chicken with aioli, tonkotsu ramen with pork, tuna tartare, and vegetable ramen. * the vegetarian options are limited so ask your server about their veg options.

 I kept going back, hoping it would be different... but this is the truth: the cupcakes have nothing special about them. For $3.75 each, I would expect them to use ""better"" or gourmet ingredients, but they taste too regular, too sweet, and even.. boring. I would rather cross the street to Sprinkles for a cute, tasty and satisfying $3.25 cupcake. However, they do have a good location for those who need a quick sugar rush while shopping.

 I went into this location for dinner at 6:15 pm. The place was busy and there was a line. I hadn't eaten and even though I felt like leaving, I stayed. After waiting in line for 8-10 minutes, it was my time to order. I placed my order for a steak salad and was immediately told they were out of steak and it would be at least 10 minutes before they would have some. Really? Out of steak, at a Mexican restaurant, at dinner time. This is the 2nd time this has happened to me; the previous time was lunchtime. A manager or supervisor should really explain to their employees how to prepare for rush hour and to make sure this doesn't happen. I can honestly say this has never happened at Saba's or Chipotle! It will be a long time before I go back to this location. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I am sad that I have lived close to Lupie's for more than a year and just in the last month discovered its awesomeness. Lupie's may not have an extensive menu, but the things they have a done well. And it's pretty cheap too. This place looks like a total dive. The outside is a little dated, and for that matter, so is the inside decor. The inside looks kind of like a cabin, with wooden tables, benches, and even paneling on the wall. For me, this place seems very down-home and inviting. Our waitress was sweet as could be, and did a great job waiting on all the tables in the main area. The first time I had Lupie's was for carry-out. My partner was craving nachos, and I wanted a burger. It was the closest place to get both of the things we wanted. The nachos were covered in the choice of chili, and we chose the mild Southern Style. The nachos were absolutely delicious! I had a simple bacon cheeseburger, and the patty was very meaty and flavorful. It was excellent and reasonably priced, and much better than many expensive, gourmet burgers I've had in this city. The second trip, we decided to finally dine it. Our waitress informed us they had just changed the menu that day, and you could now get chili mac over their macaroni and cheese. Oh HECK yeah, I was sold! They added even more cheese (kind of cheesy overload, but I like that sort of thing), onion, and beans to the Cincinnati chili, which was SO good! My partner had the same thing with the Southern chili, and I have to admit that this was even better. However, you may want to bring some Tums and/or Beano with you. It is served with a large square of cornbread, which was also very delicious. Cornbread tends to be a little sweet at most places, but not here. It was a fabulous, moist, savory cornbread, which matched the chili mac perfectly. To drink, we had sweet tea served in mason jars, which was some of the best tea I've had here in Charlotte. And to top off the whole meal, we ordered the sweet potato kuchen for dessert. I admit, I was a little hesitant about the dish when they brought it out completely covered in whipped cream. But for me, it was love at first bite. The cake was served hot, so the cream cooled it down at first and then kind of melted on the top. The cake was so moist, with so much great sweet potato flavor, that it might be my new favorite sweet potato dessert. For two dinners, two teas, and a dessert, our bill came out around $26 + tip, which was pretty inexpensive compared to a lot of places. Our portions were so big, I think I only ate about 1/3 of my food. Both my partner and I had plenty of leftovers to take back and eat later. If you're looking for chili or a burger, I very highly recommend this place. They had some great comfort food for really great prices. Healthy it may not be, but delicious it is! I have a feeling I will be dreaming of that kuchen for the next few days. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is a mixed review with the Mystery Mansion Dinner Theater because it is housed in Coco's. I went to Coco's on Friday, August 12 for the Mystery Mansion Bedside Manor dinner the show. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. We were seated at the table furthest from the stage where most of the show took place. I won't even post any of the pictures I wasted time taking because I was always too far away or behind the actors. Not good! I paid extra for the salmon. Big mistake. It was way overcooked, hard and tasted like tuna fish. I had two small bites. I asked my friend how a person can burn broccoli and she answered, ""The same way they burn carrots."" Burned over-steamed vegetables. Really? The tossed salad in the little cup that kept spilling out as I tried to stab a piece of lettuce with my fork.,and part of the overheated, dry baked potato were the only part of the meal I ate. Bummer. Over all the night was a big disappointment for the money paid. The jokes were corny and the accents difficult to understand. Pete Swartz (female)made it bareable. She was very good in all of her roles so kudoos to her for make the night bareable. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Very disappointing. When we got there, a couple was walking by and the lady was giving the thumbs down when she passed the restaurant. We asked them why and they said that it was not worth going there. We should have believed her... I know spanish food and my wife is from Spain - and this restaurant was not even seriously trying to be spanish. Rectangular croquetas so dry that you need the wierd sauce that goes with to eat them? Tortilla de patatas which was a thick slice of some potato and egg cake with onions nowhere to be seen? One more thing. Iru \ u00f1a is the Basque name for the city of Pamplona (where the bull run takes place in the streets every year), which is in spanish Basque Country. But when you enter the restaurant, you see a huge mural of the Sagrada Familia which is in Barcelona - in Catalu \ u00f1a, not Basque Country. Somebody had their landmarks mixed up... In summary: bad food and the ambiance is cold. Not at all what you would expect from a so-called Basque restaurant. A place to avoid. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I was a bit skeptical about this place when it first opened up, but when my normal oil change place fell through on me this place came to my rescue. Pretty much drive in, you wait in your car while it get serviced so you don't have to get out at all. They do offer you snacks and refreshments. I was still freaked out that someone was working on my car while I was still inside of it, maybe I thought I would accidentally hit the gas and hurt someone [ so no refreshments for me ]. Overall my stay there was about 10min - they had me fixed up and going in no time. Will I come back? Probably. I will probably not wait until the final hour of my oil to change it though - just one of those things that is important to keep up with since we depend on our vehicles a lot to make it through the day.

 Wow! I'm stunned at the high average rating of this place. It found this place mediocre, and quite disappointing. The fellas and I went to Vegas for the weekend and got three suites here. The rooms weren't bad, but they certainly didn't ""wow"" me with their plush-ness. The worst thing about them was how dark they were. The walls were painted dark grey, and all the interior design was similarly color-themed. No matter how many lights were on, and with all the blinds open, the room was still dreary. The buffet was good. Props for that. The Brazilian BBQ at Rum Jungle was a letdown. See my review of Espetus in San Francisco for what Brazilian BBQ should be. At Rum Jungle, the food was okay, but the experience wasn't what it should have been. Rather than pick your own side dishes from a serve-yourself salad bar, the waiters decided what side dishes were coming, in what quantity, and how fast. Hardly the self-gorging experience Brazilian BBQ should be. Same with the meats. The last straw happened when I went to hit the gym one morning. I walked up and was told ""there is a $20 fee for hotel guests to use the gym."" My head spun around. That's right, $20 for PAYING GUESTS to lift weights. Call me crazy, but I think that if an activity costs the hotel nothing, it should cost the guest nothing. Outrageous. Wait it gets better. I grudgingly forked over 20 bucks, and thought: this is likely to be the nicest gym I have ever been in. There will probably be strippers handing me my weights. Holy nope. This facility was a POS. I have been in nicer gyms in crappy apartment complexes. The whole place was probably 1000 square feet, with only 400 square feet devoted to weights. The place was lit by very dim fluorescent lights. Flattering. There was no free weight bench press. WTF? Talk about standard equipment! I was pissed the whole time, and I had a shitty workout as a result. I had dropped $250 in the casino that weekend, but that $20 hurt way worse. In the end, I protested to the front desk, and without contest, they reimbursed me my $20, so that was good. Overall, this place is mediocre at best. I will choose to stay somewhere else next time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Have to give a shout out to this place. Although I have only gone to ""Cocktails"" a few times in the last few years, it will always have a special place in my heart. Flash back 25 years ago. My Dad used to take me here for happy hour with his work buddies. Some may say that isn't good parenting. Maybe its not. But I have very fond memories of sitting up at the bar getting my cheeks pinched by the bartender and the patrons. The nice, smoky voiced, wrinkly blond female bartender would put a zillion maraschino cherries in my shirley temple. And I would play darts with my Daddy. I feel warm and fuzzy just thinking about it. Once I would hit adulthood I would stop in every so often. Though my life was constantly changing this bar just felt like home. Another warm fuzzy memory? My brother proposed to his amazing wife here on New Years Eve a few years ago. I wasn't there at the time, but he text me pictures after the proposal.

 This review is for Saturday night on Labor Day weekend, 2014. Our server Paul (if I remember correctly) was funny and attentive. We arrived at 6PM with a 645 reservation. When we arrived at 6, the lady said there was a wedding rehearsal dinner in the patio until 8 but would willingly give us a table out there if they finished early. Luckily their rehearsal ended around 7pm and we were given a table outside for 6. The reservation was for my parents 30th anniversary and we really wanted the patio table. I previously read how hard it was to get one so in the end it was so worth it because the view and ambiance was just outstanding. We ordered the beef carpaccio and smoked salmon flatbread for appetizers and the beef carpaccio was AMAZING.. I had the mushroom pappardelle and it was a little on the heavy side but aside from that--it tasted on the good average side. My dad had the mushroom risotto added on to his steak. Let me tell you--I love risotto! The texture was good, tasted cheesy and made pretty well. The lamb lollipop was amazing. Tender, soft and tasty. It was made RIGHT. We also ordered the Chilean sea bass and my brother in law had no complaints. Said it was good. In the end of our dinner, our server brought out a couple of mini choux with ""happy anniversary"" written in beautiful hand writing. My parents loved the dinner and enjoyed the show. Took many breathtaking pictures with the fountain show. But I got to say--if it wasn't for the patio seating granting us a good view of the fountain show, I would probably not return since the taste was a little above average but not good enough to be this overpriced. I enjoyed dinner at Olives and would definitely come back again (for the view) BUT, i do have some cons: 1) When I called to make a reservation, the lady on the phone was pretty rude rushing me off the phone just because I asked if they do floral arrangement for dinner and asked her for patio seating &she said ""let me tell you..when you get here you ask for patio. If you want flowers ask concierge."" She was trying to be nice for the sake of her job but I can tell from her tone of voice that she wanted me off the phone ASAP. 2) Patio seating should be reservable. It would take a lot less effort for customers so customers would not have to worry if they would be able to get a patio seat for special occasions. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This place is my favorite!! The setup is fantastic! If you're a girl be sure to have a promoter get you on the guest list! You will have a separate line, free entrance, as well as 1-2 drink tickets! -Sunday swim is LOTS of fun! -You can find places to sit even if you do not have table service. -Awesome DJ's! -Indoor, outdoor, upstairs -Pool! -Don't require you to buy bottled water!

 You don't need a view when your room is this big. The secrecy of Hotwire deals in ""downtown Pittsburgh"" is a situation. Their perimeter crosses into the Southside and whatever you call north of The Point across the bridge. And when you cross reference the hotels in that area on Yelp with the providers on Hotwire, you can end up in very different situations. Then, you can research the Omni price -- $190 regularly -- against the Hotwire deal $120 and it's worth the risk. Large room. Large king bed. Large room service 24 hour menu. Large hallways. Wander them. If you're looking to pull an Aaron Sorkin in a random American city and stay in a hotel without leaving for 24 to 144 hours straight, this is your place in Pittsburgh. The expansive lobby gives you enough fresh air. The front desk staff is simple & accommodating. If you're the type to leave the hotel then it's a decent location. Just know there isn't a decent bar within 5 blocks, and you're only decent walkable option is to jaunt over to Market Square. But if it's summer time and you want to walk to PNC park for a game or the Heinz museum, it's a perfect option. Also, robes. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ok, here we go again. You wash your hands, but they only have those stupid air blowers that take forever to try & dry them, so you go for ass gaskets instead. There is a dispenser but it's empty, so you spend a while back at the air blower. Then you go (with your still damp hands) for toilet paper to open the door with, because it has a latch & you'd like to leave the bathroom with you hands cleaner than when you entered!

 I got to admit this convention center has a great view of the river! Most centers don't have a view at all, so I was very impressed with this one! As far as convention centers go, this one was roomy, easy to navigate, and very clean! They even had accessible outdoor locations for those wanting to smoke (which I don't condone) or those just needing some fresh air (which I do condone.) The only down side I had to this convention center was the waterfall in the middle of the road, under the overpass, beneath the convention center. The echo of the falling water made it very hard to hear yourself let alone the people you're walking with. Overall great location, easy to walk to from many parts of downtown Pittsburgh, and one of the better convention centers I've been to. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I am not too sure how to put half a star but that's what I would give them. My son went in there today and was treated very rudely. With no budget, he went in with cash in hand for a great stereo. When he began asking questions about installation and time frames, the little man that helped him said, ""If you are not going to get it installed, stop waisting my time. Go home! "" My husband and I have been there too and we were not even aknowledged. They walked right past us and helped the person behind us. We gave them the benefit of the doubt, however, after this incident they will never ever get our business. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I really wanted to like this place.. It is trendy place with a good vibe. But.... While the service was great the food was average at best. I got Shrimp and Grits, the presentation was awesome but the food lacked flavor, the shrimp were medium sized and the grits were awful, clumpy and tasted instant. For the price ... My expectations were much, much higher. My friend got the hash and again looked nice but once you dug in... All you got was very expensive fried potatoes. Not sure I will give them another chance.. Their prices are just to high to get average food. ",0,0,1,0,0

 As much as I respect Michael C.'s reviews, I'm not going to give Grazie 4 - 5 stars just because. The last time my wife and I visited Grazie, we received terrible, unattentive service, and a soggy, less-than-tasty Margherita pizza. And I'm not trying to exaggerate either - we actually wanted to send the pizza back. I love the idea of a small, nearby, locally owned pizzeria like Grazie, so we'll probably try going there again. The atmosphere is just what I want a dinner place - dark and intimate - but they have to have good food and service, too. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have very mixed feelings about the Arrogant Butcher. Four visits on varying occasions have each resulted in different experiences and levels of satisfaction. I love the atmosphere and the overall experience, but the lack of consistency is noticeable and I have heard similar criticisms from friends. My first trip to AB was for drinks and a snack during a break from a sporting event downtown. I went over alone (to escape) ordered a Manhattan and an appetizer. The Manhattans were perfect (who stops at one?), and the charcuterie and cheese were terrific and served with some unique accoutrements. However, it was some time before I was able to order that first drink, and in fact, almost left after waiting at the bar for quite some time without acknowledgement - and there were only about 5 other patrons nearby. Once I did get someone's attention, everything was brilliant, but I can never understand a bartender not promptly taking a drink order. My succeeding trip was very similar to the first, waited at the bar with a friend for an inordinate amount of time before finally having our drink and order of cheese and some appetizers taken. The restaurant was not particularly busy and the bar staff was sort of milling around chatting rather than trying to make money by serving the two thirsty girls in front of them. Once we had our (very well crafted) beverages in hand, everything went swimmingly. This place does a stand out job of mixology and the bartenders, while less than attentive, do know how to make a great drink. Third visit - dinner date (no worries boys, it didn't go that well): Service was wonderful in the restaurant and I wish I could recall the waiter's name. We ordered a couple appetizers again went for charcuterie and cheese. The stand out for me was the pate - then again, I am always a sucker for pate. My dinner date had a steak and I had the sweet potato tortellini, which was simply wonderful. Fourth visit - birthday party for ten. This was again a super mixed experience. The restaurant seated us in a private room in the back, which was decorated with some very cool photos of Phoenicianicana. I was a little late in arriving so the crew had already devoured several appetizers and a plethora of oysters. From what I heard the mussels were a big hit and they liked the cheese plate as much as I did. The waiter was super nice, answered questions, took our orders and kept everyone's glass full. Dinner was a bit of a mess. Two of the guys ordered steaks with the $18 crab add on for a surf and turf, one filet and one rib eye, both of which came out overcooked. One of the gals ordered the crab, and the waiter came and explained it had 'fallen apart' so they were bringing a new one. They did fix the errors, but it is ever so awkward to have part of your party finished with dinner while others are waiting on theirs to show up. I ordered the scallops and they were perfectly cooked, but I had to bite through sand in about half of them, which is just a bummer. After we'd already had so many issues I didn't want to add to the aggravation in sending something else back to the kitchen. The GM did come see us, apologized and brought out a round of deserts. In a nice effort he brought two of each of the four desserts on the menu, which we all tried out. The stand out for me was the salted caramel pudding. No one really understood the warm peanut butter gelato, which essentially tasted like peanut butter soup. We were having a good time and we did appreciate the manager and waiter's efforts to apologize and take care of the issues. The Arrogant Butcher has a pretty sweet little happy hour menu and now that my office is now less than ten minutes away, I will probably be stopping back in to check that out and am certain I will eat here again. I just wish they could regularly be as great as I know they can be. ",0,0,1,0,0

 It's surprising how long it took me to get here, then I hear a rumor they're moving soon anyway! Geez... way to be behind the times Rachel! I've been interested in a bunch of the nights they've hosted before, but have never made way way over. I went to celebrate one Miss Aja J's birthday for Hip Hop vs House night. I'm a big hip hop fan, but not much into house. They had two dueling DJ's and an MC hosting the event. I actually liked the mash up of the two genre's. It was definitely better than just house. They have about 5 beers on tap, which I think is impressive for a ""club."" Especially different since it was much more than Miller Light. They actually had a Pumpkin brew on tap, which forgive me for not remember, I was into! At $5.50 it wasn't breaking the bank, but it wasn't a $3 Miller Light fo sho! We came a little early, but it seemed like the night really started to pick up around 11pm. Yep, I'm old, I left at 11pm. Lame, I know! I hope they find a new home, because I think it's a place we don't have anywhere else and I'm happy to have been finally! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I admit their food is great, and it's a cool place to hang out. However, maybe this is due to some of the recent fame and attention that they've received but their attitude towards customers have changed! My friend and I went in, hoping to enjoy their yummy food, but once we stepped in, no one greeted us. And about 2-3 minutes of awkwardly standing around in this tiny restaurant, a man came to us and said: ""You're probably not going to be able to eat here, but for how many?"" we replied ""For two please"" then we got the rudest reply I've ever heard, ""Ehhh- Not gonna happen! Sorry""In a very demeaning tone. Anyways, I really do hope their service improves. There is nothing cool about being pretentious to customers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I had gone out on a whim one weeknight after making a last minute reservation. I was pleasantly surprised with the types of appetizers and entrees that they had available; however, for an atmosphere that is not fine dining, they were kind of expensive. Don't let that scare you away from this great find down in the cultural district. I ordered their version of a 'surf & turf', which was a type of an open-faced sandwich that has a crab cake and a small portion of ribeye on the top of it. The crab cake had a lot of breading in it and just fell apart, and the ribeye was not cooked properly. I didn't bother staying for dessert, mainly because I wasn't interested in paying $12+ for desserts that are pretty unoriginal. The one thing I can tell you is that the service was pretty good. For those of you who have never been there, I'd recommend that you go at least once. It strikes me as a place that is very good for a few drinks or maybe a quick dessert after a show at Heinz Hall - but I'd recommend that you take a quick look first before you dive in for the full meal.

 Excellent service, large suites and good location (if you're okay with being off the strip)! My boyfriend and I stayed here this past August for one night. We had just booked the Solitaire Suite, as we planned to spend as much time away from the hotel, exploring Las Vegas - and booked using a deal through TravelZoo. To our surprise, when we arrived we were given a free upgrade because all of the Solitaire suites were occupied - giving us the Strip View Princess Suite. The suite itself was definitely up to standards with many amenities, including what looked to be a fully functional kitchen (if we would have stayed in Vegas longer than a day, we would have definitely used this), a washer and dryer, a huge beautiful washroom with both a shower and whirlpool tub, and a comfortable bed to sleep in. While we didn't have the chance to use any of the perks associated with our suite or the hotel (the pool area did look nice), it provided a perfect spot to have a comfortable sleep and a short (and safe) walk to the strip at a fairly reasonable price.

 Ever since we went to the outlet store in Milpitas, I've been anticipating the new stores opening here (saw the ""coming soon"" stores sign at the Fashion Show mall a few weeks ago). I didn't know about this store until we went to the other one at the Meadows Mall yesterday. I like this set up compared to the Meadows location, though. Before this store came along, this was one of those ""white elephants""; not lasting very long as any one store. Hopefully, this does well here, in the busier side of the mall. This brand marries both classic and trendy styles together, for a fashionable look, appealing to women or men in their 20's and 30's. But you also might see teens and 40-somethings in here too. I would descibe it as the go-to for basics in cotton fabric. The setup is clothing from top to bottom of the store space, but it doesn't feel claustrophobic, though. The prices are pretty good for people on a tight budget. There are open cardigans (lightweight) for $10- a steal, and in black, navy, grey, white, and striped. The lowest priced rack was 2/$15. I spotted a short sleeved cardigan at $44.95- making me want to break my rule for paying full price for clothing (maybe next paycheck?). There was one lady working on the floor- she greeted us. The fitting rooms are in back with mirrors on the doors (great idea!), to the right. I tried on the sweater and walked up to the mirrored door to check on the fit (it looked cute). Hope this brand is here to stay and puts an end to the ""white elephant"" curse. ",0,0,0,1,0

These tricksters will even show you how they do some of their illusions. The bullet trick as the finale always blows my mind, I can't figure out how the hell they do that! After the show, they stick around to shake hands and talk with all the audience members. Go see it! ",0,0,0,0,1

 So after hearing all the hype, my friend and I went and checked out this place for dinner. At the end, I don't believe it was worth it, especially at the prices they charged. I had the Silk Road to drink to start off with, and was rather disappointed in it. It was served in a tiny tea cup that was filled with ice, so the drink got watered down very quickly. Also, the tequila was so overpowering that I could barely taste the jasmine or lemon, and there was absolutely no bite from the chili pepper, which was the main reason I ordered the drink as I like spicy things. Food wise, I had the Tuna steak which was recommended by the waiter as well as the kimchee fried rice. The tuna steak was cooked perfectly, but that is about all the positive that I can say about the dish. It was served covered in a roasted red pepper/basil/ginger/EVOO ""salsa"" and the red peppers and basil just completely overwhelmed what little flavor the tuna had. Couldn't even taste any ginger in the dish whatsoever. Also, the texture on parts of the tuna were off, and so was the flavor. I described it at one point as tasting as if I was eating semi-firm tofu, as it actually had the flavor along with the texture. My friend who was dining with me firmly agreed with my assessment as well, so it wasn't just me. The kimchee fried rice was very meh, and I was disappointed again that there was no kick to it. There was a very strong flavor of dried shrimp in their, which kind of surprised me but not a lot as I know that it can be used in the making of kimchee. Overall though, I've had much better kimchee fried rice, but it was much better once I added some more soy sauce and sriracha to it to actually give it some oomph. I will not bother coming back here to try other things unless someone else is paying. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is what a swank downtown lounge should be: Excellent service even on a busy Saturday night. Martinis made perfectly. Cheerful accommodation of special requests. Suitably swank architecture and decor (and patrons). I'm very glad I finally made it down to sample Hanny's, which was for years a men's clothing store, not a department store as some seem to believe. I brought along a party of international colleagues who were hooked on Merc Bar from a prior visit. I wanted them to try something new. As we approached the entrance and opened the door, there was a collective sigh bordering on a gasp. This was exactly what the doctor ordered.

You can't even tell what holiday it is when walking in and I myself want to feel the spirit of whatever time of year it is. C'mon it might make me spend more.

 While this place is undergoing a *much* needed renovation, I didn't experience the nice, new part of the hotel. We were housed in a depressingly dingy 'suite' with a stairwell & elevator that smelled overwhelmingly of urine, and a room that had been cleaned by a person with long, dark hair as evidenced by what was left in the bathroom. Admittedly I was not there to stay in the room, but the overall feel of the unrenovated side of the Trop was pretty depressing. The worst part was they charged Bellagio prices at the bars, which seems pretty inauthentic given the decor. Even with the rate we got for Rollercon, it wasn't worth it. Go elsewhere. Really.

 The price range is reasonable; Damon's charged about the same for a rack of ribs, and they're a sports bar. If you're complaining on the price, you're looking for a ribs joint in the ghetto, which this certainly isn't. The price is high (sides are separate), but not ludicrous. The appetizers were spot-on; beans, cornbread, mac & cheese, coleslaw; these are all perfect. But the ribs and fried chicken we had were bad. The most expensive things on our bill weren't good; the main courses weren't any good. It took about twenty minutes for our food to come out, which is a bad sign at a BBQ joint; usually, the food is cooked for hours, but they should be able to serve it up quick at that point. My girlfriend had half a fried chicken, and we debated sending it back when it hit the table. It had been in the fryer waaaay too long, and the outside of everything was burned. It looked burned and blackened. It tasted burned. Ugh. In my case, I had a rack of ribs. It was undersmoked; they weren't slow-cooked all the way through. To make up for that, it looked like they'd grilled the hell out of it for those twenty minutes, and burned all of the outside of the ribs. Edible, but not delicious. The wait staff we worked with seemed very new at this. They were perfectly fine waitstaff for a ribs place, but to make it upscale - and sell $10+ drinks! - the wait staff needs a bit more practice and polish. Having a coat rack or coat hook or some place to put a coat in winter was also a strangely missing touch. On the plus side, all of that is fixable, and I'll head back in six months to a year, but man, there are some bugs to work out here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We live less than a mile away and elected to try Tides again, since we received a Station Casinos coupon for Tides. First off, the food is not too bad and we had no complaints. The bad news was our server. She failed to listen when we wanted to order our entrees, despite an appetizer order made at first. When she did return, she asked if I wanted a second beer, which I clearly told her yes. Well, 15 minutes elapse and I began to monitor our servers movements. It was no busier than most restaurants and I could sense that I was forgotten. I had to wave the hostess over. I advised that my drink never arrived and I had no water, despite my meal arriving. Despite my frustrations, I eventually let the server know when she asked if everything was ok. Now the excuses and attitude came out and all this did was to make me more frustrated. The Sous Chef was sent our way for my complaint. He was gracious and took my name and number, advising that he wanted us to be happy and return. He said I would be contacted. Three days later, no call. BTW, I refused to use the coupon which would make this visit look like poor folks looking for a cheap meal. Also, I have never made a restaurant complaint in my life and typically am forgiving if there is a sincere effort. In this case, I'm still steaming about the server's attitude and poor service.

 I wouldn't go to this restaurant when there are plenty of other options on the strip that has better service and higher quality food. We went here base on yelp reviews and I must say it was a disappointment. I order the beef hash and eggs with a side of bacon. My friend ordered the sirloin with eggs. Five minutes later they brought out the side of bacon before our drinks and the food. We had to send it back because it was ridiculous to just sat there and stare at the side of bacon. My friend streak was bland and tasteless, my beef-hash was mediocre nothing special. At the end we both agreed that only the French fries was decent. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Had the ""Boite Surprise"" (""Surpise Box"") which I'm told used to be called the ""Choix du Chef"" (""Chef's Choice"") and it did not disappoint. It indeed was a surprise. I guess they changed the name so any disappointed customers wouldn't blame the Chef. Quarter chicken leg meal... more like a QUARTER BOX meal since the piece was so small, that's how much space it took up in the take out container, which by the way contained a tray that was tapered at the bottom. Found the chicken to be saltier than other roast chicken places. Maybe they marinate it in brine before roasting. The downside is that salt is its predominant flavour. The fries were crispy and actually not bad. Switched the salad for an extra gravy which I didn't really need but this man needs meat, not salad, and he got neither. Still, for those with decent appetites or meat lovers, pay for the more expensive chicken breast meal instead. After all, there's no time to eat lunch twice. Overall, something different from the Swiss Chalet I'm used to but seeing since there must be some anti-competitive agreement (no St. Hubert in Ontario, no Swiss Chalet in Quebec) between the companies, it's likely Quebecers are stuck with whatever St. Hubert decides to dish out. Prices are a little on the expensive side but simply put where else are you going to go for chain restaurant roast bird. P.S. From what I've been told, that mysterious one half hamburger bun comes from the fact that it used to be a whole hamburger bun being used as the bread portion of the meal, until the company cut back and started giving one half the amount.

 Was brought here by my friend who lived in Scottsdale for 5 years before leaving for Chicago. Two years later he still craved the Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato pizza. Not sure how I felt about potato on my pizza, I went along for the ride. Holy Holy Holy! I eat plenty of amazing pizza in Chicago, but I am now in love with one more. And in Scottsdale of all places. We went for lunch so we avoided the crowds and were so pleased. The other thin crust pizza we had was equally as delicious and so were the salads. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Its a chain BBQ place but if you're in town visiting you probably haven't heard of it. The wait staff is excellent, helpful and friendly. they even explain the different sauces. They have regular specials and even happy hour specials. The food is good, i haven't really had a bad thing on their menu. Its not your Texas bbq served on butcher paper but its good for AZ standards. I'd recommend the place for family or friends visiting the valley looking for a nice family restaurant, they have salads, wings, fish, chicken, ribs, brisket and a full bar. Im not sure i'd take someone who doesn't eat meat here. Go check it out i doubt you'll be disappointed. They even cater large parties and its ok to bring the kids to this place family friendly!! Also sign up for the email club you get coupons, specials and a free meal on your birthday ",0,0,1,0,0

 You know my dog has it really tough. After 8 hard hours of sleeping on my bed, he has to get up when I do, follow me around the house while I get ready and see me off to work. Then it's outside for his sun bath, followed by 15 minutes of getting into stuff, and then a rigorous stretch. Then a 4 hour nap, some sniffing, and then another nap. No wonder he's so tired when I get home that he collapses on the nearest pile of laundry and proceeds to start snoring. It's a ruff time (haha, I'm so flippin' funny.) So when he's stressed out and needs a break, we head on over to Cosmo Dog Park for Yappy Hour. There is butt sniffing to do, pee mail to check, and all kinds of activities. If the car is dirty and the weather is warm, we go in to the lake area where he can fulfill his dream of being a water dog. After some swimming and splashing, and of course some vigorous shaking (as close to his human as possible, because the only thing hotter than lake water in your mouth is wet dog lake water hurled at the speed of light) it's off to the big dog area, for some running, ball chasing and agility fun. They have well constructed agility equipment - yay for concrete, good watering areas, and TONS of room to run and romp. Plenty of nasty tennis balls to throw, and most people are good about the poop scooping. The fact they have a completely separate area for small dogs is a huge plus too. Overall, while this is more of a drive for us, it makes my dogs day to go out and have fun at the park, and the quality of this park makes the extra miles well worth it. Side note: I'd love to kick the person who voted good for kids, dog parks are NOT FOR CHILDREN of the two legged variety. Just because your kid likes dogs doesn't mean my dog likes kids. He does, but I feel terrible when dogs trample toddlers, the screaming and crying gives me a headache. Let me bring my baby (the furry kind that will never talk back) and leave your ankle biters at home. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I honestly wouldn't give this place any star's if that was possible. It's been awhile since I've had absolutely horrible service and tasteless food all in one visit. But this location seemed to hit both. The service was HORRIBLE. My friend and I decided to sit at the bar, thinking that getting drinks would be easier but the girl was for lack of better words just out of it and not paying attention and we had to wave her down every time we wanted to get something to drink. As for the food. THE WORST sushi I've ever had. The rolls were seriously overpriced, and disgusting.Aside from the fact she just completely forgot two of our rolls. Our meals came with soup that our waitress/bartender forgot about and she but after we reminded her she brought them out and it was basically just broth no tofu. Totally cheap'd out on the Miso Soup. I left that place soo upset and just soo disappointed. I would STRONGLY suggest you not waste your time nor your money on making a visit here. I have plenty of positive sushi reviews and suggestions if you're looking for a great spot. ",1,0,0,0,0

 No more shopping at Best Buy for us! After the first incident a few weeks prior to this incident where Best Buy pulled a bait and switch with a promotion (buy an iPad and get a free iPhone). --They were out of the 16 gb iPhone for the promotion, had no plans to order anymore. They tried to charge us $100 for a 32 gb iPhone but we didn't need a 32 gb iPhone. If you don't have the items for the promotion, then stop advertising that promotion, right? After arguing this one with management, we did not pay $100 for the 32 gb iPhone because we were not told any of this until we were purchasing the iPad. Trust me, they got the $100 because their price on the iPad is $100 higher than other retailers (i.e., Verizon $429). A few weeks later, I had an accident with my iPhone that involved water, that we thought was covered by their Geek Squad protection plan. We took the phone to Best Buy and the Geek Squad rep told me that the Geek Squad protection plan on my iPhone does not cover water damage! The Geek Squad rep pretty much called me a liar by saying that the phone had been submerged in a pool for who knows how long - really? When we purchased the protection plan for $14.99 a month we were told by the salesperson at Best Buy that anything is covered under this plan with two exceptions (lost or stolen) -- as it should be for $14.99 a month! To make a long story short, the only answer that Best Buy had for me was to buy a new iPhone 5 for $700 or 5C for $599. They didn't even try to do anything for us and suggested that we try Verizon, and so we did. Verizon sure did take care of us! The Verizon rep even called Geek Squad customer service because he could not believe that Best Buy would not honor the protection plan on my iphone! He said that the Verizon protection plan covers water damage and therefore I would have gotten a new phone! Verizon protection plans cost quite a bit less and cover more so I would avoid Best Buy Geek Squad protection plans! Interesting enough, I left Verizon with a new iPhone 5C that I purchased for under $100 with my iPhone 5 trade-in. Basically, Best Buy was not willing to honor their more expensive geek squad protection plan so we will go elsewhere now. Best Buy will not get another dime of our money! It looks like Best Buy lied to us when we purchased the protection plan when they said just bring it in and if we can't repair it we will replace it! They just told our son the same sales pitch two weeks ago when he activated a new phone at Best Buy. Shame on you Best Buy! I guess the slogan on the Mobile Phone Protection Plan 'Whenever you need us, we'll be there"" and ""Probably the Best Protection Plan in the Known Universe"" is not so true after all! --One unsatisfied customer!

 Ended up getting the wife's birthday present here. We were actually at the Chanel store in the Encore portion not the Wynn, not sure why there are two stores so close together. Lin helped us who was extremely helpful and friendly. We highly recommend her. We were looking at the wallets and Lin took out two trays full of wallets of every type and color imaginable. Never saw the selection in any other Chanel store like this one. The wife found one which she had a hard time finding at other stores.

 We visited Discovery Place on the Monday after Easter. We were there very close to opening time since we weren't sure if it would get crowded with Spring Breakers. We had the second floor mostly to ourselves for a good 25 minutes or so. We got to see and try a lot of things that probably had waits later on. The museum is really nicely laid out and decorated with kids in mind. Bathrooms seemed plentiful and well placed. Our 6 year old had a good time running around trying the different exhibits. I'm not sure he ""learned"" a lot, but he liked the hand on-ness of it. The 2 year old just wanted to see what her brother was doing. For mom and dad it was a fun morning, but not ecstacy. We considered the IMAX, but with the 2 year old we decided, with the advice of the lady at the admission desk, that it would be a bit much. We did see The Little Prince in the smaller 3D theater and that was quite enough 3D for us. We didn't spend any time in the hands on room for the little kids. By the time we got there it was pretty crowded and a little bonkers. Might have been a better place to start. We had planned on being there long enough to have lunch in the cafe, but we were pretty much done by about 11:30, so we moved on to find lunch elsewhere. We did tour through the gift/souvenir shop. Most of the stuff was pretty overpriced (as expected), but there were a few things to be had for a couple bucks for the kids to take something home. Overall, I'm glad we went, but I doubt we'd go again on a future Charlotte visit. Unless we just did the IMAX when the kids are older. ",0,0,1,0,0

 First time in Vegas and was walking around the strip and ran across this joint. Hot dogs sounded uhmazing at the time so I decided to give it a try (and I had no idea Pink's was around the corner). I had the Fun-Ghi (char grilled Frank, grilled mushrooms, caramelized onion, gruyere cheese and truffle mayo). I had been burned previously with truffled flavored anything (since it is usually never really truffle). It sounded delicious though. The dog itself was good. Juicy and good flavor. Toppings...disappointing. Main reason being that it was all one note, one flavor (they were cooked well for what they were). Every ingredient on top was umami that it all just became overwhelming. I remember even waking up the next morning wishing I had ordered a different hot dog, specifically the Empire State dog. My boyfriend got the Detroit Coney Classic and he was satisfied. I tried it and it was much better. So, if you do go, I'd stick to the classics (classic for a reason, no? The balance of acids and textures always work). Hot dogs are made to be cheap good eats, they don't need fancy toppings. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Let me start by saying everyone I was with loved this place. We had a 4-star experience, but I really didn't like my food so -1 star. I wasn't so wild about it, but they offer a VEGAN burger (the Urth Burger) on their menu so kudos for being vegan inclusive! It's kind of an odd texture, more like felafel than a veg burger. Unique is a good word. It was okay. I'm pretty sure its made of mostly chickpeas and corn. The shoestring fries were pretty amazing though. Also, the alcoholic shakes are pretty excellent. Unfortunately only one works for the dairy free crowd. The smoking passion (or something like that) is Hangar One Mandarin Vodka (see my review on St. George Spirits in Alameda, CA... Hangar One is prob the best vodka I've ever had) and lemon sorbet. Very tasty. Definitely a decent choice for a vegan dining out with meat eaters. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I'd seen this place frequently driving through Tempe, and finally got a chance to try it with my boyfriend this weekend when my vegetarian friend and her vegan boyfriend came to town. Overall I'd give it 4 stars, but I'm rounding up. I'm weighing pretty heavily (at least a full star) for the organic, local menu. Atmosphere was pleasant, bright and open. Service was friendly, with a polite waitress and reasonable serving times. Appetizers: We got classic hummus with pita bread, and vegan spinach and artichoke dip. The former was very plain, even a sprinkle of paprika on top would have helped a lot. Possibly our own fault for ordering classic, rather than an interesting flavor. The latter was actually very good, and I'm hard to please when it comes to fake dairy. I would have been happy with two of those. Entrees: Each couple got a wrap to share. My friend and her boyfriend ordered a veggie wrap, and confirmed that it would come cut in half. They both enjoyed it, commented on the flavors, and identified a plethora of veggies in the wrap. Each half was also huge, so they were glad to have split it. My boyfriend and I got the chicken shawarma wrap and failed to confirm if it would be served cut in half (though we did make it clear we'd be sharing). It came in a sort of overflowing taco situation, wrapped in foil. The waitress wished us luck in splitting it, as she dropped it off. Oh thanks. We passed it back and forth taking bites. It was pretty tasty though. Beverages: I got a strawberry lemonade, my friend got a pomegranate iced tea, and the guys had water. The lemonade was good, but it had a sort of ""artificial sweetener"" after-taste that was disappointing. My friend said her tea tasted more like a good green-tea than anything fruity. She wasn't complaining, but it wasn't what she expected. The bill: Prices are going to be higher when the food is organic and locally grown. I'm willing to pay more for that if that's what I'm after, but considering we weren't entirely impressed by our half of the meal, it felt like a lot. Our friends were a lot more satisfied since they thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of their meal, and are more willing to pay for organic food. $20 for lunch for two people isn't bad, but considering we shared everything and didn't feel like it was spectacular, this won't likely be a regular spot for us. If I do return, I'll make different choices when I'm ordering. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Not impressed! Went here for happy hour and it was empty (usually a bad sign)! Our waitress/bartender was snooty and not very helpful. I hate that because for us part of the experience of sitting at the bar is chatting with the bartender, but unfortunately that didn't happen here. The happy hour appetizers were tiny and we calculated that each small bite we took cost about $3 which is probably normal for Vegas, but we had found other wonderful happy hours that were a much better deal and a lot more fun. I really wanted to like this place because the menu looked interesting and it had great reviews, but will not be returning. ",0,1,0,0,0

 As a mom, I have a genuine appreciation for this place. We enjoyed the free, self-assisted tour of the chocolate factory, and the gardens are so pretty! I wish the tour was longer, as it's really more of a window into the factory for the length of a hallway. But, who can complain about free?! And I love that the garden has all the plants labeled, with both their latin and common names, so you can educate yourself as you stroll around. Of course, the chocolate is excellent. And my daughter was very appreciative of the M&M selection. As far as price, the cost is fair. Seems to cater a bit to the touristy element in terms of price and selection, so I would rather buy bulk candy elsewhere. But I'd get the fresh ice cream anytime! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Wow... You guys have OFFICIALLY hit a new low! First, you pulled a massively sneaky pete by tricking my fiance into a 2 year contract by offering a $100 promotion (and of course, forgetting to mention that accepting the promotion would mean a contract), then, after visiting the store, and calling several times to speak with your utterly incompetent reps, he finally managed to get the account canceled - double and triple checking that everything was completely paid. Now, mysteriously, several months later, we get a call from a COLLECTIONS agency stating that we owe AT&T money. When we called you guys to find out what the hell was going on - your unfortunate excuses for reps A. Couldn't find the account, and B. Upon finding the account didn't have any good excuses or reasons for not notifying us of an outstanding balance (especially since we made more than enough efforts to make sure that everything was 100% taken care of).

 I like to take ownership of the bar I go to. I like to feel as though when I walk in, I am at home with a bunch of friends. Rarely do I feel out of place after a couple visits somewhere.........I unfortunately feel that way at Zipps from time to time. I will cover that in a bit.. ~Fud/Drink~ The food is OK. I expect a bar these days to have better food if you are paying the prices they put on the menu. As much as people knocked my old bar that closed, Antars, the food there was amazing, and there are many other spots with better food options than just burgers. Here, its generic bar food. The salads are all iceberg lettuce with some generic romaine thrown in. I can go to a bowling alley and eat the same quality of food. The sandwiches taste good but aren't made with quality add-ins. Prices are still high, and I have to be careful or I'll be spending too much. There aren't many high incentive deals for me on Sundays for specials, most of them are during the week. Oh well. ~Atmosphere/Service~ Jumping to the level of service, let me give you an example of what I recently ran into: I had to go outside during that recent cold spell we had in early January 2013. It was close to 25 out, I had my Jersey on expecting to sit somewhere inside but, due to their expected large rush of customers and the bar being filled, they awkwardly advised me they couldn't let me sit at a table normally for two...Even after I insisted I could wait until a seat opens up at the bar. Instead they had to have me go outside. I didn't bring my coat in, because I was expecting to show off the jersey...that's why you bought it in the first place, lol... Now, given this scenario, I will point out the heaters were on, but its just too damn cold. Personally I think that's just poor service. I was still pretty cold, and the chairs outside are not as comfortable when its 25 out once again. ~Extras/Rating~ Everything said, this place is a popular spot and I had to see it for myself. It may be a good spot to hang out with the guys, given some beer specials for parties of two or more. I usually fly solo on football Sundays. Not many Ravens fans out in the valley ... that'll do it too. I do not knock this place, 3 stars for being a round-about average bar with average food and service. Its a bit generic, but will fill the need for a sports bar if you are in the general area. I would recommend it to others looking to go out for a generic bar atmosphere in the area. I have to mention that Arcadia Tavern, which is right down the street, is in my eyes a much bigger improvement over this Zipps. ",0,0,1,0,0

 February 22nd 2014 Is there a button for zero stars? To keep it short and simple I have been on the phone three different occasions for 3 hour periods. My 2 friends and I are going on a trip to Las Vegas for three nights. Every time I believe my issue is resolved, they pull a fast one to screw over the customer. I was pitched a package that was $200 dollars for 3 nights stay, 100 dollar hilton certificate, free dinner for 2, free VIP show passes. I AM A FULL TIME COLLEGE STUDENT AND 22 YEARS OLD. I repeated this to the salesman at least 5 times making sure I qualified. He guaranteed me that I qualified due to my cell phones area code. (sleazy pitchman move to get his commission and blatantly lie to me ) I also was promised I would stay at the Elara, Hiltons more central location to the strip. April 7th 2014 Well when I call to confirm everything is status quo, the manager told me that I did not meet the requirements and could have a refund. I never received a call that I did not meet the requirements. What if I did not check up and was stranded in Vegas with know place to stay? I talked to the manager who was extremely rude, Brian Gonzalez to look back at the recorded conversation. He negligently obliged and said he would give me a call back. After he realized the sales man LIED to me several times and it was not my fault, he called back with a different attitude allowing me to stay at the Elara for the discounted rate but would not be receiving any of the perks promised. That was fine with me I did not need all of that stuff I just wanted a cheep place to stay for my birthday weekend. May 17th 2014. I wanted to triple check that I would be able to stay at the Elara Hotel in the South Las Vegas Strip vicinity. I call the Elara hotel and am told that I do not have an existing reservation... WHAT!!! I call back Brian Gonzalez to see what had happened over the past month. He told me that I had always been booked at the Hilton Grand Vacation Suites. He was extremely rude and short with me when I asked him to review our conversation on April 7th 2014. He personally called me and booked me at the Elara. Knowing he was lying, he refused to look back at the call! He kept repeating that I was always booked at the Hilton Grand Vacation Suites. THIS WAS NOT WHAT I PAID FOR. Instead of making it right I asked for someone higher up than him. He said to call customer service based in Orlando. I called Hilton Grand Vacations headquarters in Orlando and talked to a supervisor there. They gave me the same run around about the Elara being full and I should have booked earlier. The supervisor in Orlando told me we had two options, either pay for an upgraded room ($56) a night, (The first recruiter told me we could fit 4 people but now I guess the maximum capacity is 2) or receive my money back. At this point I had already bought show tickets, concert tickets, and airfare. I needed somewhere to stay and last minute it was very expensive. I paid to upgrade to the two bedroom suite, they could not even comp me that. CHECKLIST: Promised Elara Hotel and all of the perks and did not receive any of them. Had to PAY $168 to get the suite. (The first marketing guy who sold us this package said the standard room could fit 4) Elevated heart pressure and increased dismay towards Hilton (not really the heart pressure but still) 9 hours of phone calls defending myself for me to be disrespected, lied to, and over charged. After all the confusion and hassle they did not even offer an upgrade or a comped room PLEASE NOBODY GET SCAMMED ON THIS RIDICULOUS ""DEAL"" I hold Hilton to a higher standard than this. I have never felt so disrespected in my life and will NEVER stay at a Hilton again. NEVER will I stay at this hotel that is for sure. I hope someone from the Hilton sees this and makes things right. PS: Sorry that was not to short or simple at all ",1,0,0,0,0

 Feeling hungry, but wanting to save my appetite for a large dinner gathering, I stopped by this shop after work. $3.95 is what you will pay for two slices of cheese pizza with a drink. The employees, were quick to acknowledge my presents and even quicker to heat up my slices. Although the pizza was already made, the few minutes to reheat them in the over brought the slices back to life. The crust was crunchy and had a good chewiness to it. The pizza was greasy, but nowhere near as bad as other places I have been to. The sauce had little flavor and that is where I found fault. Overall, not a bad pizza, but does not stand out. For a quick lunch, it is not bad, but is overshadowed by its surrounding businesses. ",0,0,1,0,0

 It's a UPS Store. I needed some papers faxed and they do faxing. Cost me 2.50 each page but the process was painless and they gave me a free cover sheet as well as printed the confirmation on the back of the cover sheet to save paper. If anyone has a USAA account, UPS stores now offer a method of cash deposits. Basically 2 dollars of what ever you're depositing goes toward a money order for the amount you're depositing (up to a thousand i think) and they deposit the rest via your atm/debit card. No more depositing into another bank then filling out a check from one account to deposit@home to the USAA account which is how i've been doing it. Fast, friendly and knowledgeable service.

 I had high hopes for this burger joint but the food was just meh. We ordered the honey-pig bao buns and it seemed like we were just eating the bun! An order comes with two buns and the meat to bun ration was like 1:5 ! The smallest piece of meat ever with cucumber, radish, and cilantro that did not go well together at all. Yuck. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger that came with roasted jalepeno peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomatoes which all sound like it would be a heavenly burger, right? Wrong! It didn't taste like 1 whole burger, but rather just eating parts of it together. The boyfriend got the chili dog which had roasted fresno peppers, jalapeno, cheese, avocado, onion, and chipotle ketchup. All sounds like amazing ingredients!! But the taste.. it did not marry well together at all. So disappointing. The truffle parmesan fries were the only thing that saved this meal. ",0,1,0,0,0

 So, I had The Vig bookmarked for almost 2 years and I was very upset with myself after my 1st time here that it took me so long to get my booty in this establishment!! I loved it. I went total gluttony overboard and I have ZERO regrets. Edamame was fantastic. Their cheesy tator tots that tasted like God hand rolled them himself were a flavor party in my mouth with every delicious savory both (slight drooling happening), we had the whitefish special and killed that in about 3.5 minutes. My boo had the short rib tacos as well...he murdered those as well...no remaining meat was found anywhere. We also had shrimp pad Thai and the mac& cheese. Yes , this was ALL consumed among two ppl. We finished everything besides the two pastas which we took home and thoroughly enjoyed the next day. Craft beers, and cocktail drinks were happily consumed as well. The food is of really good quality here. I left feeling full but not the run down I need a nap bcus I cant move full.

 ** if you're going for the doggie side of the building then I suggest you take your beloved family member and money some place else. These people never smile and always seem cold. On the cat side they're always cheerful and willing to assist you with whatever. My first visit with my new chi puppy was a good experience. Paper work and the waiting was quick and we were taken care of as soon as possible. ** Our first doctor, Dr. Renee Lewis, was very thorough and gave Eva her first shots INFRONT of us. She even explained that Eva would have to come in SEVERAL times for her other shots due to her small size, that she wouldn't get them all together. I kept that in mind and was also sent a reminder of the next vaccines for our next visit. Now our second visit was TERRIBLE. I brought my boyfriends 2 year old male Bichon specifically asking for just his rabies shot. The lady in the front added more vaccines that weren't needed along with giving my chi pup to get the same shots with several others. The lady nor did our new doctor, Dr. Sharon Lewis, explain what the dogs would be getting before they took our dogs behind closed doors for their vaccines. I didn't know until I saw it all on the receipt because the price was a bit higher than what I expected. When I went back in to explain that I never asked for these shots another lady had to take care of my complaint. The original was unprofessional and told the lady to pass along that she explained what my dogs were getting. It is very cowardly that she didn't speak to me directly since I was her customer. I will not be returning due to the fact they said a manager would call me the day after to talk to me about the situation and their employee, who is the first person everyone sees when they walk in, was horrible with customer service.

 The construction noise near the hotel was unbearable. Jackhammers everywhere building the City Center complex. Very loud at the pool.

 I was reading the recommendations here and choose the NUDO for my todays dinner. It's central in chinatown and close to the Montreal Traveller Lodge. The ambient looks typical chinese, big room and just put some chairs and tables in. The TVs showing Karaoke. I ordered S-03 it's the chicken soup. After a short time of waiting, I got the soup and was surprised about the smell and the look. First I tried the soup and felt like in heaven, super delicious, not salty and a rich taste .. like a soup should be. The 2nd try where the noodle. the noddles where ""al dente"" and smooth together. A dream to hv to noodles and the soup together in the bowl. As starter I ordered the spring rolls, but finally I was too full to finish them. So guys if you come here even you re really hungry, just order the ramen first and maybe later the starter. Really a place to come back and enjoy again ",0,0,0,1,0

 Two words: MAN SPA! At least for me, anyway! I stopped in at the last minute before a trip to see mom (and you know how they can get with wrinkled cloths and haircuts!), and was delighted to find no line. The stylist on duty took me back to her chair, and let me know what my menu options were. I was surprised to see that there were more than just one option for services! And all this time, I thought a haircut was a haircut! Since it was my ""first time"", I got the MVP package upgrade on the house. This included a cut, shampoo, style, and shoulder rub. The stylist was quite pleasant, and we had a great conversation over the course of the cut. And, the cut was awesome. Probably one of the top 5 haircuts of my life! Each stylist's chair has its own TV tuned to sports, and the decor is locker room-meets-barbershop! Overall, it's a great 20 minute getaway from the regular work/school/life grind. And, your mom won't nag at you to get a haircut! ",0,0,0,1,0

 We met Brian (salesman, not owner) at a home show in Las Vegas. He was the first vendor we talked to that actually knew what he was talking about. We had previous experience with solar. We compared their product, service, rate, etc. to 2 other companies and by far they were the best. They delivered exactly what was promised and actually underestimated our production. They took care of all the paperwork, permits, and helped us get set up with the PUC for credits. We had a small problem getting set up with NV Energy and the meter which cost us a weeks worth of production, but Gregg made it right with a fair dollar amount we would have saved. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Overrated. I'm not saying that as a bitter partier who had to wait hours in line while the asshole security guards went on their power-trips. (Seriously though...the line outside went on for miles!) We got hooked up and actually got in within a few minutes, but I soon came to the conclusion that I would've rather stayed outside in line...at least I could breathe out there. 1. The narrow stairways leading to the second story dance floor and the rooftop lounge were always packed! We started out at the bottom, excited to see what awaits us atop this famous club...Within a minute of reaching the top, we turned around and pushed our way back down the stairs, eager to escape the extreme cold of the rooftop and the disgusting humidity of the dance floor. What a waste. 2. I'm giving it 2 stars because the lounge downstairs was actually pretty nice...and their drinks were strong, so that's always a plus. Comments my friends made throughout the night: ""Hey...if there was a fire right now, we'd all die."" - Friend #1 (while we were on the main dance floor) ""I know the decor is supposed to be Asian, but it's really really awkward drinking and clubbing with a million Buddhas watching you..."" - Friend #2 ",0,1,0,0,0

 The only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1 is bc my extremely mediocre and overpriced black bean chicken temporarily ruined my appetite & left me more room for the Rio seafood buffet the next day. Then again, maybe I subconsciously wanted to pay a lot to eat blah food - being from LA, how did I expect this place, catering mainly to drunken tourists that have never had authentic bb chicken, to compare with the real stuff in LA? Also, I was particularly upset that I discovered the Burger Bar was also at Mandalay Bay right after eating here. I had been jonesing for a burger alllll night and specifically had my mind set on burger bar, but forgot which hotel it was in. On the bright side, my skimpy little shreds of chicken accompanied by a few bell peppers was probably a lot less caloric. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I find this place absolutely delicious, but rarely end up going there when the inevitable conversation arises: ""Where do you want to go? I dunno. Where do you want to go?"" It is a bit tucked away in a little strip mall, so I'm going to chalk it up to location and not the fact that I typically have the memory of a gnat. If you've never had a pasty (pronounced pah-stee, unlike the pay-stee nipple adhesives strippers wear), you're missing out on a hearty English Hot Pocket. However, likening it to a Hot Pocket does it a disservice. Hot Pockets consist of cardboard crust filled with nuclear hot goo that causes blisters and cursing, rather than sighs of content and delight. While both are great drunk/hangover food, the Cornish Pasty Co. far surpasses the measly freezer dried Hot Pocket. While they have flavors that are also available as Hot Pocket varieties (taste test!), my dining partner routinely reminds me that he will shun me for indulge in one of those. Not that it's hard to find at least five different flavors that you could imagine chowing down. I always end up just blurting out my decision at the last minute to end my indecisiveness. They updated the menu recently and it now includes a bunch of flavors that weren't previously available, like carne adovada. Mmm. So if you haven't been here in a while, give it another go and try something new. For about seven bucks you get a huge, stick-to-your-ribs pastry filled with a wide variety of meats and vegetables. I've never tried the vegetarian choices, but there are quite a few on the menu (about half as many as the non-vegetarian options). Among the traditional pasties, you can't go wrong with the oggie, shepards pie or lamb and mint. I've tried the chicken tikka masala, greek chicken, and lamb vindaloo from the fancy schmancy options and they were just as stellar. The greek salad is also pretty respectable, with a hefty amount of kalamata olives and feta cheese. Watching the cooks at work is part of the fun at this place, so have a seat at the bar. Just make sure to do so far enough away from the oven that you won't end up dried out like beef jerky at the end of your meal. When you get the bill, there's a cashier near the door that you can cash out at if you're in a hurry, since the servers are a little bit on the slow side. Slow, laid back, whatever. Their happy hour is also an awesome option to opt for, and is offered every day from 3 to 5 pm. There's a dollar off beers, three dollar Irish car bombs and two dollar top shelf shots (Ketel One vodka, Jameson whiskey, etc.), so if you're looking to spend an afternoon getting stinko and munching on some awesome food, this is the place to be.

 My wife and I found Angel's Blessing Spa online. We were visiting from out of town and hate to pay the strip prices for massage. Even with the cost of taxi to and from the day spa, it was less than it would've been to pay the outrageous prices on the strip. I had Aya and my wife had Armando. As soon as we saw each other at the end of our massages we gave each other the thumbs up. We both loved the massages. They paid attention to what we liked and changed the pressure accordingly. Aya used several different techniques during my massage including pressure points, deep tissue and stretches. We each got an hour and a half massage and came out feeling relaxed and ready for the rest of our vacation on the Las Vegas strip! Angel's Blessing's Spa is amazing! I strongly recommend it. I can't wait to get back to Vegas so I can get another massage from Aya! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've been to Se \ u00f1or Taco twice: drive through once and came into the restaurant once. When I used the drive through I waited about 20 minutes in the car and got home to find someone else's order. I called the restaurant to resolve the confusion to no avail. My visit to the restaurant settled any ideas I had about this place, I walked into a dirty dining room which had most tables empty but dirty and a mop and mop bucket sitting by the door. The restaurant had a strong sewage odor and for some reason the bathroom door was propped open. I didn't order food. ",1,0,0,0,0

 We had a large party on Saturday night and were promptly seated when at least ten guests arrived. I ordered the Firebird Rotisserie Chicken with potato salad and grilled vegetables on the side. The chicken was perfectly cooked with moist breast and dark meat. We also enjoyed their famous homemade cornbread. My buddies went straight to the red meat, which I looked at with envy.

 My GF had a business conference in Vegas at The Wynn. She got a wicked rate for airfare and 6 nights here through Allegiant Air. The hotel is a luxury 5 star indeed. Staff was all super friendly and not pretentious. Filled with high end boutiques like Dior, Chanel, Alexander McQueen, Rolex, Louis Vuitton, Even a Ferrari dealership! Everything is bright and cheery, the attention to detail amazing, all the way to the stained glass butterfly mosaic tiles on the floor. The girl who checked us in was nice & friendly. She gave us a room on the 39th floor since we were staying a week. We had to give a 200$ deposit on the credit card. This later was a 900$ deposit - we never quite understood why. Something to do with the Internet which made no sense. Our room was a deluxe resort double. Floor to ceiling windows overlooked the spectacular golf course and pools. The bathroom was huge ! 2 sinks 2 mirrors, a large vanity and shelves under each sink left lots of room for our toiletries & products. Huge soaker tub and separate shower with room to sit down in it. The room itself was bigger then my entire apartment ! 2 super comfy beds with lots of pillows and sheets with a very large thread count. Everything is on a control that sits on the bedside table. Buttons to open and close the heavy curtains that blocks out all light, as well as the shears. It also controls the lighting, which has buttons for all off, all on, night lights, etc. The air conditioning was also nice in that you could set it to the exact temperature you desired. There was a large desk, with fax machine, and a few chairs. The mini bar and snack bar was fully stocked, but came with a warning that 60 seconds of anything being removed would be charged to the room. There was no coffee maker or fridge, but you can get one @25$ a day. A resort fee of 25$ a day was also in effect. This coverage WiFi for all devices, local and toll free calls. The bellman delivered our bags very quickly and even got us ice, Housekeeping was immaculate, and would service the room whenever they were called. Lots of towels, nice robes, and the toiletries provided were generous, however I didn't like the lemon grass scent. We never ordered room service. The menu was vast, and looked really good, with lots of variety and options, but the prices were so high, unless you had an expense account be prepared to pay through the nose. The rack rate listed for our room was $1500 a night. That's pretty crazy, The casino was OK, played a bit of slots, won a few bucks. Was never offered a drink. The Encore casino was better by far. They have a 24 hour cafe and drugstore. Both were pricey. The pool was huge, and had lots of chairs, downside was it was only open until 6 week nights. Open until 7 on weekends. I was really hoping it would of been open until 11pm, but no such luck. The surrounding cabanas looked nice but pricey. Be prepared to show your room key in order to get access to the elevator or the pool area. They are quite strict about this. We slept so good, between the comfy beds, and the blackout drapes, we never woke up until 7 pm the day after we arrived! The lock on the door however was defective, we were locked once when we tried to leave. They had to send up security to let us out. Thankfully, they were prompt. We were told that they had called a locksmith, and that the security guard would stand by until they arrived. We left, but the lock was still glitchy. We had to slam it more then once in order for it to lock. I had a small package sent to the hotel. It went to the business center. It was a $8 handling charge. While I waited, they let me use the Internet on a private computer, and gave me a bottle of water. They were super nice. Another complaint was on our last night there, at 5am we were unable to sleep due to the people next door. They were super loud. We waited Until 530 am. Between the music and the loud voices, we had no choice other then to call the front desk. We were told they would send up security. Over 20 Min's past, I called again, they said security was en route. The noise level subsided a bit for maybe 5 Min's, then it was right back. We were getting pissed at this point. It was after 6am! We had to get up at 10am to pack, check out, and fly home. I called ( this now was the third time! ) They asked if we wanted to change rooms! As if we would pack and change rooms at this hour, only to check out? If anything, the other people should be made to change rooms - or check out. They asked if we wanted security back up? Duh! Yes of course. At this point I was exhausted. I finally fell asleep. Lucky we got a late check out. we asked for a bellman to assist with our bags. 20 Min's later, he still had not arrived. We had a shuttle booked for 1-115pm so we called to cancel the bellman as at this point, it was almost 1 pm. We were able to check out via the phone with a receipt emailed to my GF. ",0,0,0,1,0

 First time trying this place out, and it was actually okay. I got the Belgian waffle and sweet potato fries. The waffle was good, and crisp. I really came here for a waffle but would go back for the sweet potato fries. My grandma can't taste, and goes by texture so she asked for her hash brown extra crispy and our server offered to deep fry them. Although probably not so healthy it was really good! And my grandma loved them, and loved that our server catered to what we like! She was very friendly and helpful, I though the food could have come out a little faster, but then again maybe I was just hungry. And im sure what we ordered takes some time to cook more. All in all, I like the place and will be back for more sweet potato fries;) ",0,0,0,1,0

 Tired of the casino scene I wanted to take my girlfriend to a classy hotel and spa in Vegas. I couldn't find any package deals online so I decided to write the manager of booking directly. I saw that he was very active in responding to good and or bad reviews online. He wrote back within the day and had made special accommodations for us to stay in a very nice clean room and have a couples massage. The staff was amazing and we were treated great by all aspects of the business. I recommend contacting Derek at DerekMorrison@lvplatinum.com and seeing what can be done for you. Also, the ""Platinum paint party"" is an awesome and fun thing to do with your significant other. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've always found Oregano's pizza decent. Between Tombstone and their thin crust, it would be a toss up that usually ended up with me preheating the oven. A friend convinced me to try it again saying that their pasta is much better than their pizza. I got Mama's Sausage and Peppers. It was actually pretty good. How do you mess that up, right? It was a little confusing when two different people came by to ask if I wanted parmesan cheese on top, the top was already covered with parmesan cheese.... The notorious star of the meal however was the lasagna. It was hands down the worst lasagna I've ever had. There was maybe one layer of pasta, a layer of mozzarella on top and a little cheese in the middle, but the bulk of it was several layers of overworked ground meat(?). It's almost like a huge nasty meatball with some sauce and cheese in different spots that you found in the back of the fridge. I was going to give 3 stars until later on in the meal I tried a piece of meat that was hanging out in the middle of the plate that didn't have any cheese or sauce to hide behind. That little morsel of meat lost this place another star. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Went at 6:30pm, on a Thursday night (tonight), food was cold and old looking. I special ordered a pound of crab legs, they were ice cold inside in parts. The only thing I ate that was hot was what I had the lady cook for me on the grill. If you other folks think this is a 4 and 5 star place, either you do not get out much or your other local choices suck worse than this place. Maybe this place is better on the weekend when they actually have customers and the food turns over more frequently and is fresher. But I will never be back to find out. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I am not a fan of circus acts. I've seen enough tumblers, tight rope walkers, and contortionists to last a lifetime. However, while this show does indeed center around circus acts, it incorporates a host and hostess so funny and engaging I would watch a show featuring just them. The Gazillionaire and Penny are funny as hell, engaging, and just plain awesome to watch. The intimacy of the tent also made the circus acts fun to watch, even for me.

 This airport has quite a few things going for it. First it's in Vegas so most people are in a great mood when they land, then maybe they're broke and bitter when they leave but maybe not. They do have slot machines in the airport so if you have a few dollars left you can play them to pass the time while you wait for your flight. They also have cigar and liquor stores in the airport so you can get some items to enjoy on your way to your hotel and thorough the visit. They also have working wifi and zones where you can recharge your phone, laptop, etc. The airport is also close to the strip which is convenient, though all car rentals are offsite so you have to take a shuttle bus which is a little annoying but no big deal. The bad things are subpar food options depending where you are in the terminal and more importantly the terminal can be CROWDED sometimes with people standing in the aisle and circling the seating area like a shopper in a Christmas mall parking lot trying to scoop up the last seat. Overall it's not a bad airport, so long as you get a seat! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Sushi is the type of food I can most comfortably say I frequent the most. It almost seems like I am always trying to find the best sushi spots in Vegas and find out what they're all about. Plus, I usually always target AYCE sushi joints because I am a big guy with a big appetite. With that being said, whenever I prod anyone to come out and eat sushi with me I always hear the name ""Sushi Twister"" mentioned. While there are a lot of people that rave about this place, I'm never quite in the same boat as they are. Don't get me wrong.. the ambiance is great, the staff is friendly, and the location is awesome (about 15 minutes from my house and about 2 minutes away from my job) but the sushi doesn't cut it for me. There are a few good rolls like the Freddy vs. Jason, Boulder Crunchy, and the Ecstasy roll but the majority of the rolls I didn't really find appealing. I like the fact that they had low sodium soy sauce, good prices on Sake, and a giant screen projection for a movie or sporting event, but after going there a few times I'd rather stick to my usual hangouts. On a side note, the chefs were pretty funny and just a tad bit obnoxious at times but that only added to the appeal of the Sushi Twister environment. Not bad IMO but not enough to coax me back for another AYCE encounter with the ""Twister"". ",0,0,0,1,0

 STILL the best club in Vegas and maybe even the entire universe. I come here every single time I come to Vegas and keep waiting to get sick of it but I never do. Beautiful people, great music, lovely outside garden area, about 154 bars so you always have easy access to alcohol. The line's not so bad anymore either now that they have some ""competition"" with Hakasan down the Strip, although I still think XS is about 1,000 times better than Hakasan any day of the week. I was thinking about what makes XS so damn amazing and it has to be the fact that half of it is outside in a pool and garden setting. That and the crowd is very sexy and a good age range (think late 20s to early 40s) and in general is about as classy as you can get in a nightclub setting. ",0,0,0,0,1

 As a 6' tall woman, you may understand my need for a go-to tailor. I currently live in Laveen and this has been my go to shop for 8 years.

 Casual sports bar with large connected patio. It's a nice place to get away from the fancier Scottsdale bars. Lots of places to sit or stand, both inside and out. It's easy to see the remnant layout from Spanish Fly, the previous bar that featured a large pool in the middle. I like what they did with the space - added more tables, an area for cornhole bean bag toss, and ping pong. The bar is large and wraps around with plenty of TV's. I've been here a couple times. The first was to watch a boxing match. It doesn't take long to have a drink in your hand and the standing room comfortably affords crowds. The second time was on a Saturday morning. A couple guys wanted to have a few rounds of beers and play bags. It was warm out, so despite the outdoor fans and portable AC units, we built up a sweat. We ordered a bucket of Coors light. You get 5 cans for $16. Later we ordered some Corona's. Again, we got cans. I'm not complaining, but glass bottles would have been a nicer touch. Sometime, I will try the food. My friends' tacos looked pretty good, and they've got a nice selection, though you can't mix and match. Overall, Boondocks is an average watering hole, with nothing particularly memorable about it. But that's not a bad thing! What it offers is a relaxed patio to grab a beer and watch some sports, preferably on a nice day. And sometimes, that's exactly what you're looking for. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Everything about Nora's was an amazing experience! We walked in, were seated right away, and the staff was very attentive to our needs. Checked in on the Yelp app and received a glass of wine! Free wine = AMAZEBALLS! Started off with the house garlic bread. It was very good. You could tell this was homemade, not some frozen loaf coming from a distributor. Just that principle of not having frozen cheap appetizer had me already falling in love. Then we moved to the bruschetta. It came served on a large slide of soft bread. This was some of the best bruschetta I've ever had. It was not your average sampling, this is what I've been missing my entire life. My entree was the rigatoni gorgonzola with chicken. Similar to the bruschetta, this was done right! The pasta was perfectly textured and consistent throughout. The sauce on this was heavier than my liking, but it fit very well with the dish. The biggest surprise here was the blue cheese on top. I've never heard of pasta being topped with blue cheese, but I fell in love with it! By this point we were stuffed and ready to fall asleep in our carb coma. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I recently visited tanzy before viewing at Ipic. The food and service was outstanding. The bartenders have a great array of drinks and recommendations. The service was great and very attentive. The food is by far the best thing there. The brussel sprouts and calamari appetizers were out of this world. The calamari is not bar food calamari that has been fried, instead its sauteed and is very fresh. For my main dish I had the seafood ciopinno. It was a wide variety of fresh seafood over pasta and the spices used were to perfection. I will continue to eat here before going to the movies and I recommend you do that same! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Black Chile was the name of the previous restaurant that occupied the space. Just a tidbit. Now to the review: The hostess was very nice and polite to us and we were greeted quickly. A major plus in my book. We really didn't have to wait on a Friday because a sit at the bar opened up...I am walking to the bar with my wife. My nose is assaulted with the worst smell, the smell that only comes from bars that make fruity drinks and use fresh ingredients. I can't knock 'em but they need candles or something. Too the food we go: Salsa and chips. Check. The salsa is legit. I could order that all day. Fajita's. Meh...salty, salty, salty. Good portion but you will need water.

 I'd rather have EBOLA. The truth is, this place has gone downhill quickly. Nothing is EVER labeled right. The dishes are either cold, or over cooked. The prices seem to change slightly depending on who the server is at the time, and the iced tea tastes like it's made with recycled teabags. One time we saw a roach, it almost took my wallet. To say it's dirty would be giving dirty places a bad name. I'm a fat guy who likes buffets, but this place had me packing it up before I even finished the first plate. Don't be fooled into thinking that this is like Pacific Seafood & Buffet in Tempe or on Bell Road... it's kind of got the same name, but lots of shame in its game. Seafood here means overcooked fish and stale sushi. If you want crab legs, go at night, and pay a lot more for dried out crab legs. I guess if you are looking for a selection of 6 different shrimp dishes that all taste exactly the same, it's awesome. If anything here was ""cooked fresh"" that clearly means BEFORE it was shipped from overseas... AVOID, unless you like vomiting. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I already did not like this walmart due to all the rude emplyoees that are always working, but yetserday they crossed the like.

 I don't understand all the negative reviews. I was just here for 3 nights and we had a wonderful time! We stayed in Tower 1, which didn't have any special views of the strip but we didn't care about that. We were in Vegas for Vegas..not to be in the room the entire time. We were only in the room to sleep and needed a place to crash at the end of our long Vegas days of walking the strip. If you have the same needs, Excalibur is the place for you. The rates are cheaper and the rooms are comfortable...the beds were very nice after a long day of walking around the strip. Housekeeping was also very helpful in our trip as we needed them a few times to get items for us that we forgot and they had them at our room within minutes! The only downside is the location on the strip as it is on the South end...so if you want to go anywhere, it is a pretty good walk...but I actually appreciated that bc it forced me to get some much needed exercise after all the eating I did. They also have an $18 resort fee which includes internet and use of their fitness center if you need more exercise. I'll definitely be back as this was a great hotel for the price. It was much nicer than the Quad down the way, which is currently offering rates double what Excalibur is offering. ",0,0,0,1,0

 At TI and wanted to eat at a restaurant that was closed so we came here. We were sat by the door of their show so we could barely hear each other. Boyfriend ordered a steak for $35 that had a lot of fat and no flavor. French fries cold, nachos blah with no real cheese or full coverage but the crab cakes and other side items were good. They offered us coupons for 2 for 1 entrees but the fine print only allowed up to $20 off and most entrees costed more. They also offered a 2 for 1 yard drink but it couldn't be combined with the other coupon. Our server was great though, he was friendly and brought us a new set of warm fries and a complimentary alcoholic beverage for the inconvenience we were experiencing. So although the food wasn't great and we wouldn't come back or recommend this establishment - I gave two stars for the service and crab cakes. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Best toasted subs in Chandler! Try the Torpedo or the Planet Sub. It all started one spring day in Arizona... Laying on the table in front of me, someone had bought me a six inch roll of aluminum foil that looked strikingly like a Chipotle burrito. It wasn't. You could tell it was a sub based on shape and smell. I was informed that it came from Subway, but after one bite, I knew that it couldn't be Subway. The foil should have given that away. And, boy, the sub was tasty. Freshly toasted, spongy bread, Salami, Pepperoni, Pastrami, Swiss, Black Olives, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Dijon. The best Italian sandwich I'd tasted in a while - and I'm not an olive guy. I HAD to know where it was from, but the mystery lunch provider was gone. Weeks later, I stumbled upon Planet Subs on Yelp and recognized its proximity to my house. Doing some detective work, I noticed the all-too-familiar aluminum wrap. The ingredients checked out too. I was reunited with the Torpedo, one of the best items on Planet Sub's menu! Quick Note: The location on Arizona Ave has really funky hours (I think it caters to a lunch crowd). I've gone several times, only to be disappointed by dark lights and a sign redirecting me to this location on Germann. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've always said I avoid ""fusion"" restaurants. I am a vegetarian and it should be easy to find something anywhere... but with fusion dishes it's nearly impossible to customize or substitute entrees and that creates problems for my diet and (mushroom) allergy. Last night while arriving 45 min. prior to watching ""perks of being a wallflower"" (watch it!) I noticed this place next door. I have been wanting to try ""tapas"" (this was not that style of small plates)... My friend and I stopped in and ordered two individual glasses of sake wine (try the top red option if you dine here! I had the white peach- meh.) I simply ordered dessert which was the banana fritter + ice cream. It was good but nothing spectacular. Ordinary deep fried 'nana, fruit as a garnish, and a scoop of ice cream. Not even really worth the $6. Why didn't I eat any 'real food'? I only noticed one tofu dish listed throughout the whole menu. Not very impressed. And NOT veggie friendly. I've been to other sushi places and usually I can at best find a ramen noodle option. Not the case here. Also, the female server was nice 'n all, she mentioned. . .""Oh if you ever stop here AFTER your movie you can bring your ticket stub and get a discount"" Uh....... cool? Not helping us tonight.

 I saw this place on a food show about 3 weeks ago and had to try it. I didn't get a pie as I am from Chicago and knew it wasn't going to cut it. I ordered an Italian Hoagie. The big one. Now I knew right off the bat that our server was a bit light in the brains department, so I tried to talk slowly. We had two cocktails before the food came out. When it did arrive I was bent. This isn't going to fill me up? This is the large? I have been bent for a week wanting to rip this place. But I just looked at the receipt and we were only charged for a regular. So it was the servers fault. On to the sandwich. It was on a crispy roll stuffed with meat and veggies. The chips were homemade and crunchy. I would have appreciated the hoagie I saw on the tube. But it's all good. As I remember how tough it was to breath and stand erect without passing out at that age! ",0,0,1,0,0

 Food was quite good but service was poor. Food took way too long for simple sandwiches and burgers. I enjoy the side salad. Chicken panini was good, burger smelled good, and saw a BLT&E go out which looked great. At the end, I just couldn't get over the bad service. We had to take our check to the bar to be ring up.

 I miss Papa Del's, even if I live in a pizza wonderland, I remember Papa Del's fondly for where to go in Chambana if you wanted really good, really hearty, deep dish style pizza. The sauce if very flavorful, and the crust can take it. I prefer eat in, and never really got papa del's for delivery, but did carry out occasionally. It does suffer from sogginess when put in that cardboard box, better eaten fresh on location on a plate with a knife and fork. Not the cheapest pizza in Champaign, just the best. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We were booked four (Thur-Sunday) nights, originally in a regular room. We lucked out on a luxury suite with a strip view on the 58th floor by being upgraded free for my birthday. That definitely made the entire first-time experience in Vegas worth it! The hotel has a pool deck with a cafe/restaurant H2eau, fitness center, which we didn't not utilize but was nice to have. The pool area is very very nice, the pool is kind of small for a large hotel this size but the seating and lay-out areas were plenty to catch some sun. We also didn't get to use this feature due to chilly weather in November. Our suite had a small kitchenette, microwave, and fridge stocked with two bottles of water, and large enough to put our own drinks or food in. The closets light up automatically and have two doors per closet... (yes two closets!) Plenty of drawer space to put away clothes and belongings. I was a bit disappointed that our cocktail shaker didn't have a top and that our room was missing bath robes and slippers. No big, the staff was always very friendly and courteous in helping us get what we needed. The shuttles only go to the Whynn Hotel Resort and to the Caesar's Palace Forum Shops. However, if planned correctly you can always go to the Caesar's and walk on to the Bellagio or Planet Hollywood areas. If not, you have to hop a cab from one of the resorts on the strip. I recommend using Bell Trans shuttle for transport to and from the airport. If you have questions, you can also ask your shuttle drivers at the Trump about destinations on the strip. Oh, not to mention the bathrooms in the suites have a jacuzzi!!!!!! Nice plus to help you relax and rub down your sore feet after a night out on the town. I would definitely come to the Trump Las Vegas again, where there is value and luxury environment. It's also directly across the street from the Fashion Show mall, so you're a hop, and a skip away from great shopping nearby. A taxi from the airport will be approximately around $18-20 going locally, not on the highway. The best way to get around from here is to take the shuttles and walk or hail a cab. Just depends if you're willing to go for a stroll and see the sights or not. I would have loved to have tried their breakfast/ brunch near the main lobby. I hear they have buffets set up on certain busy days. We never quite got up early enough for this. ",0,0,0,0,1

 The food is ok, but if you like imitations mascaraing as authentic this may be your favorite spot. What is most interesting to me is not the food, it's the other patrons. If you are people watcher THIS IS THE MAIN REASON TO COME HERE. There majority of their clientele have something just a little bit different about them. It's pretty creepy, and very entertaining. If it's between this spot and Taco Bell, come here... unless you are in a hurry. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The Main just might be my favourite diner in the world. I've eaten there probably more than any other restaurant, and have tried nearly everything on the menu. Yes, I love it that much. To echo others on here, The Main has Schwartz's beat, hands down. Not only is their menu more substantial, the atmosphere more relaxed, and the staff friendlier, but the smoked meat is on par (or better) than the tourist-laden neighbour across the street. Starting with the smoked meat, compared to Schwartz's, the meat is a little leaner, smokier and has a spicy kick to it. Whereas Schwartz's is a little more marbled, tender and mellow in flavour. Both are good, just different. For my tastes (and for having no interest in waiting in ridiculous lines), I prefer Main's savory brisket. Beyond the smoked meat, they have one of best, if not the best poutine in Montreal. I kid not. The fries are large and tasty, the curds are fresh and substantial, and the gravy is rich and flavourful. Add smoked meat on top, and your mind will be blown. As I was quite the regular for a number of years, I'll run down my fav dishes / top recommendations for this Plateau beacon of goodness: 1. Smoked meat poutine - heaven 2. Beef ribs - the best deal in the restaurant. You get 3 giant, Flintstones-like ribs, slathered in delicious molasses-based sauce, fries, coleslaw and a pickle for $8.95. 3. Smoked meat sandwich - the classic. Spicy, smokey beef brisket on light rye. Definitely get a pickle or coleslaw on the side (this garlicy slaw is fantastic in it's own right) 4. Rib steak - good deal for the price for this well-portioned, tasty cut of beef. Garlic and spice rub on top is a must 5. Matzo ball soup - light, flavourful chicken/vegetable broth with large, delicate matzoballs. Great on a cold winter day or paired with a BLT for lunch. Honourable mention - Potato latkas (delicious and filling) I could really go on, but it's making me too hungry. I hope my review has persuaded some to pop into The Main while visiting Montreal (or if you live there, and for some reason have never been). Any of us who have lived in the neighbourhood know which deli is the real deal. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Root 174 is probably my favorite place to eat! I am lucky that this is so close to me. Will the GM is awesome! He is also super friendly, fun to talk to, excited about everything on the menu, and loves mountain bikes. I always feel so welcomed by him. I took my cousin there Saturday night and again it did not disappoint. She loved everything about it. They are definitely farm to table, putting together the freshest ingredients that compliment each bite. We split four apps (brussel sprouts coated with bacon pepper jelly, grilled romaine with cornbread croutons and a chipotle Caesar dressing, bone marrow br \ u00fbl \ u00e9e, and the beets special) all of it incredible. Will was very helpful in pairing a white wine for us to compliment our food choices. We then split the skillet chicken, with mole sauce, grape tomato salsa, and grits. Amazing!!! My cousin follows a gluten free diet and they had no problem making substitutions for her that absolutely did not compromise any of the delicious flavors. I don't eat out that often and when I do I usually end up at Root, because I am never disappointed! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Just got back from a lovely time in Vegas and I feel I really HAVE to review this buffet... No, really. My bitterness compels me, even several days after the fact. A friend of mine who had tried this buffet on a previous trip just raved and raved about it and was eager to have the rest of our group try it, all the while hyping it up to be ""the mother of all buffets!"" and ""so good you'll pass out!"" ...Yeahhhh, not so much. I felt bad for disappointing him, but after spending $50 for a single meal, I have a right to be a tad critical. So here's how it stacks up: PROS -Amazing food. The ingredients seemed fresh and well assembled, and every dish I tried was incredibly flavorful.... Gourmet indeed! (And the only reason this buffet gets three stars from me instead of one or two.) -Varied selection of dishes/cultural representations -Gorgeous atmosphere. I loved the clean lines of polished glass and stainless steel at every turn. And I appreciate the fact that each separate area has its own individual look and feel. -STREET TACO STATION! Someone, somewhere, heard my prayers on this. I was so excited to try my carnitas tacos that I almost ran into some poor, unsuspecting lady in my frenzy to get back to my table. However, by the time I was able to make it out of the crazy line for food, they were ice cold and the carnitas were hard. More on that below... CONS -Price. This mutha is EXPENSIVE. I mean, seriously, what is that about? I chose to try this the one time for the experience, but for what this buffet offers, it hardly seems worth it. I could go to the Wynn buffet or, to a lesser degree, Wicked Spoon to get more for my money (if the goal was, as it usually is, stuffing my face with yummy foods!). -Service lagged. Once my friend was able to flag down one of the servers to order our drinks, he was pretty good about seeing to our needs. Initially, though, he was nowhere to be found. We had just come from the Valley of Fire about 40 minutes outside of Vegas and were dying of thirst, but no one came to ask for our order for a good 10-15 minutes after being seated. Plenty of servers passed us and our conspicuously empty table that evening, but no one bothered to stop. -LINES! CRAZY, UNFORGIVING, TORTUROUSLY LONG LINES!!! As a few previous reviewers have noted, this place has an absolutely awful set up. I can see that if they just moved a few of the stations around the dining area (perhaps on the other side of the dessert bar, for instance), it would help immensely with the pileup of angry/hungry patrons. As it was, I waited a good hour on my feet, plate in hand, just for a chance to SEE what foods were offered! And this is after waiting almost an hour and a half just to get in!! The line hardly ever moved because the lady working the carving station moved at a glacial pace and honestly looked like she could cry from being overwhelmed with orders. I would've avoided the meat altogether, really, but after waiting that long to get a shot at my different options, I knew I had to at least try some ribs and the brisket. There would be NO going back, that's for sure!! I hardly ever got a chance to eat with my friends because we all stood in the massive line of doom at varying times. :( Boo... -Rude staff. The situation in line was intense, folks, as I have mentioned, but there was intensity from the kitchen, too. When I had finally made my way up to the carving station (hallelujah!), an older gentleman came right up in front of me and lifted his plate up, asking if the carving lady could put just the tiniest piece of chicken on it. While I was in NO MOOD to allow someone to cut in front of me, even I felt this sweet old man deserved a better response than what he received... One of the kitchen staff heard him and came forward, rudely yelling at him to get to the back of the line. He scowled in the general direction of the rest of us, too. I get that he may have been having a rough night with a bunch of unhappy patrons, but there was no need for that. I'm a big girl, and I can speak for myself, thanks. -Repeatedly out of foods. I missed out on mac and cheese and green tea mochi balls, people! And once they ran out, there was no replacing them. -THEY LIMIT YOUR PORTIONS. ...Think about this. It's a buffet, for crying out loud! For $50, I think I am entitled to pile my plate if I choose, but management came around and literally limited the quantity of meats per person. Not cool. Not cool at all! ",0,0,1,0,0

 The place is like subway/chipotle in the idea that you look over some glass and say what you want in your meal. They do have a variety of food to put in your meal which I give them props. However, I feel like I could buy a jar of sauce and cool noodles at home and they would be the same quality(I really am not that great of a cook). There noodles and/or sauce have a taste of plastic. I would give them two stars mostly for food taste but the two experiences I had there, I don't plan on returning. They were extremely slow, even when I was the only person there. Also, this happen to my co-worker, who is to nice to write a poor review. The manager there(I'm pretty sure she was the owner) decided that it was okay to insult the company that we work because she took some feedback about the experience we had as customers personally. I don't know if they happen to be having bad days on those visits but regardless it wasn't a good experience. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My husband and I visit Kaizen about 3 times a month. Being that we live minutes down the road, Kaizen has become our default place for sushi. There are not very many sushi places on the north side of town, but Kaizen is the best by far. We often take guests there, and they are mostly impressed. The service is sort of hit or miss. The waitresses speak very little English, so if you are not familiar with roll types that could be a problem. However, they are very nice and are quick to refill drinks. The service behind the sushi bar is good, and the rolls are served with a sense of urgency. I have always gotten fresh fish, and the vibe is nice, so I guess this means we will be returning :) The only reason I didnt give them another star is because of the loud music videos playing that do not match the scene what so ever.

 3.5 to be fair !!! Okay this place is hands down super trendy and romantic and just adorable inside ( I love all the mirrors). We had two mishaps without food being undercooked...they fixed both without giving us any grief and were very nice about the whole situation. Our service was great overall and they definitely made up for the food situation. We tried quite a few things- the kale salad is flippen fantastic. I'm not a huge meat eater so i was happy with the kale salad and brie potatoes we got also. My dear bf is the meat lover out of us and he was disappointed a little with the pork he got but said he would like to go back and try again so it was not alllll the bad. The desserts were sinful and delicious and paired well with some shots of peppermint schnapps :) I want my star rating to go up so we will give it another go around in the near future...there is definite potential to be found at The House Brasserie.

 My husband and I had lunch here about a month ago and we loved it. We went back around 4:00 and were really disappointed. I ordered filet and lobster which turned out to be 9 little cubes of steak and about 10 pieces of rubbery lobster. My husband ordered sushi and didn't get his sushi until after I finished eating. We watched my husband's sushi sit up at the sushi station for 10 minutes. The waitress was nice but really didn't seem to care. She knew that serving my husband so long after I served was wrong but didn't offer to adjust the bill which was $66.00. Really disappointed. When we left there were 3 hostesses and what looked like a manager who said nothing as we left. Needless to say we will be trying some other sushi places in the area next time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 So I REALLY want to like this place. The decor is awesome, service was average, nothing to complain about, nothing to rave about. Went for a late Sunday lunch. Got the Bacon Blue chips for an app. They were nice and crispy but had BBQ flavor powder all over them, like what you get out of the bag. Kinda strange, but edible. Boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich with ham (forgot what it was called). It was pretty good from the bite I had. The slaw on the side was good according to him, but can you really go wrong with sriracha slaw? I ordered the OMG burger and fries. The burger was anything but OMG... the bun was charred, the onions were supposed to be carmelized but were just transparent and bland(no seasoning or even S&P) mushrooms were just there, no texture, no flavor and the burger was way over done and dry also no basic salt & pepper. I barely ate half and gave the rest to my garbage disposal aka boyfriend. All it would have taken for this to be a great burger was some salt and pepper!! I hate to say it but I've had a better burger from a fast food chain. And we all know those aren't good... Maybe we went there on an off day or tried the right food (if it's on the menu it should be good, right?) Maybe we'll give it another shot. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The moment I stepped inside, I fell in love. Granted, I was a bit scared. I am a complete foreigner to the east side, but this place made my trip COMPLETELY WORTH ITTT! Sorry for the caps, I just love this place that much. It's a bummer, I don't live close by. First of all, I love that they are strong supporters/advocates of fair trade. Second of all, I'm not sure if it's always like this but when I first stepped in, it was DEAD QUIET. Luckily, I loved it since I had some studying to do! A great place to chat but a even greater place to get work done! The ambience is intimate with a hint of hipster. (: I ordered the creme brulee latte with stevia, almond milk, and sugar-free syrups. DELICIOUS! It tasted like a good ol' creme brulee latte with a deeper taste of almond milk (my fave). As I sat to get work done, I later got hungry & thirstier and ordered the vegan alien burrito with the veganaise (vegan mayonnaise) on the side. It was perfect: fresh, clean, AVOCADO-EY, crispy, delicious! The iced peach tea I got was also a great way to cool off in the suffocatingly horrible Vegas weather! I would absolutely recommend this place to everyone. The only thing that I would have preferred is for them to expand the space a little! When I entered, there was almost nowhere to sit down! Will definitely frequent this place as much as possible before going back to school! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I met a few friends there for a casual dinner and it was perfect. I've driven by this place 100 times and was excited to finally check it out! It's cute and simple inside, nothing over the top or super fancy. We started with the pork corn cakes which were delicious. The sauce had a little kick to it, which was was a nice surprise. We also split the bbq pizza and the baked potato. The pizza wasn't anything to write home about, but the potato was delicious! Smothered with more bbq pulled pork and cheese, it was delicious. If you're looking for a cute place to grab a casual dinner this is a great place! All the food coming out of the kitchen looked delicious and is affordable. I will definitely be back! ",0,0,0,1,0

 We have dined many times at Tuck Shop and had great meals and experiences each time, however, this review is specifically focused around a private party we held there recently. My husband and I were celebrating our recent wedding with an intimate private party and dinner of about 36 guests. We rented out the restaurant on a Sunday night (usually closed) and it was a great event from start to finish. My husband and I both wanted a memorable night that neither one of us had to be too hands on in coordinating as we are both very busy. Trust me on this, if you trust anyone, trust John. From the moment I contacted John at Tuck Shop he was focused on bringing together a night that would be special, unique and hassle free for us. The majority of our menu for the evening was customized, which was another special touch. We gave John our favorite dishes and wine preferences (favorite dish, favorite wine, etc.) left the rest up to him. It was definitely worth it as our guest raved about the food! My 80 year old grandmother said it was the best food she has had at a wedding--how many weddings do you think she has been to in 80 years?--pretty impressive stuff. :) It was one of those occasions you didn't believe would happen so flawlessly because it took so little effort on my part. John must've thought I was crazy contacting him the day before ""We are missing something right?"" He fielded my questions with patience and professionalism. We were not missing anything! It was an amazing evening, coordinated to the T, and I would recommend Tuck Shop for ANY private party. Every person in our party of 36 had an amazing evening. Tuck Shop was accommodating to whatever we could come up with, and it was a very memorable occasion for all. This is a great venue for any special event and I have no doubt we will be back there again in the future for a birthday or anniversary!!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 We came to this restaurant with very high expectations based on other reviews, but it was a bit of a disappointment. The waiters were polite, but brought our first course before bringing our cocktails. The main course was substandard - what you would expect from a cheap restaurant. And it was way overpriced.

 I am rarely on the SE side of Las Vegas, thus rarely gets to visit or review any businesses in the area. But Aug 17, 2010 was one of those rare days when I get to explore the SE side of Las Vegas. After ramen at Yokohama Kaigenro, then a brief stop at Seafood City, we eventually ended up here at Sunrise Coffee. From the outside it didn't look very impressive. However, that changed immediately after opening the door and stepping into this coffee house with a warm and inviting aura. The lady behind the counter was patient and cheerful in helping answer questions for us first timers. I ended up ordering their Superfruit Antiox ($4.45), and it was simply tasty and very refreshing. It definitely hit the spot on another 100+F day in Vegas. If you Yelp or check out Yelp reviews, you will undoubtedly also see their promotion for a free traditional cappuccino (2 oz. espresso, 2 oz. milk, 2 oz. foam, but their version is larger and served in an 8 oz cup), as long as you show them your UNLV student ID. This promotion is for Aug 2010, and I am sure they will have something else for each month of the year. If you are into latte art, they do that too, even on the free cup of cappuccino. The decoration is cheerful, and some of the walls are adorned with art works from local artists, just like at many coffee houses across the country. They also have a bookshelf full of books (ranging from techie books, aka A+ Study Guide, to various genres of novels), perfect for relaxing with some light reading material while enjoying a cup of joe or other tasty beverages. They also serve sweets, like danishes and cookies, which are $1 after 4pm (if I remember it correctly). But usually by that time of day, their selections are rather scarce (because their is only 1 cookie and 1 danish left when we arrived). While I was here with another Yelper, there was a decent group of ladies of varying ages + 1 man, who was part of a knitting club. It was cool to see that groups like that have a nice neighborhood hangout to meet at and enjoy their activities, and shooting the breeze. I give this cool coffee house a 4 stars for the friendly service, cool inviting ambiance, tasty beverages. I too wish they can xerox themself to another location in the SW, so I don't have to make quite the pilgrimage to enjoy the atmosphere and refreshing beverage. ",0,0,0,1,0

 So disappointing. Sochu is located in a shopping strip with plenty of parking. We decided to stop in for happy hour. The restaurant is trying a little too hard in terms of decor - white walls, windows blocked with red and black curtains, purple lights, white tables and chairs. It's nice, but a little over the top for my taste. After sitting in the restaurant area, we were told happy hour (3-6 pm daily, and reverse from 10:30 to midnight) is only available in the bar. No biggie, we move. After asking for a couple beers and wine that they were out of, we had a couple reasonably priced drinks. The food was lackluster. I did not enjoy the chicken lollipops - sauce was too thick and had little flavor. Orange puffs were pretty good, a little spicy with plenty of orange flavor, but simple. I did like the Sochu tofu - thought the tofu was fried well and dipping sauces were nice. After waiting awhile to catch the eye of the bartender, we ordered a couple more drinks and two more tapas. We received the drinks quickly, but after waiting 20 minutes and watching other tables who ordered after us receive their food, we figured we weren't getting more tapas. We flagged down the bartender, paid and left. Nice concept, but it just wasn't for me. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I love a good pub so when I heard so many positive things about Bishop and Bagg I couldn't wait to try it out. It is owned by the same people who run the Burgundy Lion so you expect it to be a quality pub given how good their other spot is. Even though it is fairly new it's already become a popular spot and once you have their food and drink you'll see why. They have a small cocktail list, good selection of beers on tap and a vast selection of scotches to taste. The cocktails are slightly on the expensive side for Montreal standards however they are strong so you do get your money's worth. I wasn't a fan of the Pimm's Cup which was a little on the weak side but that was the one exception. The Sidecar and Planter's Punch were both amazing and on the strong side. My friends who got the Bloody Caesar did say it was one of the better ones that they've had and that it was super spicy which is the way they liked it. Foodwise they have a smallish menu but they are one of those places that like to focus on doing a few items well as opposed to being too diversified. Don't expect food like burgers and wings. They take pub food up a notch. I ordered jerked cornish hen with plantain mash. Cornish hen can be very dry if not cooked properly but they got it just right and weren't scared to play with spice either. Take note that to order food and drink here they do it in the style of a proper English pub which means you go up to the bar to place your order which will then be brought to you. They don't take reservations so if you're going to be a group show up early. This place gets packed very quickly especially on weekends. Once you try it out though you'll understand why it's so popular. I'm definitely adding this pub to my list of preferred pubs and bars in Montreal. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Do not eat at this location! My friends and I used to go to this place all the time and it was great until they had the remodel. The service became lazy and the food took a turn for the worst. We ordered takeout back in March and we all had food poisoning the next day. We didn't go back for awhile for obvious reasons, but last night we decided to give it another try since it is the closest BWW to us. The results were disappointing. We ordered the chicken nachos, a nacho burger, and a chicken salad. We got nachos without chicken.. or cheese, a soggy burger, and the most disgusting lettuce I have ever seen. It shocks me that an established restaurant would send food out looking like that. I'm sad to say that we will never be eating from here again. Find another BWW and avoid this dump! ",1,0,0,0,0

Tonight however, we went to get yogurt as a family, and the guy working had closed up shop and locked the doors about 15 min early. It was 8:45p, and hours said open until 9p. He was cleaning the machines, turned around and smiled at us when we tried the door. Now, I don't have an MBA or anything, but I'm pretty sure it's bad business to close early and keep spotty hours. I am sure we'll go back, but we may start looking around for a new yogurt place. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I work close to this restaurant, so I was really hoping for awesome service. I mean, it'd be awesome if I had good sushi close to work, yeah? No. I walked and in placed my order (deep fried California, eel roll, Japanese lasagna) and was told it'd be about 30 minutes before my food was ready. I said sure, though I didn't understand why if only three tables had people. I returned 35 minutes later and was told the food was not done and would be a few more minutes. I was upset because I was kind of in a hurry, but decided to wait it out. 15 minutes later, out came my food. I asked the lady for extra ginger, and she said to me ""No, you don't. Thanks!"" FOR REAL. I took my order with me to work and decided I would judge based on the taste and quality of the food. I was pleased to find one of the containers had a ton of ginger, so that was good. That made me less unhappy. The food itself was mediocre at best, though the eel was good. Sucky food, bad service, and $32? No, thanks. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The last few months, it seems I went to get my car washed right before it would rain, without fail. I actually enjoy sitting in my car and going through the big blue tube. When I come out, I always am pleased with the shine. It does lack a bit of detail on the back end, especially where the trunk gate hides the dust. I ended up springing for the monthly pass of unlimited washes for $29.99. I'll make it a resolution to go at least once a week. Keep it clean. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We always make it a point to come here and have a meal or two while in VEGAS! We come here for the prime rib and they made changes to the menu since he last time we were here 2 years ago. For 12.99 we get a big ass prime rib with sides, salad OR soup and BEER!!! Get the Hefe Weiss beer!!!! Clean aftertaste with sweet malty flavor. I love Irish beer and this beer is pretty close to that awesome goodness! Food and beer came within 10-15 mins and boy it's GOOD! Prime rib was tender and cooked as requested. I devoured every single bit on the plate. Lol. Till next time Ellis! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Hubby and I have been here a few times for date night and with kids for dinner after work. We love this place, pizza is excellent and the atmosphere is very relaxing. They have a young guy singing, I believe he is the owners son. He is verrrry talented and I really enjoy listening to him sing. Nothing worse than listening to someone sing and you know they have no talent, but this is not the case with him. When we come to Pizza Heaven its always a treat for us. Good food and entertainment for sure. ",0,0,0,1,0

 No question one of the best hotels if not the best in Vegas. I'm sure the MO is great in other cities also. It stands out so much more so in Vegas given that it avoids the smoke filled casinos and associated crazy patrons that they attract. Checkin was a breeze as was the valet area. It made me appreciate how much more relaxing the lobby checkin MO was when we saw the hoards lining up at MGM and other hotels on the strip. Service is impeccable. Pool is fantastic. The fitness facilities are nice with free yoga and fitness classes. Mary Jane runs a particularly energy intensive yoga class versus a more meditative one offered by the other instructor Susan on the weekend. Mozen Bistro is pretty good but you will pay a bit for enjoying a smoke free dining experience. ",0,0,0,0,1

 EVERYBODY raves about this place so I finally went with a friend last week. I wish I hadn't heard so many good things prior to going because I was severely disapointed. Service was AWFUL. We came at 4 pm so we could get in abotu 3 glasses of wine before the $5 wine ended. WRONG. It took 30 minutes each time we ordered a glass of wine and I mean 30 minutes from the time we ordered it. When we went to order the 2nd glass of wine it was 2 minutes after 5 and luckily since we complained we still got it for the $5 price. The bruschetta also took an excessive amount of time to come and 2 of the cut pieces had fell of somewhere so we got jipped! Let me say I once was a server for many years. This place was not that busy and definetly not so busy that it takes 30 minutes to get a glass of wine. Food was ok. I didn't think the bruschetta was anything special like all my friends made it seem. I liked the salmon pesto one, but thats about it. I know this review sounds mean and since I have heard such great things I am willing to give this place another try. I will order a panini and hopefully get quicker service. If things are better I will be happy to revise my review- if not I will put Postino's in my OVERRATED category ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have been here many times, for many occasions over the last 10 years. Each and every time I have been pleased with the cakes and pastries. I can tell from recent reviews that Leopold not baking 100% of the time might be the problem. The prices have increased dramatically over the last 2 years, so I visit less often.I think businesses make this mistake of dramatically increasing prices when times are tight... But you cannot go wrong with the strawberry shortcakes, eclairs, or numerous other pastries that are delicious. ",0,0,0,1,0

 After a very long day and not wanting to cook dinner, I walked right over here after my sons hair cut. If you show them your receipt from Sports Cuts, you get 10% off your order. I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and it was delicious. The pizza itself was bigger than the normal chain pizzas and smelled very wonderful. It was nothing but cheesy goodness drizzled in sauce. I couldn't wait to get home and dig in. It was calling my name the entire drive home. Now, I have a dog at home. She knows to stay away from the table when we're eating but was hovering over us the entire time at dinner, then she finally jumped up and snatched the pizza right out of my hand. I guess she wanted some of the deliciousness too. We didn't have any leftovers after we were done since my boys loved it that much. We will definitely be back. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Hmmm... We've been here twice, and if I had posted a review after the first time, it would have been 4 stars. We tried the short rib grilled cheese (good), the pot stickers (very good), the Fat Choy burger, & the PBBLT. Now, I consider myself a professional porker from the old school, but in order to be considered a contemporary ""foodie"", one has to venture out into the brave new world of exotica featured on the Food Network, and since ""pork belly"" and ""bacon"" are considered practically synonymous, I was actually anxious to give it a try. I am no longer anxious. It's not that it tastes bad, it's just that it's a little pork with a lot of creepy, greasy, mostly raw fat. How is it that the fat layers on bacon fry up crispy, chewy, and delightful, and this just seems like the stuff that would make you refuse to eat until your mother trimmed it off your meat for you? Yuck. Don't know what the fuss is about, but I'm not blaming it on Fat Choy. I assume this is the way it's supposed to be, and it's just not for me, along with blue-veined cheeses and anything with the word ""tartare"" in the title . Anyway, what we did have was hot and fresh, and the service was fine- one obviously experienced waitress named Tammi who was working like crazy and appeared to be training a younger one who seemed a little lost. All fine. However, we returned this week and had brunch. Dropping a star because the hollandaise on the Eggs benedict was salty, runny, and I expect pre-packaged, and the eggs were overdone. The potatoes on, the other hand, were golden, crispy, and delicious. Most everyone else's food was fine, but one poor Sad Sack ordered waffles, and they were so limp and pale you would believe they were cooked by an Englishman. They boil everything! However, it should be noted that the waffles we saw being served a little later to neighboring diners looked brown and toasty. So go ahead and order them, but first ask yourself if you feel lucky today . Added to this was the fact that they weren't that busy, Tammi was still plugging away, and the no-longer-new girl was still lost. While as a fan of The Walking Dead it was kind of fun watching her wandering around, bumping into walls with a vacant stare and a thin trickle of drool running down her chin, it was pretty much impossible to get a refill from her. Must have been hired for her looks. On the other hand, maybe not. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Pesto Prima is my new neighborhood go-to for casual breakfast, lunch, coffee and general relaxation. Don't let the location fool you - the strip mall at the SE corner of Hayden and Roosevelt is indeed the right place - and awesome food and customer service awaits! I love eating there because: 1) Nathan, the owner, and his staff are so incredibly friendly, welcoming, and helpful to all of their guests...They provide helpful recommendations and happily accommodate finicky customer requests (including my boyfriend who likes an absurd amount of caramel in some sickeningly sweet ""coffee"" beverage he orders.) They don't serve their customers, they take care of them. 2) The food is fresh, no fuss, and simply delicious. They make pretty much everything. The turkey or chicken in your tasty sandwich? They roast it themselves. The pesto aioli and hummus, the tuna, potato and pasta salads? Yup, they make those too. The Pesto crew takes pride in their food and it shows. 3) The unpretentious vibe. If you've grown weary of the Scottsdale brunch / lunch scene, Pesto is the perfect alternative. The decor is no frills, bright and spotless. There are old peeps, young peeps, guys in suits, nerds, blue collar workers, cool dudes in flip flops, lost tourists from the UK...everyone is welcome here. And customers actually acknowledge one another! With free wifi and good tunes played at a respectful volume, Pesto's a low-key place to get away from the crowd, hunker down and get some work done too. 4) The prices are beyond reasonable. And now they deliver - lounge lizards rejoice!!! The selfish me wants to keep Pesto a secret, but they deserve the good word to spread. So beat the crowd and enjoy before the throngs converge....I'll see you there! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Yes, this is a sandwich shop that I'll be back to time and time again. The Yelpers are right, it's completely overwhelming. But have no fear, a trusty Which Wich employee will see your bewildered look and come to your rescue. I read the reviews, and braced myself before I entered the sandwich emporium. I'm sure that you could see the whites all the way around my eyes when I looked at the menu and selection of bags. The girl behind the counter came over to me, welcomed me and then talked me through ordering exactly what I wanted. She said that the Italian grinder is the most popular, and for good reason. So that's what I got. I liked the different options and sizes that separates this place from Subway. It is a little more expensive - but if you're careful, you can get away with a great deal. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. I had avocado added to mine, and that was my best decision all day. It was that beautiful light green, and piled throughout my sandwich! This is an excellent choice for a lunch stop. Like subway on steroids (but with brownies and Rice Krispies instead of cookies). ",0,0,0,0,1

 i consider this the best buffet in town compared to old country & hometown. there is a large selection of all types of food. there is no skimping when it comes to food selection. they have a large dessert bar also with sugar free desserts. the desserts are awesome, not just the standard boring kinds like hometown. all the food has been really good. the lunch price is about $8. this does not include your drink. drinks are another $1.80. dinner is about $10, not including your drink. service has always been good. the food is always great.

 A neighborhood ethnic place in yet another ubiquitous strip mall. I thought the food was good and the owners charming. I had the lamb shank with vegetables and cous cous. I thought is was good not great. It needed more seasoning and I relied on some red spicy sauce we all passed around to give it dimension. If I am ever in that neck of the woods again, I would definitely try one of the tangines. We need to support places like this and enjoy the diversity in our neighborhoods! ",0,0,1,0,0

 On our way out of Phoenix and made a special trip to Lux- I totally appreciate the killer finds on Yelp. As a frequent traveler I have found some of the best, hard to find, off the grid bizarre located food spots. Lux definitely is one of them and is high on the return list for: *Amazing baked goods *Hysterical cute man running the register *Fab gal taking barista orders and facilitating the crazy line. Her customer service was spot on. It's a bummer (yes my use of antiquated terms shows my age) that Lux has some frequent patrons that seem slightly spoiled, rude and frankly full of themselves - Future Lux patrons ignore the whining narcissistic reviews, clearly these people have no perspective on what is important in our world today - LUX is damn good coffee and incredible food- Wish Lux had another location closer to us in San Diego but then again no, it would ruin the uniqueness!

 CHOCOLATE CAKE SHAKE - Wowza! I really dig this place. I am amazed every time that I go in this restaurant, it runs like a well oiled machine. The employee's at the registers are very knowledgeable about the menu, the staff when you go to pick up your food all seemed like they really enjoyed and wanted to be at work. It's just an over all happy environment (even when they are extremely busy.) Recommendations: First off - you must, and I mean MUST get the Chocolate Cake Shake! If you can't tell I am a BiG fan! - Chopped Salad is delightful, consists of chopped lettuce and small pasta noodles with chicken, bacon, cabbage, tomatoes and house dressing. (It also comes with onion and gorgonzola cheese which I had taken off.) The salad also comes with one of their (spectacular) warm lemon poppy seed muffins. - Grilled Tuna Sandwich, tuna w/lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce. (You must love tuna to enjoy this sandwich.) -Big Beef, be prepared as this is a very large sandwich. It's Italian beef on french bread. The beef is well flavored and if you add cheddar cheese or mozzarella to the sandwich it is out of this world. - Onion rings: They are not to thick or thin and they are not over-battered like most onion rings are. They are light, crispy and awesome! I have yet to try the hot dogs, I plan to on my next Portillo's adventure. Hope you stop in and enjoy this place as much as I do. --One last time.....get the cake shake!-- ",0,0,0,0,1

 ok. so they are doing somethings right i guess. they are friendly, the place is clean. they have a pretty creative, extensive menu. that said i wasn't impressed enough to ever go back. i went there because i was walking my dog and wanted to stop for lunch they had outdoor seating so i thought i'd give it a shot. they are very chintsy (if that's even a word lol) with their dressings. my sandwich was mostly bread. i had the Count of Monte Chase-O sandwich which features ham, turkey, swiss cheese and strawberry preserves. unique huh? you couldn't tell, like i said, i tasted only the bread. if they would be even a little more generous with the lettuce, onions, meats and condiments. i like a sandwich that is as much on my face as it is in my mouth. this wasn't it. nothing fell out of this sandwich!

 Super popular hip restaurant in the Capitol area of Madison. Not crazy about the hour long waits, but I did enjoy the farm to table offerings. Their seasonal lemonade was fantastic - mine was cherry raspberry. For appetizers we had the mac and cheese made with 10 year old cheddar. I realize the cheese was aged but I think it would have benefited from a blend of cheeses to make the flavor more complex. The artisan bread was tasty, but the style was more homemade than artisan. They were rolls like the kind you could make in your oven at home. Truffle popcorn is a huge trend right now, and I was glad to try their rendition. It was natural popcorn, a little salty and a hint of truffle. I think I would've preferred more of a dunking of truffle. Finally, the cheese curds. AMAZING! The breading was light and the dipping sauce complemented nicely. For our entrees we had the warm farro salad and the fried chicken and waffle. The warm farro salad was great - a lot of fresh vegetable ingredients and a nice tangy vinegarette dressing. The fried chicken was a bit disappointing. The batter was laid on very thick and so the chicken was encrusted with this coat of batter that didn't have the unevenness or crispy texture you'd get with a light hand battered chicken. Overall, a good restaurant - high end and hip with good farm to table choices. Next time, i'll stick with more vegetables. ",0,0,0,1,0

 A gem you wouldn't expect to find in an old, dingy casino slightly off strip. The Oyster Bar has a true following--and if you attempt to eat here, be prepared for a bit of wait. The counter doesn't serve more than 20 (at most!) at a time--but I assure you--it's worth the wait. Regardless of what you order--their dishes are cooked to order directly in front of you--and you will have to do everything in your power to not drool all over your setting. Each dish is loaded with tons of seafood. Combine with with the butter, spices, and base they let cook in front of you--and your poor stomach will sit in gluttonous anticipation for the next 20 minutes. I've been here twice--each time ordering the Etouffee. It's amazing! It's a wonderful creole/french soup that's wonderfully spiced and loaded with seafood. It's the less creamy version of the Oyster Bar's Pan Roast. I happen to enjoy the soup more because it's less rich than the Pan Roast--but I've had the Pan Roast--and it's certainly nothing to scoff at. It's amazing! Just a tad too rich for me. You can spice up your dishes the way you like. I like my spice and generally order a 7. Spicy, but still enjoyable. I've tasted an 8...and while delicious...definitely left me gulping down a lot more water than I wanted. I've seen orders of the shrimp scampi and the linguine a la vongole--and i can tell you that even in my bloated state, wanted to order them. They look crazy good. Oh--and before I forget...these bowls are huge! Please share. If you can finish it on your own--you're a champ. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've never been here and just stopped because we were hungry and just happen to be driving by a sushi joint that offered AYCE. We figured why not? I was actually pretty impressed. What we demolished: * Shrimp Tempura - Not my fav. It had a bit of a weird taste. Nonetheless still good. * Shumai - these were deep fried and were heavy. * Yum Yum Roll - Yum Yum indeed! * Sugar Dad Roll - I accidentally ordered this, but it was good! * Spider Roll - a classic favorite. How can you mess this one up? * Sake Nigiri - The freshest fish in town. Seriously it was amazing!!!!! * Harry Potter Roll - Very vinegary in taste. Jade and I were not impressed. * Pacific Roll - Coconut and Sushi.. whaaaa?? I definitely will order this again! Pros: * They had a few interesting specialty rolls (such as the Pacific Roll). Plus! * Very clean interior and friendly staff * Stamp card available ! * Seriously the freshest Salmon! Thick cut and Fresh! * I loved their presentation & how they combine numerous orders on 1 plate. Cons: * Parking can be a pain. * Harry Potter Roll & Shumai in my opinion were a no go. Overall: This place could have given me super crappy service and have overcharge me on AYCE, but serving me Sake Nigiri of this quality would still give them a 5 star! I'm really picky with my Sake Nigiri (my fav) and seriously this place had the freshest I have ever tried! Jade and I are pretty big fans of Sushi and I think I can speak for the both of us by saying we definitely recommend this place to others. Tips: * have some Sake Nigiri! * Experiment with their Specialty Rolls. * Just in case they forget, make sure to ask for their Stamp Card. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I will rate 1. Hotel, 2. Casino, 3. Kids venue, 4. Overall quality 1. Hotel rooms are okay 3.5 stars. The elevator system gets (1-generous heavy weighted star). We stay here every year and its the same thing every year. When 10:30 to 11 AM rolls around, everybody is trying to get out of the building, however the elevators are so slow that it takes 40-minutes to get down. By the time it gets to your floor they are already full. If you don't have luggage, take the stairs, but if you do, prepare to wait for a ride and stop on every floor.!! THE ELEVATORS SUCK.!!!!! 2. Smokey Casino is okay, nothin special, 3-stars. 3. (2-stars) The smokey mid-way is old and could use a overhaul, but my 5-year old son knows no difference and loves it. The circus acts are entertaining too, this is why we come back every year. Very crowded so get used to bumping into folks. Adventure dome is fun too, but pricy. (Not smokey) The rides seem a little old and a little young for my 5-year old, so we didn't spend much time there this year. (3-stars). 4. Overall, this place is okay (2-stars), very smokey, pricy food, dirty, old; nice upgraded rooms but getting out during checkout time is a challenge because of the HORRIBLE ELEVATOR system. Circus Circus gets a well deserved 2-stars mostly because of the smokey venue and horrible elevators. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Finally went to Deli Roma yesterday and so glad i did. I've been meaning to go for a while but, always forget about it because of it's location. It's small but cool at the same time. All the Italian nostalgia in there is fun to look at while you wait. We got a veggie muffaletta, grilled panini, and a Chicago style Vienna all beef hot dog. Veggie Muffaletta ($5.25)~ Wow! So much flavor with the olives, 2 kinds of cheese, and the in house olive dressing. Served on a 5"" round Pane Mariano bread (my new favorite bread). Great price for a huge sandwich. Grilled Panini ($6.49)~ It was the panini of the week, not sure what it was. It had 2 kinds of meat( ham and salami i believe) and cheese. The focaccia bread was grilled to perfection. We got the order to go and it was still super hot when we got home! Tasty sandwich with a TON of meat in there! Chicago style Vienna all beef hot dog ($2.75)~ Very good dog with all the fixings. Only complaint was that it was not very warm but that's OK with a hot dog i guess. If you can find this place you need to go! The mailman was eating lunch when we were there.

 The Bally's of today represents a Las Vegas of yesterday: A name for all to know, a location desired more than most, a mid level property for the people. Heydey no longer, more and more properties both new and renovated are creeping past Bally's as the decades roll along. Even then, Bally's remains a solid choice for the ever changing face of The Strip. As a part of the Caesars Entertainment family, Bally's is a part of the largest gaming corporation in the world. Total Rewards lovers can earn and spend their points here where the comps are easier to utilize than higher end properties. The casino itself is rather average by today's standards with a solid array of slot machines and just under 100 tables. I'm pleased to report Spanish 21 is available here and a beefed up a poker room is available for hold 'em lovers. The resort itself is as massive as it looks. Home to nearly 3,000 rooms, there is a good shot that there will be rooms here than a lot of the smaller places that sell out quickly. While the room rates will always fluctuate, the retail side of the hotel is reasonable for Vegas standards, especially when considering the middle of the Strip location. Hotel dwellers take note: If you're going to be situated in the North Tower, be prepared for Las Vegas circa 1995 rooms. If at all possible, try to get a Jubilee room, the equivalent of the GO series at the Flamingo. It's contemporary, modern, and a true surprise for Bally's visitors. Concierge is on point as always, a huge plus considering the grade of the resort. The best part of Bally's is also the most surprising: Major upgrades on the food front. Once considered the boring laughing stock of the local culinary scene, Bally's is now boasting one of the better steakhouses in the mid strip in Bally's Steakhouse (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ballys-steakhouse-las-vegas). Adding to the meat is their renovated buffet, the classic Sterling Brunch (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sterling-brunch-las-vegas) which has upgraded furiously not just in price ($40+ per person) but in the abundance of luxurious choices (especially on the sea food front) as well. BLT is set to come in sometime in the next few months and other quick bite businesses (::coughs:: chains!) will likely surface their lots come 2014. What's next for Bally's? Who knows. A face lift is most likely given the overhaul of Caesars property renovations but something tells me it'll all start from the inside out first. Be sure to enjoy Bally's before another classic Las Vegas property joins the present. ",0,0,0,1,0

 They have busy weekends and I recommend it for little kids like 7 and under on week days. The big kids don't really stay in there designated areas. I wouldn't expect them too, because of just how WILD kids can get.

 My boyfriend loves craft beer, so we had to stop my NoDa when visiting Charlotte. It was great! We sat at the bar and ended up splitting 3 flights so we could try everything on tap. The beer was great! I was a fan big of the Hop, Drop 'n Roll, What Gose Round and Conroy's British IPA. The bartender was great, and gave us a lot of helpful insight about Charlotte and NoDa. It is dog friendly, so a few people had their dogs in the tap room. I love dogs, so it didn't bother me. They had a few food trucks outside that you could order from and bring the food in to eat.

 I was expecting to be giving Joey's Pizza more stars, but based on my husband and I going out of our way to ""try something different"" - that different did not turn out so great. I've had this place bookmarked because of the good reviews and proximity to my home. There's not a lot on the East Side worth going out of your way for, but some things are really diamonds in the rough. Joey's is not. Ordered three medium pizzas for $21.99 for take-out. The girl on the phone took my order and repeated it back to me. 1 Pizza with hamburger topping 1 Pizza with ham and mushrooms 1 Pizza with pepperoni and jalepenos We got two pizzas correct and the other came as a HAWAIIAN pizza. They put pineapples and ham instead of ham and mushrooms. Okay, it's an honest mistake, but I've ordered this type of pizza from Marco's, Domino's, Metro, Pizza Hut, and Little Ceasers, and never have any of them eff;d it up. Maybe I could over look the wrong pizza, but then when it comes down to it, the pizzas were just ""meh"". The cheese was boring, no diversity, just straight out mozzarella, and gooey-gross messy. The first time around it was okay, heated up the next day it was particularly yucky. Also - I got a bad stomach problem that night and woke up *ahem* having to go to the restroom. I spent the rest of the night in and out. I decided it must have been the pizza, but my husband did not get sick. Then I decided to experiment and took all the pepperoni and jalapenos off the pizza I ate and had it sans-toppings. I did not get tummy trouble after that. Who knows - the sickness may have been something else I ate, but considering the meh quality, the wrong pizza, and my late-night bathroom ventures, I will not be ordering from Joey's Pizza again.

 LOVE this place! You can literally stay at this place and not go anywhere else! Studio 54 and Tabu' are here for dancing. Lots of nice eats from sushi to steak. And cheap eats from New York Pretzel, Nathan's Hot Dogs and let's not forget Fat Tuesday pina colada smoothies served in what could be used as a portable urinal for both sexes. Gross! But true.... Pools are awesome! A pool for everyone. First there's the party pool where dance music is playing while the 20's crowd bob up and down in the pool with plastic beer bottles. Go early since that's the only time you'll be able to swim. The 30's pool, still close enough to the party pool but if you have stretch marks and a belly this is the one to go to. The central pool, usually for those who don't venture out into the other pools. The back pool, I noticed for seniors and much more quiet than the other pools. Then the FUN POOL!! There's a lazy river here that has a current AND there are waterfalls!! Great for kids but fun for just lazing around.... Rooms are comfortable, stylish and have standard amenities. They had a cool stylish sofa that is great to sit on and feels like therapy having a conversation on it. Marble floors in the bathroom that I almost slipped on, but nice toilet paper. The lotion was actually really nice too! I'm big on lotion! This hotel has a Monorail station that goes clear across the North part of the Strip and ideal for staying out of the heat. A 24 hour pass is $9. Not bad for cruising through the hotels on the strip. I would probably stay at this hotel again! www.MGMGRAND.com ",0,0,0,0,1

 Very friendly service, but my order is wrong 50% of the time. The store is always clean and I never have to wait in line. The staff is very accommodating as well. My only complaint is that when I order any but just a bagel and shmear, they get it wrong. I've tried to order the Bagel Thin Eggwhites Southwest Turkey-Sausage a couple of times and it was no good. The first time it was so soggy with too much salsa and cream cheese and missing the pepper jack. The second time I ordered I asked for easy on the salsa a cheese and only got the sausage and egg white with nothing else. It's kinda frustrating. So I say come here for a quick bagel & shmear, but skip anything more complicated than that. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Mainland is good if you don't really know what good Asian food is. I understand its ""fusion"" but I find that that term is more often used for a conglomerate of the strongest of flavors Asian cuisine has to offer, typically the saltiest, sweetest, sourest, etc. Rarely, if ever, is it used to describe an accurate and enlightening combination of cuisines. In any case, Mainland offered exactly the fusion I'd expected. I had the crispy noodle wonton soup, which tasted great until half way through when my body knew to stop before the sodium had absorbed all the water in my body and I shriveled up. As if casino air wasn't bad enough for my hydration. Plus, I come from the SGV, so $14 for a bowl of noodles is ludicrous when I can hit up a Garden Cafe or other such spot and get a better version for $5.95. Guess I'm spoiled. My co-worker had the pork-chop, which was served in a bowl, and when she asked for a knife and fork they gave her a butter knife. ahahaha....On the up side, the wontons in my soup were pretty darn good and unlike my ghetto joints here at home, had all pork and shrimp in them.

 I purchased two subs (roast beef and pastrami), my first time buying anything and I will never go back. The bread isn't all that fresh to me and neither is the meat. It smelled like it was just starting to spoil. The service was bad. She needed more pickles while making my sandwich so she put her hand in a container and grabbed a handful while dripping pickle juice every where then she used the same plastic glove wet with pickle juice to fix my sandwich.

 Giovanni's is the sort of business that demands I stop what I'm doing and write a glowing - albeit limited - review. I'm ashamed at having waited this long to do so. My GF and I were in town for the New England debacle around Halloween and stayed at a nearby hotel. A quick Yelp check revealed that Giovanni's was THE place for pizza in the area. So we ordered. Then we ordered again. After that, we order some more. I can't rave enough about how large, delicious and filling their Texas Roadhouse Steak hoagies are. 15 minutes after calling in, my order arrived. I swear I heard carols of angels singing as I unwrapped the paper. Inside were steak, onion rings, provolone cheese, fried onions, peppers and mushrooms lathered in a spicy Santa Fe sauce. The memory stimulates my salivary glands as I type. Need I go on? But don't stop reading now. Because the pizzas are also large and tasty: Freshly baked bread, excellent sauces and a wonderful assortment of meat toppings. Corporate pizzeria conglomerates: Are you taking notes? Because if the owners ever think to expand, Giovanni's will...well, eat your lunch. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Chicken basil was very greasy and had almost no basil in it. I ordered spice level 7 and found it just spicy enough for my taste. I walked in and placed my order to-go around 8:30 pm. They were very prompt in making my order. It's just too bad it was so greasy. It gave me a tummy-ache later in the evening.

 Good place for the twenty something's and young thirties. Only go there if you are ready to party. The Sunday rehab music is sooooo loud that you can't relax, especially if you are trying to recover in your room from Saturday night. The party ends at 6 but the music was on until 8 or 9 pm. On Monday they have Relax at the smaller pool. The other days they have music at the pool which creates a cool party vibe. The pool is huge with a beach area, slide for kids (and big kids), water fall, swim up gaming, and lots of lounge areas. Big huge pool with plenty of cabanas and beds to rent. Gorgeous landscaping with plenty of palm trees to shade you from the hot summer desert weather. $15 margaritas at the pool with strict security all over. The room as okay (Paradise Tower), nothing to write home about. We had a king suite with only a shower but the shower could fit 10 people. The place is a little run down (chipped wood, things falling apart, old furniture). Some cleaners must be blind because the first room we got was unacceptable. They rectified it by moving us to another room. I loved the casino and feel of the whole casino area. There are tons of memorabilia cases and rock n' roll artifacts. I loved walking around just to see what they had up. The restaurants were good and offer great deals with your players card. Check their website for more info on the times and what they have to offer because they don't tell you those things. Lucky 24/7 and Pink Taco were my favs. The night club seemed good by all the people lined up to go in. I didn't check it out though. They had poker tournaments and really tight slots. Some table minimums were $5. This hotel was good. Not really a place to come and relax. If your coming with your boys or girls to get wasted and party this is definitely the hotel to stay at. If you are going to Vegas with your family or just want to relax then try another joint. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I had to find a club appropriate shirt pretty last minute. It had to be red for a charity theme. I tried Mastrionni Fashions, which has served me well a few times before. No luck. Then I went near Boca Park. I figured my odds of success would increase by searching at a larger retail area. First, I tired Banana Republic across the street. They had one red button-up shirt for $60, it felt very thin and cheaply made. Then since I was there, I tried the Gap next door. No surprise, even worse luck. Almost giving up, I shot across the street to the Men's Wearhouse. I walked in and was greeted by a nice salesman. I told him the situation, and he was eager to help. He measured my neck, arm length and chest. Then he grabbed a solid red shirt for me. It was dead-perfect. They had a 2 for 1 sale going on. He showed me the section of shirts that would fit me, and I grabbed another shirt that I liked. It was also a perfect fit. The shirts here were at least three times the quality of the crap that Banana Republic was trying to sell. Wrinkle free FTW!! And at two-for-one, they came out to about $40 each. They also had just received some great hockey sweatshirts and jackets that were also two-for-one. I grabbed two great Rangers items for my dad and got some Christmas shopping done while I was there. Everyone from the salesman to the lady ringing me up were extremely friendly and helpful. The salesman steamed my shirts and another salesman was trying to give me crap about the Rangers, suggesting I bought some Red Wings stuff instead. It gave me a pretty good laugh. In summary, I would definitely return to this Men's Wearhouse for future purchases. I was taken care of from the moment I stepped through the door, to the moment I left. Plus, they aint just whistlin' Dixie when they ""guarantee"" you'll like the way you look. How often do you get to read a review with the words ""whistlin' Dixie"" in it?? ",0,0,0,0,1

 I like this place. Good atmosphere and good sushi. The reason for 1 star is that it is advertised as gluten free friendly. My sister has celiacs, so to double check we called to make sure. They said yes! We are! When we got there (after ordering a bottle of wine) we were informed that there was not options for her. When we talked to the manager, he got a really big attitude. Bad experience. It's just frustrating that they market as friendly, but have no options. Educate yourselves. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I used to come here a lot for lunch, which is a good deal. I've never been to this location for dinner until last night. It definitely gets more crowded for lunch than dinner. The food is excellent. We had the pan seared scallops ($29) and the seared chilean sea bass ($38) which were both very tasty. Also the sizzling mushrooms as a side ($8), which were also very good. I love mushrooms. The best part was the shrimp cocktail ($15) which comes with dry ice! Really cool effect. The service was very attentive but I got the constant ""upsell"" vibe from our server. She kept pushing certain products and wanted us to join the frequent diner club. I know this place is a chain but they need to let their server lay off and be themselves. The fish tank is really cool and makes for good conversation. If it seems to pricey for dinner, check it out for lunch where the prices are less and the portion sizes are about the same. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Twilly - absolutely INSANE - had a dream about it the other night and I can't believe these things go so well together. How did I come about stepping in here? Well I dragged my husband here to see the antiques in the marketplace and the Steelers garb caught his eye & thats all she wrote. The owner approached us and talked with us about the Steelers fan stuff all over and told us about the twilly. We walked around the marketplace for about 20 minutes - then we couldn't stand it anymore and bee lined back to Pittsburgh Willys to get one. Good god it was fantastic - I ate it with a fork & knife so it would last just a little bit longer. Also, their employees, very nice and pleasant. Love the canned soda choices too. I had a Dad's creme soda - MY FAV!! The owner told us about their 2nd location opening by downtown chandler - we will be sure to visit. You - need - to - visit - even if it isn't for a twilly.

 I was at MGM and decided to grab a bite to eat before the airport. This new section at MGM has many places, but it's kinda hidden.

 My boyfriend and I were so excited to hear that there was a yogurt place going in. We were even more thrilled to hear that they stay open until 10 in the summer! We are definite night owls so we were more than ready to appreciate the later hours. Unfortunately we've driven by around 9:15 - 9:30 several times now and every time we do they already have the stools and chairs picked up and the couple times we ignored the signs and went in anyway we've felt less than welcome. If you want to close at nine then close at nine! Also really frustrated with the lack of water availability. Can't believe they don't offer free cups to quench your thirst. Not worth it. Definitely not somewhere we feel like we can go to detox and chill at the end if the day like we hoped it would be. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was actually hesitant at first to rent from this place because of the really bad reviews and low ratings, but I'm actually glad that I did! Being a pretty broke college student/career changer, I rented from them during Thanksgiving week to visit family in South Carolina and mostly because they were the cheapest company when booking cars on Expedia. When I arrived at the airport lot, the driver of the shuttle, Jim (hopefully I got his name right!) was really helpful giving me directions to a nearby mall and back to SC and even wrote down the directions for me! The guys at the counter were really nice too- They were even having a pretty nice conversation with the customers before me who were travelling from NY. The check-in process was pretty fast and easy for me as I had already purchased insurance from Expedia (where I booked the car) and I think I got my car in less than 10 minutes after I arrived at the counter. The cars available in the lot were mostly brand new (2011-2012 models). When I was driving to the mall and SC, I followed Jim's directions and they were right on! I just want to thank you guys for making my stay in SC a bit easier and Jim for giving me directions to all of these destinations! I highly recommend them and hopefully this review will make some of you people wondering if they should rent from them a bit at ease. ",0,0,0,0,1

There were 4 large stuffed (spinach, crab) mushrooms with a huge shrimp on top. For the main course I had the Osso Bucco - which is braised pork (cooked 6 hours) and a side of homemade gnocchi. The pork was incredibly tender. I can't wait to go back!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 walk in and BOOM you know your in an authentic Detroit run place. The manager or maybe the owner (im not sure) was ringing people up and you can tell he is definitely from Detroit. They have a cool map of Detroit and some push pins with a sign saying ""put it where you come from"" I dont think he would of liked it if i asked him to pull out a map of Ohio haha. O-H. but moving on. The place is small but has good seating and pretty good prices. The food itself was AMAZING. I got 2 Detroit Coney Dogs -onion. Simple i know but its easy to mess the chili on it up, and they sure didnt. The guys were awesome who were making the food. Very polite and everyone seemed happy to be there. I live right around the corner and ill absolutely be back. oh and btw they have a 10% check in marked off your bill. I just threw the difference in the tip jar. I consider this to be a nice hidden gem. I hope they expand and get some more recognition. Thanks guys. ",0,0,0,0,1

 The food isn't bad (usually), and they have a decent selection of beers. But I was expecting (based on the website and pictures) a really hot staff. It is NOT. This place might be amazing if you are a woman, I wouldn't know, but I hear the hot guys in kilts there can't be beat anywhere downtown? Maybe the place to take your BF to show him you're open minded, while drooling over the bartender? The guys In kilts are friendly, cool, and make me feel a bit like I need to get to the gym. Honestly, it's probably better for women than men, because the guys on staff are good looking built enough to make me extremely jealous. The female staff is about what you would expect at a out of the way Hooters in the middle of nowhere or something, only with more tattoos. They are in the ""decent, but debatable if I'd even date that"" category. The food is debatable. It's a traditional UK'ish menu, which isn't a bad thing. But it depends on how it's prepared, so when the right cook is working it's brilliant, and worth every penny. When the wrong cook is working, it might as well be microwaved frozen food. Honestly, if you at CityScape already and are a guy just looking to see hot staff, you are probably better off at Copper Blues or Gypsy Bar. But, the female staff is friendlier at the other bars in CityScape. At Tilted Kilt the female staff sort of act like they hate the fact they are wearing those outfits and hate the fact they have to serve you. Not a good thing for a theme restaurant. ",0,1,0,0,0

 great steaks at a great value compared to other strip places. Free mashed potatoes and salad were forgettable but cant really complain if they are free. Also some nice happy hour deals ($5 top shelf cocktails). On top of that they currently have a half off groupon which is just about the best discount to quality of food ratios you will find in Vegas right now. As far as other steakhouses in this price range, I prefer The Barrymore and Envy for their higher level of sides (which are not free) and a nicer selection of non-steak entrees. But their steaks are very comparable. One thing to note, my wife and i actually had a difficult time ordering enough food to use all of our 50 for 100 groupon since she ordered a burger instead of a steak. We ended up ordering 2 desserts even though we were completely stuffed to use the rest of our groupon voucher. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I highly enjoyed my dining/drinking experience here. You can enjoy this place for HH, a romantic dinner for two, or Sunday brunch. They do it all! We went for HH so my review is based on service at the bar. The bartender was super nice (I think his name was Jeff)! He engaged in conversation with us, offered his recommendations on food, kept our water glasses full and reminded us before HH ended to fill up our drinks. Very important if you want high marks from me. The food was all delicious. Some dishes really knocked it out of the park, others were just good. We shared a few things: Burrata - everything you hope Burrata will be - creamy, milky, slightly sweet buttery flavor paired nicely with pistachios and apricot or date compote. YUM Fried ribs - good, but they should ease up on the sauce. It overpowered the actual meat flavor. Next time I'm going to ask for the sauce on the side. Mussels - OH man! That curry sauce should be bottled and sold. I would pore it over anything and everything. The bartender was nice enough to bring us extra bread so we could mop up the sauce. Oh and the mussels were cooked perfectly. Veggie Paella - This dish took a little longer but perfection takes time. I will be going back for this dish on the regular. Most Paella is over powered by them putting too much saffron but this was perfect and you don't miss seafood or meat at all. I can't wait to go back and try more! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Delicious truffles (they're truffles, after all), but the artistry does not nearly compare to that at Gail Ambrosius or the lamentably closed Cocoliquot. The chocolates look like they're made on a cruddy assembly line machine, two halves stuck together around a filling, with dimples in the bottoms sometimes. Most the flavors taste pretty similar to me with just slight variations, but they are very good and should be savored one at a time. Definitely better for your chocolate fix than anything you'll get at the grocery store. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I'm still conflicted about this place although I'm leaning towards digging it. My friend had a party last wknd there and booked out the back room (which you would never know it was there with it's sneaky bookshelf door) We had dinner there pretty early and at 630pm they were already out of a few items so that sucked. But the food that we did have? Amazeballs. They describe their food as contemporary tapas and that's exactly what it was-we noshed on pretty much everything they had-chicken lollipops, deviled eggs, filet, scallops, salad and shrimp cocktail. The filet and chicken were my far my fave-both flavorful and succulent. Service was on point the entire night, never slow with a pour and there if we needed her. I tried to stay in the back room for most of the night because anytime I walked out into the main area it seemed as if I just entered d-bag city. So I would try to get through there as quickly as possible then hang out on the patio in front which gets cozy quickly. The music didn't really match the vibe -Blackstreets No Diggity just doesn't fit the bill where as their jazzy renditions of current hits before 9pm suited the place just fine. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I have always been a fan of the MGM-Mirage properties having stayed at both the Mirage and Treasure Island (TI) on previous trips. I have to say that the MGM Grand rates much lower in comparison. Being an MGM-Mirage Players Club member, I was offered a promotional rate via email: $59.99 (Monday - Thursday) and $79.99 (Friday). This was much such a good deal that I couldn't pass it up, in the past I usually booked through either Expedia, Orbitz, or Travelocity. I have one of the MGM-Mirage credit cards which offers certain perks such as earning Gift Certificates, Invited Guest Check-In, and Early/Late Check-Out. During this visit I was able to use the Invited Guest Check-In, which you think would be more efficient since this is the line that people with Casino Hosts use. I was only the third person in line, and it took longer than if I would've waited in the normal check-in lines 5 or 6 people deep. The room was nothing too special, it had a view of the parking garage and Koval Lane. The TV was outdated (TI had upgraded to LCD TVs in 2006). The best part of the room was the bed, which was surprisingly comfortable. I'm not sure if it was isolated to our room but there was an adjoining door to the room next to us that seemed as if it was paper thin, we could hear normal conversations being carried out late at night and early in the morning. The pool is a mystery to find. I am thinking that the pool was more accessible in the past before the hotel did renovations in connecting the MGM Grand to the MGM Signature Towers. From the elevator, you need to walk through some shopping areas down a long corridor to the pool. I almost think that the casino is too big at the MGM Grand. If you want to visit any of the other casinos in the area: NY NY or Excalibur it is a very long walk from the elevators to the walkways of these casinos. Also, some of the slots are very dated, especially the quarter slots. We had a slot machine malfunction twice in about a 30 minute time frame. Also, with the casino being so big, the cocktail waitresses are nowhere to be found in the slots areas. I would wait for a room renovation before staying here again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Ahhh, welcome back into the good graces of this Yelper. Without the pesky issues of a distracted waiter and high dinner prices, my craving for this version of chicken parmesan, turned out a success.

The pasta salad was still tasty and despite me trying to save half the sandwich for later, it is pretty impossible to have that sort of will power when it comes to the Chicken parm takeout at Brioni's.

Fitness is important to us and I can think of a lot of people who would spend what it costs for a month's membership and then some on a night out in Las Vegas. Can't put a price on health!

 Mediocre pizza. The crust is thin, but not crispy or tasty at all. The sauce is overly sweet. The cheese tastes like government surplus cheese used in school cafeterias. The pepperoni is bland and tasteless. Overall very average, maybe even below average pizza. Maybe the calzones are better. Phoenix, this is what you call good pizza? The 3-star rating is being nice.

 Not impressed. I ate here with my coworkers and we all ordered a variety of dishes. I'll go over the issues with the restaurant first: the broccolini was overly oiled and very soggy. The pizza was $25 and was a personal pan that tasted no better than the cheap pizza place down the hall. We ordered the scallops and they came out RAW! I would not recommend this place. Too pricy for the low quality of food. ",0,1,0,0,0

 It starts losing it's appeal when you venture out of the strip a little more when you wanna club in Vegas. You should go here once. JUST ONCE, after that never come here gain. Yes, there's nekkid girls in tubs. Yes, there's all these extravagant decorations and Asian statues. Yes, there's multiple rooms. But you know what? THE DANCE FLOOR SUCKS. WTF were they thinking. I swear, they just stuffed the place with tons of tables for VIP bottle service that for those who don't wanna dish several bills for alcohol, it's kinda just a waste of time. I can BARELY dance on that little piece of square they call the dance floor. WHAT'S THE POINT ANYMORE?! Just to stand around and spend hella money on drinks? I COULD DO THAT AT A BAR. LAME. LAME. LAME. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place serves dim sum (like their name states) but that doesn't mean they offer good dim sum. I think this place stays busy because of the lack of competition in the area for dim sum. I've had better, much better for the same price in a variety of places around the nation. I think their dinner service is slightly better than the dim sum. If you want authentic Chinese food, you can pretty much order whatever you like here. The food is pretty average but if you have a craving for something special and unique (like your mom or grandmother made for you), you could give it a shot here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Only ever eaten in the bar during happy hour, so this review is not for old school steak house fare with all the fixins. That's cool though because I can't bring myself to eat a ginormous hunk o' muscle very often anyway. I can go years without ending up in a steakhouse and when I do it's generally a meh experience regardless of how orgasmic people tell me the slice of cow is supposed to be. Saloon 1889 on the other hand is right up my alley. Hey, we all have our vices. The atmosphere is pure Arizona. It's the perfect combination between the slightly nauseating Rawhide's folksy old-Zona and the Rat Pack old school Arizona exemplified by Durant's, with maybe a dash of Monti's La Casa Mediocre tossed in for good measure. The bar is a massive antique-looking dark wood relic from another era, with ornate pillars and a huge gilded mirror along one side. The bartenders also look like they could whip you up a classic cocktail, the stuff with bitters, or a girly sugar bomb. They got skills. The happy hour is really where's it's at here. Free sliders, chips and salsa. Couple bucks off the bar bites, which are substantial meal replacements. Cheap wine, well, beer, all delivered with a smile. ",0,0,0,1,0

 While I enjoyed the restaurant and the service, when I compare the food to my high BBQ standards, I can't give it more than 3 stars...maybe 3.5 for the happy hour prices. I ordered the sliders so that I could try more than one kind of meat. I opted for the brisket, pork and chicken. They all tasted like they were precooked and kept moist in steamers or steamed after smoking to help with the shredding process. . They all had a slightly watery flavor. The house sauce provided at the table was just ok. I requested sides of their spicy sauce, and their mustard sauce. Individually I have to say I really was impressed by the mustard sauce. The spicy was too hot for my tastes. When I mixed a little of the house sauce, with the mustard sauce and a touch of the spicy sauce, I had something I was really enjoying to make the sliders pop. The house coleslaw is good and the side was enough for at least 2 to share. On my way out I ordered some peach cobbler to go. Quality! I enjoyed the topping. Left over cobbler tasted just as good in the morning for breakfast. ",0,0,1,0,0

 finally got to try out this place last weekend! very good ramen, the noodles are not as thin as monta but still has a good bite, which is good coz there's nothing worse than soggy noodles in your ramen bowl. tried the spicy shio ramen and the broth and the noodles were perfect. the shio broth was not as salty like the usual shoyu broth. the meat slices are also thicker and not like those circular meat slices with a lot of fat. i was just hoping it would be a lot spicier though. the staff was also very friendly and i guess since it's fairly new, there was no wait to get a table. overall, i like it better than monta. :) ",0,0,0,0,1

 After countless stories about how great chef jose andres is i assumed this place would be absolutely amazing. Therefore, i set my bar preeeetty high for this place and expected greatness. What i got was decent mexican AND chinese food. many of the reviews were right, its not some type of amazing fusion blend of the 2 but more so of the 2 cuisines in one restaurant. The tongue(lengua) tacos were very delicious, but after having some authentic tacos from the ghetto side of vegas, it made these ones look like a joke as there was no special kick to it. We also tried the dan dan noodles which were pretty unique out of all the dishes we ordered, but for some reason didnt hit the spot. I couldn't taste too much of the unique flavors as it was just plain spicy. Overall, its not a horrible place, but nothing spectacular to earn a 4-5 stars in my book. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Service is great the server was very friendly. However the food is not up to par as other Cheesecake Factory locations that I have tried. I was disappointed in the quality of food. They get 3 stars one for the server, one for the hostess and one for the backup singers who sang happy birthday to my mom. Great personalities but that cannot justify coming back here to eat. Great food makes me want to come back and my taste buds need to be tantalized in order for me to give a 4 star and up rating. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I dont know. This Star Nursery feels much bigger than the one that I usually go to....and it has a cute little turtle pond...... But, I don't know.. something just felt lacking. Of course, there's always the guys who want jobs. I've never had a problem with them at other stores. But today was different. Being eye raped and talked about while I'm trying to put my daughter in her stroller does not make me want to buy cacti, or flowers, or vegetables. It makes me want to get back in my car and leave. Besides that. No one talked to us. No one smiled. Even when I went up to the ""information desk"" it was lacking. I asked about HollyHock, which grows really well out here. I asked if they sold plants or seeds. There was no clear answer. I was told that I could check the seeds, which were ""over there, inside."" The woman went on about how her HollyHock needed to be started. And that it's so easy to start. Uh, well, then hook it up. Don't make me jealous that you have HollyHock and I dont. I went ""over there, inside"" and did not find what I was looking for. They did have quite a few items on sale, but customer service and information is lacking. The turtles are cute and all, but I'd rather go to the one by my house with stray cats and be greeted with a smile. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My hubby and I got swedish massages here. I got mine for $99, since there was a summer special for Vdara hotel guests. Not too bad for a brand new, Vegas spa massage for 50 minutes. You can use the facilities up to 8pm the day of your service, so feel free to come back whenever you like. They have your basic amenities like everything you need for a shower, freshening up (hair brushes, hair spray, lotions, etc.), snacks, refreshments, sauna, jacuzzi, and steam room. I've been to Qua and this place is a bit smaller, but more ""up to date"". The only thing that this spa has that Qua doesn't is the Meditation Lounge. This is where you can take a nap after your services. It literally has several beds with blankets on them. Nice to lay down after a relaxing massage, and listen to water flowing. =) The price of a day here for guests is $25, and $50 for those not staying at the hotel. It's a lot less crowded here than other spas I've been to, but I think it's because of the price. Nice for me, since there were at most 3 people in at a time. Definitely worth $99 for a facial and massage. Next time I'm gonna get a deep tissue massage... ",0,0,0,1,0

 I'll begin with the positives. Executive is cheap - only $6 to/from the strip. Their shuttle buses are clean and well air-conditioned. Our driver from the airport was very friendly, and got everyone to their respective hotels very quickly and safely. That's where the positives end. I wish our trip from our hotel back to the airport was as pleasant as the first. Alas, it was not. Our driver arrived on time (about the only positive), but once we were on our way, I thought we might not make it to the airport! He weaved in and out of traffic recklessly, jostling the 5 passengers in the bus worse than a wooden rollercoaster! He nearly clipped a stopped car as we entered the drive for another hotel so he could see if anyone was at the stop (they weren't - he sped away, over speed bumps and all!). When we finally arrived at the airport, he got our luggage out from the back. Two other passengers got their bags and were on their way. I was the first of our party of three to get my bag. I thanked the driver and began walking away. As the second person in our party got his bags, the driver began saying very rude things and even called us names!! I was appalled! The third and final member of our group retrieved his bags after this nonsense, and I can tell you the driver did NOT receive a tip as he so bluntly was looking for one. Try not to insult your customers before they're off the bus. So, certainly, go with Executive if you A.) have a hankering to be insulted by the man providing the service for which you have paid, or B.) have your wallet out and ready, waving dollar bills in the driver's face so that he will not treat you thus.

 This is a true 3.5 considering it is in Vegas. If it was not a Vegas hotel it would be a solid 5 stars but given the newer hotels that have gone up in Vegas, the competition is stiff. Caesars is an older spot that lacks some of the decor and nightlife that the other spots have to offer. Caesars caters to an older crowd nowadays, which I can understand because for those who were frequenting vegas 15 years ago, CP was the place to stay. But don't worry, for the young folk there is plenty to do. Caesars is a great place to stay if you get an upgraded room. The standard rooms are just any standard hotel room but the upgraded rooms are nice and comfy with a spacious bathroom, vanity, and jacuzzi. Comfy, clean, and spacious. Wi-Fi is not included. The lago buffet has been replaced by bachannal, which is supposedly one of the best buffets in vegas right now. Although my favorite places to stay in vegas are the palazzo and the wynn/encore, Caesars is a great place to stay if you dont mind being away from the hot night life spots. There are the forum shops (which I LOVE), many lounges, great restaurant options, and of course the best spa in vegas QUA (45$ day pass). They also have a nice pool which is heated to 86 degrees in the winter. The casino is not my favorite but it has every slot/table you would expect. They have a Pussycat lounge blackjack table area with live girls dancing. It is an awkward setting but definitely entertaining. The nightlife here is definitely not trendy or the hot place to be right now. They have many lounges and their big club is Pure, which has definitely fallen off. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have to say I decided to wait overnight before I left this review. Below is how I came to my star review... *****5 stars for the pizza!! This was our first visit, after reading reviews we decided to give it a try. Buddyz is right down the street and we drive by often headed to eat at The Deli. We walked in and thought we found our new ""go to"" place. Nice selection of wine and craft beer. Good menu selection, we were excited to see salads and sandwiches as well as the pizza. We ordered the Butter Crust pizza and it was excellent!! No complaints whatsoever! *1 star for the service!! As stated in many other posts, the service is definitely lacking. The man I believe to be the owner greets most everyone at the door and says hello which we thought was a good sign. As we were determining our drink order my husband was asking the waitress if any of the beers on their board were Porters. She said she really didn't know and just started reading the names off the board...we already did that. She bumbled around for a bit and then said she would go get her boss (the guy I'm assuming is the owner). He did come over and described a beer to my husband and he ordered it, turned out to be a good recommendation. Next up, food order. We ordered the a Butter Crust pizza then my husband asked the waitress to recommend a sandwich. She did do that without much hesitation and my husband asked to add lettuce, tomato and mayo. She said, I don't think we can do that...really, you can't add lettuce, tomato and mayo to a sandwich? She offered to go in the back and ask, went in the back and came back out and said nope, we can't do it, my boss is really strict in the kitchen!?!?!? Needless to say my husband didn't order the sandwich and highly considered just leaving. Had the ""boss"" ever come back around to ask how the beer recommendation was or how the pizza was I surely would have asked him about his strict kitchen policy. Owners - read your reviews!! I don't know how many businesses have gone in and out of this location. The food is great, but giving paying customers what they want is even better!! You want people to return, if they liked the food, fix the rest! We really did like the food but debate whether we would return due to the service, we would certainly hesitate recommending it to friends. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've never paid more than $7 for a bowl of Pho. For $12 bucks, I expected something out of the ordinary! But of course, there was nothing special to this expensive bowl of Pho. I guess everything really is overpriced in Vegas. Being the lazy people that we are, we didn't want to walk far for food in the sweltering weather. Treasure Island was the closest hotel to Trump, so we kinda just settled for this place. The Pho wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. I tried some of my friends' Chicken Curry as well. It was really bland and the sauce needed to be thicker. Our bill came out to be almost $80 for just 6 people. Don't think I will ever be returning here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I stayed at the Americas Best Value Inn for CES 2013. Here's the listing of problems I had starting at Day 01. My room had no hot water, at best between warm and cold. The heater wasn't giving off any heat and there phone wasn't working. The front desk did get the maintenance to come right away which was a good sign but the problem never got solved. I thought it was just my room next to me reported the same problem about the water. At the end of walking through CES I was hoping to relax in the jacuzzi but sure enough, ice cold. Day 02. After complain a third time I asked for another room and again the front desk helped out and put me three building back. Everything worked in this room except the Internet having to weak of a signal which I needed for CES. Thank goodness I had a smart phone, so that to me is just a nitpick. Day03. As I was taking my last shower before I check out the whole water line just shuts off. Thank God the heater worked or I'd be freezing while calling the problem to the front desk. This is all the reports of problems I had. My opinion. I ended up having one of the worst times at a motel. The front desk is great and the maintenance get to you very quickly and that's why it even got two stars. So if you don't want to chance it like I did, go send the extra money. I fortunately got this room at bottom rate during the summer of 2012 but if I had to pay the active rate I would have probably gone off. That's my reports and opinions. I hope this helps others.

 ""Mediterranean"" market with a halal butcher counter and a small dine-in area offering up falafel, kabob, and shwarma plates and sandwiches. Store itself isn't much: the other Euro markets have better selection and organization, and the only thing making this ""Mediterranean"" is their selection of baklava, olives, and olive oil. But all of their products can be found elsewhere in town, and their produce is less than fresh. But the halal butcher is fairly unique: $27 for a giant lamb shank to be turned into a stew? Totally doable here. Dine-in counter has a few basic tables and chairs but most orders seem to be for takeout. As advertised on a banner on building exterior, they have a chicken shwarma sandwich for $4.99. What the banner doesn't tell you is that it's a giant wrap with an amazing garlic sauce. That garlic sauce makes it, and it's what I miss from my favorite Med place in Texas. I'll come back for that, repeatedly! Another score on the menu is the beef filet mignon kabobs: priced at a $12 plate for a good portion of tender, flavorful beef on a bed of yellow rice, with sides of marinated veggies and creamy hummus. Hummus was good, and is on the sides menu for about $5/portion along with babaghanoush and tabouli. Come for the chicken shwarma wrap and the filet, but not much else. Do your grocery shopping elsewhere, grab your dinner to go. Counter service doesn't really speak English, so just know the number of the meal you're ordering. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I love the penthouse suites at the plaza hotel. They are located on the 20th something floor of the south tower. The hotel itself can use some work, but the penthouse is nice. It is not what you would consider a typical penthouse being as there is no separate bedroom, but still some of the nicest rooms in the Plaza by far. When you walk in there is an armoir with a tv in front of you, to the left is the bed, two the right there is a huge dresser. Just beyond the bed are to sofas and a coffee table. on the way to the bathroom there is a wet bar, high table with high bar chairs. once in the bathroom there is a jacuzzie to your right and a separate shower. Directly in front of you is a door that seems it might be to a closet, but actually it is where the toilet is. The toilet is in a separe area, nice. So I haven't actually stayed at the plaza, but I did check out the room because I was looking for an inexpensive, but nice room for valentine's day. I think if you must stay at the plaza, spend the extra money for the penthouse upgrade. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Quick, call Guy Fieri! You've lost your mojo! Had lunch there this noon. Jerk chicken, egg foo young, chicken fried rice and refried beans. The chicken was tasteless (I've been to Jamaica, so I know what it tastes like), and the egg foo young was warmed over with package gravy. The fried rice was bland and the refried beans came from those big cans a Costco. The portions used to be pretty good sized, but they've cut back on that too. That and a drink was $10, way more than it should have cost. Big, no, HUGE disappointment from the past. Bottom line: bland, small portions, over priced.

 If I had reviewed this place after only eating their food a few times, I would probably have given them 5 stars.. I've ordered delivery from them about 8 times total between the middle of march and now. The first 4 times we had food from them they were excellent! The food was delicious the delivery didn't take very long, the delivery guy was great. Overall, those first 4 experiences were awesome. Since then their service has gone downhill consistently. The last time that we ordered from them our order was entirely screwed up and we had waited 1hr & 50 mins for chile relleno, 2 tacos, 2 horchatas, and a taco salad. All of our food was cold and we only got 1 horchata because the delivery driver dropped the other one. Their tacos are usually great but these were just bad. Anyway, I'm not sure what's been going on at Moreno's in Tempe, but everytime we've ordered from them it's gotten worse. I hope this is temporary because when we first had their food, I loved it.

 Prime; one of the top four steak houses in Vegas. A pantheon of beef. Where Bacchus reigns over a 500+ selection of to die for wines. Where the ""brown"" libations are over the top. At Prime, the menu is seasonally updated. The fall of 2012 features an outstanding, air flown colossal stone crab appetizer (three huge claws the size of your hand with a pile of knuckle and leg meat). Heaven and at $75, and worth every penny. Sweet. Perfect. The steak tartar on a platter of Carpaccio is delicious but slightly unbalanced with over the top Asian spice heat. Finally, the bacon wrapped shrimp. Wow. The fat of the bacon permeates the rich, sweet flesh of the barely cooked through shrimp. Outstanding. Beef mains are to die for. Japanese A5 Kobe cuts of beef (4oz minimum $35 per ounce). Sublime if you don't over indulge. A four to six ounce portion is enough for anyone. Offered in a strip, rib, or fillet cut. The rib is the most flavorful. DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU WANT YOUR BEEF COOKED BEYOND RARE. You are wasting your money as the fat will melt during cooking and the beef taste like any other piece of beef. The 30 day dry aged, bone fillet is excellent. Huge umame finish without tasting edgy. Soft and tender. The veal chop is equally good. Sweet, deep beef flavor from free ranged calves. Double cut, perfectly seared and moist throughout. All mains come with sauces and sides. They match and are very flavorful but do not pass on ordering some veg and off the menu potato dauphinois to share. Sides are perfectly cooked. Rich and refreshing. Killer wine list with great depth of cult wines. Great values to be found at higher price points (best priced Screaming Eagle in Vegas). Outstanding cognac selection. Service is excellent. Friendly and extremely efficient. Note: Unlike most Vegas restaurants, for reservations, you MUST be a high status member of Mlife to book the best tables and times on short notice. If you use OpenTable, make your reservation at least 60 days in advance Outdoor and window tables where you can view the incredible fountain show at the Bellagio are very difficult to secure. A truly memorable experience in Vegas not afforded to everyone. Do whatever it takes to try it. A dozen plus visits since my initial review. Extremely consistent. Highly Recommended. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Please - let me list some disclosures. 1. This is not your typical frilly or relaxing place. 2. This is down and gritty Chinese massaging. 3. They have open rooms with a curtain. ( you can hear other massages taking place, which could be kind of or very awkward) 4. None of them speak English well, or none at all. I was not sure what to expect when coming, and I can definitely tell you...I was nervous. This is a place that you come to with male and female masseuses. They set you up in a small room with a bed that sits about 1-2 feet off the ground and they only give you a somewhat large towel to cover up. If you're more conservative, this is probably not the place for you. I've been sick and I always need a good deep tissue massage to help me recover faster. This did the trick. It may not be pretty, but this dude dug into my back and shoulders enough to get those nasty knots out. Most people don't even focus on your knots. Also, this place is clean and they do provide good service. They're prices are super cheap and very reasonable. If you're looking to get the kinks out and just get a good ol' fashioned massage...come to this little nook of a place. ",0,0,0,1,0

Am besten man kommt nicht zu fr \ u00fch (ab 19:00 Uhr), dann ist das Band voll. F \ u00fcr mich das beste Sushi in Karlsruhe (und ich habe meiner Ansicht nach alle durch). Preise: G \ u00fcnstiger kann man keine Sushi essen Einrichtung: Asiatisch n \ u00fcchtern, ein bischen mehr Ambiente w \ u00e4re toll. Daf \ u00fcr viel Platz. Zum Thema Terasse: Das hat mein Vorschreiber absolut recht. die Tisch geh \ u00f6ren auf den M \ u00fcll, da kann kein vern \ u00fcnftiger Mensch dran sitzen. Da wir aber sowieso nur am Band sitzen . Tipp: Telefonisch reservieren, damit man einen von den 6 Tischen am Band bekommt. Hier kann man man mit 4 oder 6 Personen gut sitzen. Weiter so, wir kommen immer wieder gerne! ",0,0,0,0,1

 They were quite helpful when we went in. I had to special-order an item. I later found it at Lowe's in stock and $11 cheaper. I called Ace to cancel my special order. The girl asked if I could calk back in the morning! No, I work, I am calling now. ? Good service except that. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Updating my review: Still love this place! They are open on Mondays now. The menu has expanded and the prices have slightly increased since they opened, maybe an extra 50 cents. Not a big deal, prices are still very reasonable. The pho broth here is my favorite. It has a great flavor and doesn't taste overwhelmingly salty. ",0,0,0,0,1

 So lucky to have them in my neighborhood...great service, incredibly kind, caring and knowledgeable staff - every single one of them. My dogs love coming here. I do too. Their alkaline water subscription is the best kept secret/best deal in town. 100% guarantee on all their products - will accept returns if pets don't like the food/product. I can't say enough nice things about everyone who works here. I have three vizslas and they're a handful...and have broken things at the store because they get so excited when they're there -- and they still are kind and welcoming to me. I also have a dog with severe allergies and they've helped me every step along the way including helping me get the holistic assistance for him I desperately needed. If you have a pet, having this sort of a resource at your disposal is invaluable. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We stayed at this hotel last may for three nights. My boyfriend and I went to Vegas as a small vacation after the exams, and our main concern was not to spend too much. The price was very fair, we paid something in the neighborhood of 60 dollars per night. The room was clean (trust me, I am a germophobic) over any expectations, given the cheap price. THe down side would be that it is NOT on the strip, and although it might seem pretty close, it is not. it's like a 20 minute walk to the startosphere, and even then you are just on the crappy end of the strip. But aside from that, it a pleasant experience. We visited the pool. It was pretty clean and there were plenty of towels and chairs, however they didn't have umbrellas, which are necessary in the deserts. I would go there again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 made reservation through opentable.com after not being able to decide on where to go and so we try it out.. the only thing that I think is modern french in this restaurant is their decor and how they name the dishes because food was okay, service was okay, a bit slow, and dessert was to me is the highlight of my meal.. tried out the escargot as appetizer, I think that it's a bit too chewy, but the sauce was right on spot so I ended up using the sauce to dip my bread on.. we had a steak and lamb chop for entree and that sure took a while without the server ever coming to our table to inform that our food took longer than usual maybe.. overall, a bit overpriced for a decent food, so it was okay, will I come back??

 This review is based on this Lee's vs. All the others and against other liquor stores in town. Obviously, since it's Lee's the prices are great and there is a good variety, but that's all i'm giving it credit for. I have read others claiming this is an ""express store."" This may be true...But it's not advertised as such, and therefore I went expecting a standard Lee's experience. I have gone back several times but they are consistently out of my staples. There is usually at least one knowledgeable person at each location but the employees here, while very polite, are never short on blank stares when I ask about anything, which is inevitably followed by a scavenger hunt. Basically...get a new sign that says Lee's Discount Express, and I'll bump it up to 3 stars. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I made a bad mistake today, I let the wife decide where we were going for dinner. She picked a Brazilian Steakhouse. Now I actually like the concept, lots of meats, cooked well, full of flavor...And way over priced.... I love meat, beef, pork, chicken, hell give me deep fried budgie (google it Americans) in garlic and I would be happy. So I am left conflicted, lots of good meat...for a price that's lets face it folks, in Vegas you can get a very good steak for, i'm sorry, but when these restaurants started showing up in Vegas dinner was $25 -$30, now they are $50 and up...Seriously, look long and hard at what you are getting, they just don't make sense...But I let the wife pick dinner... So, after a quick ""no"", ""But you said I could pick"" conversation she headed of to groupon, where she came across a deal for this place....Plus she had a credit with groupon that covered the cost... Ok meat plus a meal I had already payed for..Works for me. Service was good, seated quickly, waiter friendly, diet coke delivered quickly, though the refill took time to come... But it's the food you want to know about....Well frankly, the meal was ""free""...And I think we were charged to much. The meats were dry, the fish were cooked to death, the shrimp tasteless. The one saving grace was desert (yes we went to an all you can eat meat place and still wanted dessert, that should tell you something)...I had the tiramisu, the wife had the cheesecake, they were both very good. In the end there are far better Brazilian steak houses in town. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Booked our limo weeks in advance directly on the Omni website, received an email confirmation, but when we arrived at the airport there was no driver waiting for us. When we called their office we were told there was no record of our confirmation and that the driver would be ""5 or 10 minutes"" picking us up. No apologies or explanations. After 30 minutes of waiting outside, the driver finally arrived. He was fairly pleasant, but charged us $20 more than the price that was quoted on the confirmation. Won't be using Omni again in the future. ",1,0,0,0,0

 2nd AMENDMENT BABY!!! Remember your right to bear arms!!! With that said... Because of the mayhem, the walls of their store was bare. Hardly any firearms were available for sale. The friendly staff did mention that their stock would slowly come back to life. Only time will tell. Gas is going down, however firearms and ammo is going up. STOP THE MADNESS!!! We strolled into their gun range to test out my new sub compact. We also rented one of their pistols that we were interested in. Renting one of their pistols before purchasing is a great way to pick which firearm is right for you. $10 a pistol. Not a bad deal. Range ammo was very reasonable. $20 for a box of 50 rounds in .40 S&W. Not bad. We purchased range time at $15 a person and some target silhouettes. I really like their range. One of my favorite ranges when I'm not shooting up the desert. Very simple. You can move your targets from 3 to I think 20 yards. I kept mine at 7ish. We saw two range masters working the range. Very friendly and not shadowing you. I loved hearing the fully autos popping off from a couple of stalls away. A good crowd of law-abiding citizens shooting for fun and relieving stress. Our rounds eventually deplenish and our silhouettes are now looking like swiss cheese. I'm very happy with my new sub compact. EYE LIKA!!! Not too sure about the rental. They do offer a Carrying a Concealed Weapons license (CCW) class. Grant is the range master who instructs the class. Very knowledgeable with Nevada gun laws. Also American Shooters offer the Utah CCW license if you need to carry in our neighbor's hood. Great deals on renting pistols. Their fully autos is a different story. CCW class is offered for knowledge in gun etiquette and safety. American Shooters...EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!! ",0,0,0,1,0

 The wife and I received an Entertainment book and have been using that, along with Yelp, to find new places to try. One night we randomly opened to the page featuring an El Rancho BOGO coupon. It's right down the road from the house, so why not? We walked in, saw there was only one other table and were greeted and seated before the door closed behind us. Our drink order was taken and filled quickly too. After the chips and canned salsa came out, we placed our order and waited patiently for our food. The other table was getting ready to leave about the time we were running out of drinks and chips. No problem, once the one front of house employee is done cashing them out, he will come refill our glasses. Or, maybe he would just ignore us. Our drinks sat empty, the chips were long gone and only a partially full dish of flavorless, straight from the can salsa kept us company. Sitting within line of sight (and about 5 feet) from the drink machine, I was tempted to just refill our glasses myself. About that time, the server guy decided to stop by and refill our water. Shortly thereafter, our food came out. I gave the tacos and enchilada plate a try. I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was a hidden cheese enchilada hidden in the sauce next to my chicken enchilada. The taco was tasty, nothing magical, but it wasn't as bad as others that I have had. The enchiladas were also not bad, but nothing too amazing. The sauce seemed to also have come from a can, it didn't have any individuality. The restaurant used to be an American restaurant/cafe with an ice cream bar that made waffle cones fresh. There is still a strong smell of waffle cones in the air, which makes for a weird combination with Mexican-style dishes. Also, it would seem that they are trying to save money on electricity by not having a strong A/C presence and keeping the air moving with box fans, industrial strength wire frame fans and the like. A boom box sitting on the counter plays Mariachi music too loudly throughout the dining area too. Having only one table can lead to servers either spending too much time checking on the customers or completely ignoring them. While the gentleman was very nice when he interacted with us, he was a little too absent while our drinks were empty. He was not even in view, so we could flag him down either. If we're in a pinch, don't want to travel far and I am craving tacos, we may hit El Rancho up again, it won't be a go-to place though. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Waterslide Hyperdrive By The Rue Sunday I took my boys to Sunsplash, It was a party I had to crash, After five hours we were gone in a flash, None of us developed a rash. Been a while since I went down the slides, Kids had fun going down on their hides, The wave pool doesn't have tides, Entertainment this place provides. Checked out moms in their bikini, Did funny things to my weenie, I didn't wear a hat or a beanie, Rub the side of a lamp, get a genie. $50 bucks for the season pass, I mostly chilled in the grass, My kids are awesome and never sass, I like to fish for trout and bass. While the kids played I read a book, Every 2 minutes gave those moms a look, They probably thought I was a crook, There was nothing of value that I could've took. We'll probably go again this Sunday, Instead of sitting at home they'll get to play, 5 really fun rides that aren't painted grey, Going down the halfpipe, you better pray. Rubber Ducky ",0,0,0,1,0

 Where to begin!! Everything about this place is beautiful! We had room 5823 (facing the strip and in the middle) and oh my!!! The view was just amazing!! A Panoramic view room is the way to go! The staff is super friendly, the rooms are clean and don't smell like smoke, the pool is large, the grounds and inside the building are all sooo pretty! Try to come here during the week as it is obviously cheaper and less people. Definitely a 5 star hotel and I wouldn't think twice about staying here again but will probably try the Encore next time.

 This was my first time to this shop. I pride myself being somewhat of a sandwich connoisseur so I was excited to try this place out. I enjoyed being able to write what I would like on the sandwich bag. I was a little disappointed that the gyro was unavailable. We put in our order and waited. While we were waiting the staff proceeded to talk with their friends who were just hanging out in the store. The friends were in the food area when he was making our food and running around chasing one of the girls who worked there. We ended up waiting around 15-20 minutes for our sandwiches and we were the only customers in the store. It just seems like a poorly managed establishment. I felt really uncomfortable being in there. The food was ok. Nothing compared to Capriottis. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Very similar to the Hard Rock Cafe in terms of atmosphere and types of food served but without the Hard Rock prices and better food. Plus, like Hard Rock, you can buy t-shirts and souvenirs. A group of co-workers and I decided to go there for lunch since four of the five of us hadn't been there before. It seemed like quite a popular lunch destination as almost the entire inside was full. We were seated promptly and had a very nice server. The menu includes your standard sports bar appetizers, wings, salads, and sandwiches. There is even a small ""low carb"" section, with some very tasty sounding wraps. I ordered the BLT and my bacon came out pretty crispy for the most part, as I requested. I liked how the bread wasn't toasted, but grilled, and my crispy fries were delicious. I appreciated how the sandwich size was reasonable (you know, so it actually fit in my mouth) and I received a nice side of fries, but not too many. Portions appeared to be very reasonable. With the sandwiches and burgers, you get a choice of two sides, but I only got the fries. Smart move on my part, as two sides would have been too much food for me. My one co-worker ordered off the kids menu and our waitress was totally fine with that. For the five of us, our bill came to $52, which is very very reasonable. I can see how this is a popular destination before Diamondback or Suns games...plenty of TVs dot the restaurant so regardless of where you are sitting, you have an easy view of at least one TV. Service was quick despite a pretty full restaurant (we were in and out in well under an hour). Street parking was a tad tricky as most of the meters this afternoon were unavailable to park at (not sure why). But if you are going before a game, parking won't be an issue. The heavy eyeliner on the servers and hostesses was a bit much for me, but fits in the overall theme of the restaurant I suppose. All and all a good choice if you work downtown and are looking for a lunch place or before a sporting event. Not sure I would make a special trip to eat here though. UPDATE (4/20/08): I have been to Coopers Town a few times since my initial review, most recently today before a Diamondbacks home game. Based on my subsequent experiences after my initial review, I have bumped up my star rating to 4 stars. I have tried a few more things on the menu and I highly recommend the crispy chicken wrap...it is delicious! The atmosphere at Coopers Town before a game is awesome and is a great spot to hit before a game. Plus how can you go wrong with $3 Bud, Bud Light, and Amber Bock drafts on home game days for the Suns and Diamondbacks? ",0,0,0,1,0

 This review is long overdue. Partially because I keep telling myself that I'm going to write a review after the next time I go to Khyber Halal. So, after our 4th dining experience there, here I go! The first time we tried to go to Khyber Halal, we were able to go inside the restaurant but they told us they weren't doing dinner service because they were catering a banquet dinner off site. No problem, we made arrangements to go back a few weeks later. Our next visit was during Ramadan. We didn't know that until we arrived to see a big sign on the door saying that they were observing the month long holiday. Not to be deterred, we came back a few weeks later and were seated by a friendly, young man (presumably, the owner's son?) and we waited. and waited. Finally, about 10 minutes later, I was able to call someone over to take our order and get waters for the table. We ordered the chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, mantoo, samosas and brown rice. The samosas were a bit dry and the chutney that was served with them was nice but in styrofoam containers. I have absolutely nothing but positive things to say about the rest of the meal. Fantastic, flavorful and probably impossible to beat for the prices at this restaurant. Our waters weren't refilled throughout our meal but we almost didn't notice because the food was so good. We didn't need to order extra naan as they make sure you get enough bread to feed an army. With an appetizer, a few sides and three entrees, our meal was less than $40. Our next 3 visits were a bit more of the same. Lackluster service, outstanding food. It's why we keep going back. I keep saying I wish someone would nominate Khyber Halal for a Restaurant Impossible or Kitchen Nightmares type show. They need a visual makeover and the sons could take a lesson in service. Again, they are super friendly but have probably never worked in a restaurant before. This place would be a 5 if they could get their skills up to par a bit. Don't let the service keep you away. If this place was around the corner from me, I'd be here a few times a week for lunch. See you soon Khyber! ",0,0,0,1,0

 An upscale mexican restaurant in the area seemed like the best thing to have happened to me. I planned my visit for a quieter evening, and reviewed the menu again and again. However, upon our arrival I thought twice immediately. The parking was iffy, and the place didn't seem to stand up to the signage. Perhaps the art was not to my liking, honestly not a piece stands out in my memory. We were seated immediately. Our waiter seemed a little off, not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen, where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is). Halfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes, easily), the lamp above our table went out. We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed. Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls. When the food finally arrived, we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left. Unfortunately, we took our grub with us. I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce. It's no coincidence you're taken aback by the combination... it didn't go down too easily. Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal, though, we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand. Normally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right, but since I am recommending that you not go there, why bother? ",1,0,0,0,0

 The Mrs. and I had never been here yet. Her boss was in town and we needed a place to take her for dinner before she caught her flight home. Now normally, we don't like to take someone somewhere we haven't been, but her boss had heard about St. Francis and wanted to go. Here's another, ""I really wanted to like this place, but..."" review. I thought the food was good. Very tasty and decent portion sizes. However, for what you get, I thought it was a bit overpriced. We enjoyed our dinner at a quiet table upstairs, but since her flight wasn't until almost midnight, we decided to hang out for awhile and enjoy a few beverages and catch up. Everything was great until they decided to close the upstairs around 10 PM and they sent our waitress home form the evening. The waiter who took our order was a little snooty and appeared to have other places he'd rather be. Drink refills were few and far between and we thought they were trying to close up. I excused myself to use the men's room and when I went downstairs I was surprised to see the downstairs was still very busy. I'm the waiter would have rather not have had to cover both the upstairs and the downstairs, but we were courteous and tipped well. I'm sure we'll go back and try them again. I really like the ambiance of the patio. It seemed like a great place to enjoy dinner and drinks on a beautiful evening. ",0,0,1,0,0

 A classy, fun place to go for a nice change of pace. I like cigars, and I enjoy a good drink (away from the douchebagg-y Old Town scene), and this place fits the bill well. Great selection of cigars that are well-kept in a walk in humidor, great selection of beer as well as spirits. I'm not a frequent whiskey drinker, so I can't speak to the fairness of those prices, but the smokes and beer are fairly priced in my opinion. Friendly, helpful staff (in regards to both service and making a selection)....aside from the stench left on our clothes the next day, we enjoy this place thoroughly. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've eaten at Pure four times, for both lunch and dinner. The drinks are pretty good, the food not so much. On my last visit I ordered the quesadilla special, thinking it would be like every other quesadilla I've ever had (grilled flour tortillas stuffed with cheese and meat). Pure's quesadillas are more like empanadas - fried masa turnovers. I took one bite and left the rest untouched. When the server asked if I wanted a to go box I declined, saying I didn't like the food. Later I had to ask the server to remove the charge from my bill. She actually said she hadn't planned on taking the charge off and would need to ask the manager first. The manager was nice about it and said that they need to do a better job of explaining the quesadilla. I agree. So, learn from my experience and don't expect to get grilled, cheese stuffed flour tortillas when you order a quesadilla. Oh, and they don't serve nachos either. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Very fun rides: I had a blast on every single ride. No exception, even if I practically let my sphincter almost released the feces I was holding in when I kept hearing scary cracking noises on ""Le Monstre"". 5/5 Staff: Mostly bored staff, you can tell they are bored out of their mind and they probably don't get many rotations. The problem is some staff members are incompetent. On the Cobra, I was locked too high and I didn't touch the floor. I told the guy who just ignored me and smiled at me before launching me into a ride of despair. After I got off the Cobra, at my best friend's amusement, I involuntarily walked like a cowboy for the next 10 minutes. The G-force tanked in by my crotch during those loops was atrocious! On the Orbit, I nearly had a heart attack. The guy DID NOT LOCK MY FUCKING SEAT. The top part was LOOSE. When I reached the top, the top part extended completely and the belt started slipping out as my spine stretched and extended. I FREAKED OUT so hard I almost left an aerial trail of urine in the air. Jesus Christ man, lock the damn thing properly. 1/5. Food: OH MY GOD I LOVE GETTING FAT AT LARONDE. It feels so good yet so bad but then it feels good on the tongue so it makes it okay. That's pretty much all there is to say. Fully recommending the Nutella beaver tails. (Great selection in general too but don't expect healthy stuff) 3/5 (-2 because it's expensive. Very expensive) Overall 3/5 because of the staff and poor management of the staff but the rest is pretty fun. The lines however are decently sized but SOOOOOOOOOO SLOW compared to Canada's Wonderland. They BARELY move. It's IMPOSSIBLE to go on the Goliath or the Vampire passed 12pm. Don't even try. Not worth the 2 hour wait. Try to aim it on a Wednesday before elementary school/highschool starts.

 I have been dreaming about a place to get a Belgian waffle with ice cream and fresh fruit on top for god only knows how long. Yesterday after a very long day at work I stopped in here after seeing it driving by and ordered the Belgian waffle combo with strawberries vanilla frozen yogurt and whipped cream. I will make this sweet and simple just like this place is, it was absolutely amazing, definitely worth it for the price, and a new regular spot of mine as of yesterday. The yogurt is fresh and tastes great, everything is fresh sliced including the fruit, and no 1 knows how to cook a Belgian waffle like these girls. I haven't tried the crepes yet but they have 1 called chicken alfredo savory crepe, and who I could think of a better lunch or dinner treat then that?! My advice?

 Went to Vegas for a one day/night birthday trip and didn't want to spend too much on a room so when I saw that the Luxor was only $50 I went for it since I had always liked the Luxor and enjoyed my stay the last time I was there. Unfortunately that was in the 90's and I didn't think that they hadn't updated, fixed or properly maintained anything since the last time I was there! I had no idea, I wish I came here first. You know that show, Life After People? Yeah, that's what it looks like here. It seems like nothing had been changed or fixed since this place was first built, it's actually really sad! Good: Hmm I can't really think of anything... I'd say my memories of this place Bad: Parking garage SUCKS! We parked at Mandalay Bay because the parking garage at the Luxor is so small and awkward. If you don't care if you get a door ding and you can find a spot then it's fine I guess The layout of this place is so hard to navigate, every time we left the room we got lost. The customer service here was just ok, we tried to do early check in and were told we would be called when the room was ready -- we never got a call. The hallways were dirty and had what looked like mold along the top of the ceiling and in cracks where the wall was attached to the railing. The elevator was so sketchy and rickety, the panels and the door were shaking and flopping around literally! That was the scariest elevator I've ever been in. If you're not going to update your hotel rooms you can at the very least update the elevators! Also, you can't even tell that you have to put your room key in to make it go! The room was pretty bad. - The ""non-smoking"" room had cigarette burns in the chairs, on the wall and on the velor blanket. - The wall paper was peeling off in the bathroom and was mis-matched & stained in the rest of the room. - The beds were hard, springy and bowed after years and years of use. - The chair cushion was stained and worn down. - The varnish on the armor and on other drawers was worn off where the knobs were. - The ""comforter"" was like a thin sheet which didn't cover the stained bottom mattress. - The carpet seemed newer than other things in the room however it was still stained and dirty - The AC only worked well when the blinds were closed, in the other room we got it barely worked. - The TV was fuzzy/had bad reception - The paint on the bottom of the bathroom door had water damage and the paint was all bubbled, actually the entire door and door frame was really gross, it was dirty and stained as well. - The pillows had random stains and one didn't even have a pillowcase! So because everything was so gross we refused to get into the bed and froze our asses off all night long. Didn't take a shower there because I would probably end up dirtier. I keep reading about free water, not in my room! However there was a Las Vegas Photo book that the last guest left! So overall this used to be a really nice place but it's definitely been neglected and has become just downright disgusting. I would say you get what you pay for but I would never pay to have to stay in a place like that. Unfortunately that's the last time I'll be staying at the Luxor. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My wife Carrie and I had procrastinated rather badly when it came to selecting our officiant. Fortunately, I found Matt Nathanson's First Officiant website! Matt agreed to meet us on pretty short notice. We had three appointments with potential officiants that weekend, but as soon as we left that Starbucks after a half-hour meeting with Matt, we both knew he was our guy. He was obviously very intelligent, friendly, funny, charming - and yet extremely efficient. We immediately felt at ease with him, and booked him for our atheist wedding ceremony. Matt immediately went to work on our ceremony, which had a couple of odd twists and included a beer mini-ceremony. He laid out our options clearly and concisely, and we had a very easy time picking and choosing from the many choices Matt gave us in ceremony themes. On the day of the ceremony and reception, Matt arrived on time and was impeccably dressed. We didn't do - or need, apparently - a rehearsal. Matt simply took charge of the ceremony and calmly guided us, and our three ""guest speakers,"" through the ceremony smoothly and easily. He made it seem effortless! His professionalism was beyond reproach, and the ceremony went off absolutely perfectly, without so much as a minor glitch. Matt conducted everything with just the right touch, funny at times (especially when recounting some details of our courtship) and earnest when appropriate. We couldn't have asked for a better ceremony or a better officiant! Matt was also well prepared after the ceremony for the signing of the marriage certificate, which he handled with his customary friendly efficiency. Matt's fee is very reasonable, as well, especially in light of the highly superior service he offers. Easy to work with. Totally accommodating. Perfectly professional. These phrases describe Matt Nathanson and First Officiant. Carrie and I cannot recommend him more highly! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I really like it here. It's a lot of fun, and the food is really yummy. It's fun to see grandmas and bikers hanging out in one place.

I am not a big pork eater, so I can't really comment on the barbecue stuff, although the people I am with always rave about it.

 Overall my experience at Gadzooks was a dissappointment. I had been excited to try this place for months. First, the customer experience is extremely lacking. The place was so quiet. There was no music, no tvs; just the awkward sound of echoing conversation from the other patrons. Not the worst thing ever though. I stared at the menu for at least five minutes before any aknowledgement. Then, the only words from behind the counter were ""what are you getting?"" For a new place, a little helpful guidance or possibly some explaination would be great. Especially when the have several types of tortillas, meats, cheeses and sauces. I don't really know what I want yet, because I don't understand whats going on yet. everone was grumpy, except the gal at the cash register. ;/ Presentation was not great either. The ceramic dishes wer nice, sturdy and cooled quickly. The to-go packaging was really neat as well. What wasn't neat, was the soup dish. It was a cup. Like, a paper cup that you put a fountain soda in. Uh... that seems pretty ratchet. no soup bowls, or paper soup cups? Also, the food along the toppings line was just sitting in an empty steam/cooling table in what looked like storage containers. Also, they only have 2, very small trash cans that were almost un-noticeable. Napkins, straws, silverware: all seemingly happhazardly thrown in a divider next to the fountain.Did they rush to open so quick, that they cut a few corners? It defintiely seems like it. They probably should have waited another month, so that customers would have a genuine ""WOW' experience. Next was the food. Simply put, I didn't like it. I can admit that the reason for this was no fault of the establishment, but my own personal tastes. It just wasn't my type. They definitely have some decent options but they were missing an obvious staple. BEEF! At least, I didn't see any, and as I stated earlier, the employees were less than helpful, so if there was a beef option with a zany nickname, I had no idea. The tortillas were either corn, or a corn/flour hybrid. I prefer flour, so they werent my favorite. The rating i am giving here is based 90% on my experience, not so much the food. Final thought: After much built-up anticipation, I was underwhelmed when I got in, and left feeling hungry and frustrated. Hopefully, in a few months when I give it another shot, some noticeble customer service improvmnets will have been made. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Can't believe I never reviewed this--I've been going to Cha Cha since 2004, with a year-long break when I was out of town. When I got back after my absence, I was very disappointed to discover that Janet was gone, but I couldn't be happier with Gen doing my hair! I keep my hair in various shades of hot pink, red, and orange, with a fairly funky/spiky style, but Gen also cuts the hair of two other grad students of my acquaintance who are much more conservative in their hair choices, and she makes them look great, too. She's very good about giving people what THEY want, whatever that might be, but she also always has input of her own to pin down a vague idea I might have into something that looks awesome on my actual head. Seriously, I think the worst thing about actually graduating and leaving Madison will be having to find someone to replace Gen. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've been a student at Trapeze U for 3 years. I never even knew I wanted to do flying trapeze. This school is outstanding! The instructors are experienced, trapeze professionals, who are super encouraging and supportive. You will be amazed at what you will learn. Even if you're afraid of heights like I am, or think you can't do it, the staff finds a way to make you successful. It is so much fun. I've been to other schools across the country and Trapeze U is by far the best. You don't have to be crazy athletic or in the best of shape to do it.

 I'm a big fan of this place, but I'm not a big fan of their 10 dollar cover charge. I guess I can look at it as paying for the entertainment because I never get close enough to the stage to tip. Although, I have noticed that there is not always a cover, and sometimes it is cheaper, but I can't remember when all of that crap happens. Basically, you've got a big split level room (extremely dangerous stairs for drunks) with a really long bar on one side, a tiny bar on another, and a slightly raised stage up in the front. The place is always packed, and you've got to fight for seats sometimes. I hear they serve food, but I never get it. I would hate to have to depend on a waitress. Tip: just go to the bar to order drinks, don't waste your time with a server unless it is early on in the evening. The music is a lot of fun. They take lots of requests and put a piano spin on all of our favorite current songs. For birthday people they embarrass the hell out of them, and if the person is female, crazy raunchiness WILL ensue. They tell lots of dirty jokes, sing filthy songs, and swear a lot. This place is definitely not for the easily offended or the prudish. I love it all, and it cracks me up. My favorite part is when the staff gets up on the bar and on stage, and sometimes on the pianos and starts doing some weird choreographed dance. It's a lot of fun, and sometimes the hot guys take off the shirts and the girls engage in pseudo-lesbian action. A little something for everyone. Bottom line, it's a lot of fun and everyone should go at least once. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I'm not sure what they did to the pizza the day that Guy Fieri went in there. I checked it out shortly after seeing it on TV. I was less than impressed.

Hodad's in SD is phenominal. Pizzeria Luigi in SD is better than Al Forno. I've been to the best pizza joints in the country and Al Forno is average. I'd eat at Red Devil before I'd eat at Forno.

 Just a heads up, I did not stay at this hotel. I'm just a fan of some of the SBE properties and was in town visiting from Los Angeles and wanted to check it out as I love a great hotel and had high hopes. I also throw large events and often book hotels and so I wanted to check this out as I thought it might be good for one or more of my upcoming shows. To be clear, I can only comment on parking, lobby, gaming and general layout. I had no interaction with the staff. Frustratingly I was disappointed at my experience from driving into to the out-dated detached garage to the non-working elevator in the garage. I honestly expected much more from SLS group. Unfortunately, the word, dated, ""wanna be cool"" come to mind. This reminds me of one of those awful Miami beach hotels that pretends to be Botique, but is more of a fa \ u00e7ade with the Ikea furniture disguised as something supposedly artisti and chic trying just a little to hard and ending up tacky. It's all there too, the Faux plastic ""art"" chairs/couches, the white/black concept etc. As far as my walkthrough. The hallways all the way to the back where they keep check in, were overly dark. Maybe to appear sexy? Not sure, but we actually thought the lights were broken it was so dark. The casino was quiet and the restaurants and bars were cramped together and didn't seem very well thought out more as though they wanted to squeeze as much in as possible. And it appears that Fred Segal is the only retail outlet. Not to be a snob just someone who likes hotels, but I'm guessing that guests accustomed to more Holiday Inn or Ramada Inn will enjoy this place, but only because they don't know better. But for any of you that travel and enjoy a 4-5 star diamond hotels, you'll know when you step in. It feels a little like the SLS took over the Sahara to just say that SLS/Sam Nezarian is now in Vegas. But unfortunately, to really compete with the big boys of lux hotels, you need to actually be a lux hotel, which the SLS is not. All that said, just to be fair, I didn't stay here and I do like SLS Beverly Hills. The hotel is still fairly new, so this is just a heads up for those that were thinking about visiting. Your experience may be different from mine. With enough comments/complaints perhaps SLS will make the improvements necessary to compete at a high level and become a great resort, we can always dream, after all it is Vegas. Until then C'est La Vie. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The Buffet at Aria is not a bad place to go for brunch or dinner, but in a town where every major property features an extravagant buffet, Aria's version falls short. I had brunch at The Buffet twice during my stay. The space is clean and well-kept and the layout is much more straightforward than many other buffets on The Strip. The selection, though, is relatively underwhelming compared to almost all other buffets I have been to (the lone exception being the smaller scale Cafe Lago in Caesar's Palace). The taste of the food is about average--definitely a step above Wynn (the worst of the buffets I have visited) but not quite as good as Bellagio and Paris. I would note, however, that the Eggs Benedict were a major disappointment, and I can't figure out how their ""only Tandoor Oven in a Las Vegas buffet"" comes into play. Service was about par for the course--meaning too few servers trying to staff too many tables. ",0,1,0,0,0

 If I were held at gunpoint tomorrow and forced to choose only one thing I miss about my hometown, I would definitely live to tell the tale. That's Rentertainment is the obvious answer. Where else can you bump into your high school math teacher while combing the LGBT section for My Beautiful Laundrette? Where else can you methodically work your way through practically every detective show ever shown on Mystery during the 90s? Where else could you simultaneously rent 500 Days of Summer, the third disc of the fourth series of MI5, and that obscure Korean movie your friend's been pestering you to watch? The very first time I went to That's Rentertainment was the same day I watched Colin Firth in Pride & Prejudice for the first time. My mom and I rented the whole 6-VHS (I know!) set, and when it came time to pop in the third installment, we realized that we had a second copy of volume two instead. The shock! The horror! We ran to the car and hightailed it over to That's Rentertainment. Not only did they have the third tape ready and waiting for us, they commiserated with us over our terrible case of Darcy-interruptus. We went home, and binged on the rest of the show until around 1 AM. Although the VHS tapes are (mercifully) gone, That's Rentertainment continues to be the best place in town (and, I can say with certainty, anywhere) to get your home entertainment fix. I love it so much there that I even make a habit of getting 25 cent gumballs from the dispenser by the door and enjoying their stale je ne sais quoi all the way home, with a grin plastered on my face, despite my aching jaw, and two or three DVDs warming the passenger seat.

 Good chips and salsa is about all the positive I have to say about Manuel's on this visit. The food quality was lacking - oversalted and grisley steak, greasy quesadilla my daughter rung out before eating and wilted lettuce strewn about the plates. All of the prices are REALLY high for the quality of the food and it seems like there are NO more affordable options. Even the kids menu is high ($5.50 plus extra for juice) and their emphatic NO SUBSTITUTIONS is frustrating. The happy hour menu looks more promising but for a Family, it's a NO THANK YOU. Sadly we won't be back to Manuel's any time soon. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've used Yelp before, never left a review. I've opened an account strictly for the purpose of warning the furniture-buying world to NEVER, EVER buy anything from Ashley. I have had nothing but hoops to jump through and headaches since purchasing a dining room table that was delivered damaged, not only before delivery (as evidenced by the manufacturer's repair on the corner), but IN delivery where the table was clearly dropped with horrible damage. If I could post pictures on here I would. We bought the table in preparation for Christmas dinner, and had to take time off work to accept delivery because the next available Saturday delivery time was well into January. The table was delivered the Friday before Christmas12/21/12. The table was horribly damaged in the delivery, had a large wood chip peeled out on one end that was ignored and laquered over, and manufacturer-repaired damage on one corner. We immediately reported the damage and were told they'd send a tech out to look before replacing. Fast forward ONE MONTH LATER, to when the tech comes out. He tells us we can't exchange once we accept, despite the bad damage and our timely reporting. We call customer service who insists we allow repair before they'd allow replacement. We made it clear that we were not accepting repair in lieu of replacement, and the tech tried to do his thing. Well, the corner still has cracks, the surface where the drop damage was repaired is uneven, and there's filler on the end that wasn't sanded away. Customer service called me 3-4 times last week to get pictures of the damage, this despite my telling them I work 50 hours/week and would do take and upload pictures ASAP. Well, finally get 10 pics and upload and email them Friday night. Why, then, does the service department call me at 8:30 a.m. Saturday morning? I called them back. ""Sir, we still haven't received your pictures."" ""Really? I just sent them last night, and from two separate email accounts to make sure they went through. I sent 10 pictures of all the damage."" ""Oh, that's why. Our email can only get two pictures at a time."" Seriously, Ashley?! So, I proceed to send 5 separate emails, with two pictures per. Later that afternoon I get a call, ""We want to send another tech out to get a second opinion."" I said, ""Of course you do, and how long will that take, ANOTHER month? We work 8am-7pm, M-F, so it has to be a weekend."" ""Well, we have this and this date."" ""Are either of those a Saturday?"" ""No, our next Saturday is 3 weeks out."" Well, guess that's what it'll have to be based on what I JUST TOLD YOU. In the end, we've paid almost $1,500 for a dining room table, received it badly damaged with damage in more than one place. Ashley CHARGED US for HORRIBLE SHIPPING and they have horrible customer service. We bought our bedroom furniture and couches at Walker for decent prices and free delivery!! Should've stuck with them! FOLLOW UP: Got a call from customer service for an exchange date, and they're going to exchange the table. Better late than never! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Game is, unlike Gavin, my first port of call when I am looking for games. It seems that Gamestation tend to have better 'special offers', whilst Game has overall cheaper prices. When you are buying a console like a PS3 or an Xbox 360, the best bet would be to check out both and have a little browse at online shops too, as the prices can vary very much and you can make a great saving if you are patient. In terms of this particular branch, it is actually pretty small, but they do fit a great amount into it and have a good range of first and second hand items. Me and my flatmates picked up a couple of pre-owned Xbox 360 controllers from here and they were pretty cheap and have worked a treat so far. They also have a good range of games and if they don't, it's always worth asking a member of staff because sometimes the new items that have been traded in haven't been put out on the shelves yet.

 Myself, my husband and our son went on a Thursday nite and we were one of three tables there (at 7:00p) and it is as stale and boring as last time we went (years ago.) They got the steak and I got a sandwich (nothing else even sounded good). My husband liked the green chili Mac n cheese the most and the toasted bread of my club sandwich was so dry it cut not only my palate but my mouth as well. I could not eat it! Steaks were smaller than before and the sides were just ok. My onion rings were over fried, dry and tasteless. My husbands first beer on draft was Bud and $1.50 and the re-fill(?) was billed as a Coors and $2.50?? He swears it was a Bud!! Probably will never go again since there are many better choices to eat in that area. I did like their raspberry tea though. ",0,1,0,0,0

 After reviewing several reviews we decided to go to dinner at Gallaghers Steakhouse and boy were we disappointed. It started with a distracted waiter who took forever to take our drinks and meal order. A table that arrive after us actually had their order taken before ours. It was kind of surreal but with all the great reviews we thought it would be worth the wait. Well, it wasn't! Our sirloin steak was bland and rather fatty. The spinach was way too salty and disgusting. Highlights of the evening was the mashed potatoes but this does not save their rating. This was a pricey adventure and one that won't be repeated.

 I have a new favorite breakfast spot! I noticed several benches outside and I can only assume that is because sometimes the line is out the door from people waiting to get into this place. Lucky us though we got in before a rush came through and nabbed a spot without wait. The inside is clean and the employees are very friendly. Seating seems limited for the amount of people wanting inside. I saw the occupancy sign said it could seat just 50! If BabyStacks keeps putting out such a good breakfast they might have to move to a bigger location. The coffee here is awesome! It is full of good flavor. This is one of those cups of coffee I just really enjoyed sipping on and could have stayed all day just for that! I figured my first visit wouldn't be complete if I didn't order pancakes. With all of the options BabyStacks offers for pancakes how does anybody ever decide?! I chose the ""Banana Cream Pie"" pancakes. OMG! These pancakes are the b-e-s-t I have ever had!! The pancakes are so darn thick and fluffy and have such good flavor. There was banana in the pancake batter as well sliced fresh all over the pancakes. It also had banana cream sauce, almonds and pie crust on it. I only ordered a *short* stack and couldn't finish my meal. The short stack cost just $5.75. What a great price! Others in my party grubbed on ""Carot Cakes"" and ""PB & Bananas W/Chocolate Chips"" and of course I had to try a bite of both of those. I would order everything at our table over and over again it was just all so good. I will be back for sure! Our server was excellent. I asked him what his favorite thing on the menu was and he suggested ""Portuguese Sausage And Eggs"". He said they have a ""Garlic Rice"" that pairs very well with this dish. He had me at garlic rice! I need to try this rice for sure at some point. They have a great kids menu at affordable prices. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Finally! A pizza joint to call our own here in Summerlin! And a PLUS??? There's wine here too! Due Forni is a Pizza & Wine restaurant that is very quaint and trendy at the same time. The ambiance is light and relaxed. On our first try here, my husband and I were on ""date night,"" in other words, ""sans enfants."" We started with the Chef's Platter of meats and cheeses. We were very impressed to hear the server reciting every item on the platter with ease, from how she pronounced it (well, what do I know, I'm not Italian) to knowing the origin of each item. Pretty good! We commented on our journey we once had to Henderson (no, not a region of Italy, just the other side of Las Vegas) to Valley Cheese & Wine, in which we had sought out some specialty meats. Surprisingly, the server knew what we were talking about and suggested we try their selection! It's always good to know that your server is well-versed with his/her menu. PLUS! The pizza was amazing! Melt-in-your-mouth delicious! Roman crust or Neopolitan crust, your choice! What really stood out, in my opinion, was their Panzanella Salad, made with arugula, onion, tomato, toasted pistachios, etc. with a light balsamic vinaigrette! Just the way I like it! The other stand-out-in-the-crowd item came from their dessert menu! Lord Have Mercy! You must try their Sweet Bufala Ricotta, rich ricotta with honey and pistachios! Good Lord! It was amazing! Lastly, we took a stab at Due Forni a second night, this time with the children. Gotta admit, unless your kids have a worldly palate, they won't be as impressed as the adults are. They did enjoy the Chef's Platter, but as a suggestion for pizza? Stick to the Due Forni pizza, tomato, mozzarella, sausage and bacon (all exquisite ingredients), minus the oregano and peppers. Great place!!! Will definitely return for more!!! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Horrible customer service! I made a reservation at Brick for my bachelorette party. When we called they said they could seat 12 people no problem. We showed up on time for the reservation and they said there was someone else who had already made a reservation and they could try to seat us at the bar instead. They had our phone number, but did they call to tell us this? No. So the hostess gets the manager. He apologizes about the reservation, but does not offer accommodations. We ask to receive a discount on the bill or perhaps happy hour pricing, but he says he cannot do anything. Thanks Brick for starting off my important night on a such a bad note. Luckily we were able to get in at 1130 next door and they had amazing customer service, even gave the entire party a free shot without us asking for it. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This is the real thing. I was told by a Korean friend that THIS was the most authentic Korean food in Pittsburgh. I'm sold. We had the giant seafood pancake as an appetizer (it is enough for 4 folks, so it is worth it). I ordered the bento box bolgogi, which was a little smorgasbord of Korean foods and was excellent. My companions ordered stews, one of which was the tofu and seafood stew, also excellent. The stews arrive at the table vigorously boiling in the bowl, which is a bit off putting, but better than it arriving cold... It's well worth going to the Pitt ghetto of South Oakland for the experience of eating here. They have a cooler full of beer. When we walked in the place was filled with Koreans and, which suggests that my friend was correct. Later Pitt students began to fill the place ( I was told to go early, which is good advice for Saturday night). ",0,0,0,1,0

 My husband and I stayed at The Inn on the Mexican War Streets during our vacation this past week and we absolutely loved it. The Inn itself is gorgeous inside and out and Karl is a fabulous and gracious host. Our room, which included a private bath and sitting area was beautiful, clean, and very comfortable. The free wi-fi came in handy and was easily accessible from our room (the Emma room). Breakfast, though self serve, was good. There is a waffle maker and a toaster for English muffins or bagels. Fruit, pastries, cereal, and yogurt were also available, along with hard-boiled eggs. Street parking was never a problem and we felt very safe while staying at the Inn. We would highly recommend it for anyone visiting the Pittsburgh area. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Even though the address says Trade St, this place is on the back corner of the Hearst Tower on College and 7th. The best thing about this place is that it's open until 4am on the weekends. Don't bother going there between 1:30-3:00, however, since it is generally filled with drunken club goers. If you happen to BE one of those drunken club goers, then you should fit right in. Just don't get too rowdy or the cops will drag you out of line and toss you outside. I don't bother with the slices or premade calzones anymore...they are ok, but if I want left-overs I'll make them myself. Get a whole pizza here or try the wings (not bad for a pizza place). The best time to go here is early evening on a weekend night when the weather is nice. They will usually open up the windows, letting the breeze and sounds of the city flow in. I like to sit by the open window with a friend, a large pizza, and some beers and watch the clubbers roll by on their way to the alley. It's no hot tub in the Rockies, but it beats eating hot pockets in front of the tube. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Maybe it's just because I'm from Las Vegas and we don't have any of the super awesome cool stuff they have here in Phoenix metro, but this place is super awesome! I mean seriously. A movie theater, lots of shops and dinning, fountains and lights everywhere anchored by a huge arena with an awesome Coyotes hockey team inside. What more can you ask for?! Miuns one star because of the location (I'm spoiled, not use to driving more than 15 minutes to anything), and also the selection of stores and restaurants seem a little short. It feels like there is suppose to more to this. Other than that, I'm for sure a fan of this awesomeness! ",0,0,0,1,0

 First, overall impressions are very good. This is a nice, simple, hole in the wall. It's a simple, friendly introduction to Vietnamese cuisine. It is what it claims to be - a ""Vietnamese Deli"". You order at the counter and your food is brought to you. I had the Beef Pho which had a very nice broth (once I added the requisite amount of chili sauce - personal preference) with tasty meat and rice noodles. The amount of meat was a bit skimpy, but ok. My friend had the chicken salad which was basically a salad topped with grilled chicken meat, which was accompanied by a very tasty dressing. I had a nice green tea with pomegrenate that was very tasty. Didn't sample the Vietnamese Coffee as I didn't want to have a particularly late night. This is a place I'd come back to for a simple meal before or after a movie at the nearby Harkins Scottsdale 101. Some of the possible negatives are price (a bit high, but heck it is Scottsdale, and the rent must be a small fortune at that shopping center), and the lack of choice. Grades (a new tradition in my reviews) Overall: B (there is only one grade for food, and nothing meriting an overall grade reduction) Service - No Grade - as there is no real table service here. Folks at the counter were nice though Food - B - Above average. Good, fresh, simple Vietnamese food, albeit overpriced. Drinks - No Grade - as I didn't sample the Vietnamese Coffee, and no alcoholic beverages are served here. ",0,0,0,1,0

 In Sanskrit, 'Metta' means ""loving kindness"", perhaps this is all you need to know about the studio. Every class is different, but each class shares the common thread of this definition. Teachers are professional, yet friendly (no yogatude), and the casual atmosphere makes everyone feel welcome. The connection with the Phoenician is so cool as it's fun to practice in a beautiful environment as well as at the sweet spot on Indian School. From expectant Mom's to seasoned veteran yogi's -- feel free to just be you within your practice at Metta. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This is our favorite in Scottsdale. We loved here so much from our last trip. We came back! Their salad is exceptional with light dressing with lots of flavors. My husband and I were impressed from appetizer to dessert! Love their ambience as it's casual yet comfortably classy. Price is just right for the portion and the quality of food.

 This is a two-star hotel, so I'm giving it two stars to be accurate. But I'm also not thrilled with the Excalibur. So the rating can be explained either way. We're talking cheeeeeap rooms here, people. I paid $30 a night to stay here for a week; compared with NYNY across the street charging $190 on the same days. When I travel for work, I travel cheap. So this dumpy place works. But no way would I skimp and book this place for a vacation. If you're like me and enjoy luxe and glam accommodations with your travel, stay the hell away from here. Some irksome things: - no one at the valet when I rolled up around midnight on a week day - no one wanted to help me lug my giant printer up to my room (liability reasons) - no one in general to take my luggage (so I had to make two trips) - two lights were out when I got to my room - cord to the wired internet was broken - my door wouldn't auto-lock on closure one night, so I had to slam it multiple times until it decided to wise up... - ...this turned out to be a bad idea, because I got back to my room and it wouldn't open T_T But this whole review isn't one big downer. Any staff I actually encountered throughout Excalibur, for the most part, really amped up an otherwise lackluster stay. 99% of the people working here are all smiles, all service, all the time. It's nuts. - David, technician, just awesome. Great personality, super fast, knowledgeable at what he does. Doesn't come on up into your space and leave a mess. - Angel, front desk, I actually like you. I know how it is to be exhausted and just wanna go home, and you know what, I'm glad that whole thing we had to deal with worked out. - Everyone working at Dick's who would ""compliment"" my blue hair every day. You dudes are funny. - People trying to get you to sign up for Mlife. How can you guys be so friggin friendly after hours of getting the shutdown?? - The security officer in Tower II who was such a gentleman! I'm sure watching a tiny woman carry an industrial sized printer around would worry any chivalrous heart, haha; but he was so courteous and helpful, I'm sad I don't remember his name! Alas, there are so many more names I can't recall. The first technician who came by to fix my internet. The guys working the valet at 1 am. The security who had to bust me into my room. I could go on and on. Bottom line, know that every one of these awesome blossoms keep the gears of Vegas well oiled and contributed to a work-stay that was far more enjoyable than it should have been. Peace. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Opposite experience of the below - excellent service, salad was lackluster.

 I was urged by a friend of mine to hit this buffet, as I had missed it on my Vegas trip last year. We went on a Sat night where it was supposed to be ""gourmet"" night with more selections. It was a pricey buffet, at $77 for both of us. The line was insane. It wrapped around most of the casino. What was horrible about it, was that the buffet on a SAT night, in Las Vegas, closes @10pm. We waited (along with about 100 people behind us) for over an hour to get to the cashier to pay. By that time, it was 9:40pm. I was sure my info was incorrect and the staff would tell me they were open to at least 11. I asked the cashier and she said ""No we close @10"". I said, you are telling me, that I have 20 minutes to inhale my food for $77??"" She said the buffet closes at 10, but they dont put the food away till 10:30, so run around like a nut doing supermarket sweep and fill as many dishes as possible and sit and eat at your table.. I was going to leave, but then I thought I wasted SO MUCH TIME waiting to eat here, and in thinking of my fellow yelpers, I wanted to add my honest review to this site, so I stayed. I also told the staff that they need to have a staff member block off the line, or have a sign there that says ""No entry after this point"", or no entry after 9pm, because all those poor people behind us, who also waited 11/2 to 2 hours to eat would be kicked off the line when it closed @10. Not nice to have people there wasting their time in Vegas when there are 1000000000 other places they could be eating. The food was not impressive. They had awful, runny, split crab legs, sub-par sushi, very tough meat (I had a few different piece of lamb), God awful Chilean sea bass, which is one of my fav dishes, so that was even more disappointing, I also tried the elk and ostrich because it was there. But it was too gamey for me. The lobster ravioli was good, as were the hand rolls. But certainly not worth the wait or the price. You can get the crab legs in almost every other buffet in Vegas. We were also SO SICK after we finished eating! The food went right through us both. We joked about having a $77 laxative. Mirage buffet stood out- it had many different sections and offerings. AND- if you LOVE seafood, do yourself a favor and hit the Rio seafood buffet. (There's a free shuttle from the Paris hotel.) That buffet is in a class by itself. Please see my review. I would not return or recommend the Bellagio buffet. I guess if this was the only buffet you hit in Vegas, you might be impressed. Having been here on vacation before in LV, I have seen way nicer spreads for less $. On an upnote, the hotel itself is gorgeous, and def worth a look in the flower conservatory or see the world's largest chocolate fountain. Good gelato and desserts there. ************UPDATE********** I was so annoyed by my buffet experience that I sent part of this review to Bellagio, hoping they would re vamp their line set up, as to not leave customers out in the lurch with no dinner or food they had to pay $77 for and then scarf down because they close at 10pm. Shockingly to me- the manager called me (now that Im back in Nyc) and offered to comp me 2 tickets to eat there again (which I quickly told him I never would- even for free), or get a refund. So I told him to refund our credit card, and they complied. I was very appreciative of this gesture, but I honestly hope they #1 Improve the food there, and #2 Fix the line set up. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've been in Charlotte for almost a month now, and have only experienced one great disappointment: that there are only two dim sum restaurants in the entirety, AND that they're both half an hour away from me. Why, Dim Sum? Why? Now it seems besides the Dragon Court (which doesn't seem to be wowing people either), the Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant is all I have left. Le sigh. Alright, lament aside and review on, this place did not dress to impress. Outside looked pretty sketch, and upon walking in there, the cook and what looked like the manager were sitting down watching tv. They seemed to be able to afford the down time because there wasn't a soul in the house. I waited awkwardly by the counter, then said, ""Excuse me,"" three times to no avail. Then suddenly, for some reason, the chef looked up, barked something and a waitress came out with my order. First things first: if you are a full-time Dim Sum restaurant, you need to have some staples that come with availability. All sweet items are done ONLY on weekends. This includes the custard tarts, coconut rolls, fried pineapple rolls, ANYTHING that resembles a dessert, and one of the biggest staples of dim sum and one of my personal favorites, zha leung cheung fun, also known as Chinese fried dough wrapped in rice noodle. I know how this may sound, but for those of you who have experienced a good zha leung cheung fun, you know what I'm talkin'bout. That taken off my order, I almost decided to wait for the weekend, BUT I was only 15 out of the thirty minutes away in a car with no air conditioning - I may as well tough the damn thing out. Also up on the list: pork and shrimp dumplings, fried shrimp balls, and chicken feet. This is my usual dim sum test. Something I like and is easy (dumplings), something I hadn't tried before (shrimp balls), and... the feet. You can always tell how good a dim sum place is going to be by their chicken feet. In this case, the chicken feet were cooked moderately well, but had no seasoning whatsoever and what little sauce there was was very bland. The meat in the dumplings tasted good, but had an odd texture of not ground, but pureed. It took me a couple to get used to it. The shrimp balls were huge, and delicious. However, the outside was soggy instead of the crunchy I was hoping for. All in all, hoping for a better dim sum experience. Now all I can do is place my hope in the Dragon Court. Wish me luck.

 This store has cleaned up a lot since the last time I was here. I have been trying really hard to stay away from Walmarts, and going here today reminded me why. They rearranged some of the store to make more sense. The pet food is near the people food and it seems the toy area has increased in size. Over all the store seems cleaner and brighter, which is nice. The non existence customer service is still rampant though as it is with most Walmart locations. I looked for something online, the site said it was in stock here. It was not on the shelve, so I went to the site to store area and it was deserted. I wondered off to the electronics area since it was the only place with workers and computers. I asked someone there to see if it was in stock but they refused to help me. They pointed to some other worker who was walking away and told me to chase her down. I followed her all the way to the break room area but just couldn't catch her in time. That's when I realized how silly that all seemed. Chasing someone down for help. I shouldn't have to chase anyone down when I have a real live person right in front of me whom I'm already talking to. Just help me instead of passing the buck. I guess I needed a reminder of why I've been avoiding this store. ",0,1,0,0,0

 (Chanting, in that well-worn 4 beat cadence) ""OVERRATED...OVERRATED"" The food here is extremely hit-or-miss. Eating here three times, I have been very disappointed twice with my own meal and all three times with some aspect of the dining experience. Their menu sounds good, but is perhaps beyond the skill of its staff, as they often fail to deliver. Sauces are either too thin or too thick, either tasteless or too salty, and every time at least one item was served too cold (even when it was just 2 of us). If you are the type that likes to occasionally order an appetizer for your entree, think again: many apps are really skimpy. Also, food service can be very slow at times, as I think they stretch their servers too thin. They also have very few vegetarian options, which surprises me, based upon their clientele. Notice how all these comments are about food? That is because their alcohol service, selection, and quality are all beyond reproach. Their prices, including their alcohol prices, are pretty high for what you get. For the alcohol, I can justify this to cover the cost of carrying obscure barley wines (tremendous); to charge high prices for the food, is absolutely unacceptable. EAT at V. Picasso's, Courier Cafe, Bunny's, Tang Dynasty, The Great Impasta, Xinh Xinh, Black Dog, Silver Creek, or even Siam Terrace, then DRINK at Crane Alley. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have to say that I really don't like writing bad reviews but I just must recount a recent experience with Jose is Your Tailor that was VERY different from my original review. As I said in my original sentiments, I had a great first experience here and was VERY happy and content with two beautiful dresses... so when I had a black blazer and vintage fur vest to tailor in 2 days I knew this guy can do the job. I ran over there with my clothing. He was pleasant, measured me and said he can complete the job in time... I left happy... When I came back to pick it up though... well I turned my smile upside down... firstly, he informed me that he was unable to do my vest bc it was ""too thick"" for the machine huh???.... disappointing! He was able to tailor my black jacket but quoted me SIXTY dollars!! really?? the jacket cost me $30 on sale!!! Now I admit it was my mistake to drop off the items without insisting on a pre-job quote (I asked how much it would cost but he told me he can't know until he does the work) I was furious!! this is ridiculously over-priced! I talked him down to 40 bucks in increments of 5 dollars... then I just gave him the money and walked out of there.... wah wah wahhhh.... hmmm still debating whether I'd ever go back there again.

 This is the nicest dump I've ever stayed in, and I've been forced to stay in some dumps in my day: like the Gold Coast in the '80s. The decor is dated, not in a retro-chic way but more a Salvation Army thrift store way. Frequent guests will bring their own sheets and pillows. The 'free breakfast' will get you exactly the value you pay for: weak coffee, thin OJ, extra-thin bagel or mini-muffin plus some tired fruit. Served 6am-9am ONLY; the door will be locked promptly at 9 so come early as no amount of pleading with the cleaning woman will get you an untoasted bagel or a cup of the coffee she is about to dump. Oh, and one last thing: ask for room 364. It offers adequate WiFi and a lovely view of the parking lot, plus the phone doesn't work (no disturbing late-night calls) and you'll enjoy the soothing sounds of a waterfall (the bathroom ceiling drips all night long if 464 showers in the evening)! Would be but a one-star, except for $199 per week, I got what I paid for. Oh and the sunset view across the parking lot isn't bad! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I had been going to Fresh and Easy since it opened when I lived in Mesa. When I moved to Scottsdale I was super disappointed that there were none in the area, but now there is! This is a great market to go to for a quick trip. It can't replace all your grocery shopping needs, but has some specialty items that I can't live without... such as their hummus, pretzel chips, fresh raviolis and pizza dough. They also have a nice selection of premade meals that can serve 1-2 people if you're in a hurry. Overall, I have been very pleased with all their store brand products. They also have a decent wine selection that is inexpensive. The only downside is most of their produce and cold products have a relatively short shelf life. If you live in the area, they also send out coupons in the mail for $3-5 off your next purchase, you just have to remember to bring the coupon! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was excited to try this place because I enjoy going to Town Square. A couple of my favorite stores are there; Bebe and MAC to name a few. I was at a Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce Event and decided with my bud Kamila to check it out. I remember Nu Sanctuary and the decor and food which in the beginning were really good. Well, the ambiance when I walked in was OK. I wanted to sit at the bar but we were invited to share a table with friends. The waiter came over and was almost nice. I am a wine drinker. There is one Chardonnay on the menu and maybe four other wines to choose from. It's an Italian eatery so I was very surprised. I lived in Europe almost 15 years and the San Francisco bay area more than 10, I was kind of expecting a honkin wine list. Maybe some Grappa, Armagnac, Cognac, whatever. The price for the wine was reasonable though at $7. Never heard of the vineyard. The waiter could care less. Two of my friends ordered meatballs and Kam and I decided on a Caprese and a Chopped salad but the smaller version; both for $5.95 a piece. I literally got two small slivers of mozzarella and two even smaller slices of tomato. No bread. The chopped salad was even skimpier. Not enough to fill your back tooth. Keep in mind I am 5'4 and 110 lbs but I eat like I'm goin to the chair. My meatball dinner bud asked for bread and the waiter told him he didn't order enough food to warrant having bread. Huh? I was MORTIFIED! Who says this?? The waiter brings out a large dinner plate with two thin slices of hard bread. I looked at him like he was a car, and it wasn't a Ferrari... There were a lot of guys in the restaurant. Compared to women: 15 to 1. I found the staff to be confused and arrogant with the exception of one girl who had no authority but was gracious, the others had frowns and smirks and were ill trained. I realize that it may not be a high priced place HOWEVER..... If people don't line up to come back you will go out of business faster than you can say wtf Stevie D and Carla Pellegrino why?? I adore her and I liked Bacio. I will pay 15 for a glass of wine and a DECENT salad slash meal. Pacify me.... Fix it guys or you will go under faster than you can say where's the bread....

 Ehhh. Not sure what all the hype was about. I guess i had to find out the hard and expensive way that coming here wasn't really worth my time. These hot dogs are boiled-something i can get at a baseball game. I prefer a grilled hot dog that has char-marks and some snap to it when you bite in. I ordered the basic chili dog; the toppings overpowered the hot dog, there was so much going with this hot dog that i couldn't even enjoy it. I actually ended up eating it with a fork n knife because the massive amounts of toppings tore the bun apart. That seriously detracts from any hot dog experience.

 I should probably go with two stars because of the service my friend received, but I'm giving it three because my service was okay. While staying at the Stratosphere my girlfriend's and I decided to have a spa day and as this is the in-house salon, we figured we'd give it a shot. The goods: The front desk staff and the cosmetician that gave me my wrap were super friendly and welcoming. The salon itself is bright and cheery and the showers were well kept. The not-goods: They were almost 30 minutes late getting me in for my wrap. The showering instructions for after the wrap were less than stellar. My friend was rushed thru her wrap (which was exactly the same as mine) and didn't get the included massage because according to her lady they were backed up for the shower. Also, both of my companions dealt some woman that did their manicures that they found rude and abrasive. Overall, it was so-so, but for the amount of money spent I could have gone to a much nicer salon where everyone is treated the same. ",0,0,1,0,0

When she noticed I did not want dressing for the salad she included a second cup of salsa. Portions are large for the price.

 Unfortunately, I have to leave Yan's a 2-star review. We used to go here all the time when we first moved down to Goodyear. It's close to home, and we had heard great things about it. Those turned out to be true--great, fast service, yummy food, nice employees, etc. However, the last 3 or 4 times ended up being not so great at all. At first, we just thought it was a fluke. Then, the 2nd time, coincidence? After that, we have decided that we will probably not go there again unfortunately :( Sad, because we used to love Yan's! We aren't sure what happened, but here are the negatives we've experienced lately: We ALWAYS get the Crab Rangoons with our meals every time. (By the way, we always call in and order take-out rather than eating there since it's so close to home.) They are usually great with the sauce they come with, but the last 3-4 times have not been so great. One time, they forgot to give us the sauce, which we did not notice until we had started eating our food. They are difficult to eat without sauce ;) The next few times, we had sauce, but it was extremely runny and seemed watered down... literally. The taste was completely diluted and different, as if they had run out or something and wanted to re-use what they had left. Not good :( The fact that it happened more than once is concerning. We always call in and order it as take-out, and they tell us 10-15 minutes (or something along those lines.) We always arrive at the expected time, or sometimes a little later, and walk in to pick it up. At first, they were a few minutes later than expected, but lately it seems like they don't even put the order in until we walk into the restaurant. When I say ""seems like,"" I mean we ask for our order, and they tell the cooks to make it right in front of us. Ok, so why did we call in and order over the phone if we could have just saved ourselves the phone call and just walked in to order? So we sit and wait for the ~15 minutes while they make our order. This is totally fine, because it is fresh and usually good food, but it takes twice the amount of estimated time (and again, why even bother calling in if they don't put the order in until you arrive??!) This has happened several times now, not just once or twice. The same dishes we used to love at Yan's don't seem to be of the same quality they used to be. They aren't as flavourful, and the meat seems to be very ""fatty"" at times. It wasn't always like this... It just seems like corners are being cut to make an extra buck. I know that ""times are tough"" right now, as much as I hate to keep saying that, and that most businesses are struggling right now, but it's just sad to see it happen right in front of us. We used to love going here, but now we just don't feel like spending the money if we are not satisfied. Hopefully it changes back to being a great place, but until then I have to leave then a 2-star review. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I had heard how great this place was so I had to try it. First impression was an arrogant hostess who was more concerned with marking off her floor chart or station map than greeting me. I was sat and ordered the Lobster Bisque which was amazing, the bread was awesome. My server Jade was excellent as well. I ordered the Veal Marsala and it was extremely bland and tasteless. Not even the sauce could save it, Marsala usually has a nice, nutty flavor. It had no flavor at all, very disappointing. After seeing the decor and tasting the bread and the Bisque I was expecting a great meal, it was far from it. A microwave meal has more flavor..... ",0,1,0,0,0

 Came to Charlotte on a business trip and decided to try this place since it was conveniently across the street to my hotel. It was a nice restaurant and seems like a good happy hour spot since it has an outdoor area that faces the street. I was disappointed that with only 4 strict combo options that you aren't able to substitute any of the items. I decided to go with the combo that had a carne asada taco, chicken taco and pork avocado enchilada. The tacos were really tasty but really greasy. The enchilada had a cinnamon flavor which I thought was weird; not bad, just different. The margarita was ok; nothing too exciting. I was surprised that the service wasn't better since it seemed like a light day. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Came here last night post Terry Fator with some of my favorite Yelpers. Kudos for the staff for letting us take over the patio. We were loud and obnoxious, so we all had a fabulous time. The only Korean food I have ever encountered was the BBQ; who doesn't like grilled meats? Anyway, not knowing anything, I let the experts order. I for the most part had no idea what I ate. None of it stuck because I didn't particularly care for it. The beef nonsoup dishes were the best, although not memberable. I found the tastes to be either lackluster, underwhelming, or just spicy. Nothing that really hit it out of the ballpark for me or piqued my interest in venturing into Korean cuisine anytime soon or ever again for that matter. Service was alright. We had to constantly ask for more silverware, more cups, more tea, more almost everything. I think this is mainly because we were the overzealous group on the patio. Soyo, more like a SOY-NO. Kimchi is not for me. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place really doesn't look like much from the street. It's situated in a strip mall with other nondescript stores around it and a plain blue sign that says simply GIANT HAMBURGERS. But after reading the reviews on here I knew we had to give it a try. So far we have only been there once but it was delicious. I know I want to go back just given how yummy the pies looked alone. I enjoyed my burger and the plate of chili fries my husband got were enough to satisfy us both and then some - we couldn't finish it. I'm happy this place is so close by for us to go and give their other options (including breakfast) a try sometime. When I went I paid with a debit card and accidentally did the math wrong on the total plus tip. A really nice man (I'd assume he was the owner) came over to figure out what I'd meant to put down and hew was so nice! Definitely great service here. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I ordered two blizzards that were on special per television spots. The employee gave me the price I reminded him about the special. He argued that it ended yesterday and I pointed out it was on TV today. I told him I did not want both then and he rolled his eyes.etc. I asked to speak to someone else and then when the female employee came over I explained the situation and she did not apologize but offered for me to keep both blizzards. Was not the point so I declined. The male employee who left to go in the back then peered his head out and kept eyeing me like he wanted a fight. I asked the manager in charge for the phone number of the owner so I could call him. They gave me the owners name , Alan, and a phone # which turns out to be the number of the store and not his phone number that I asked for. Needless to say, when I saw the other reviews on here, I was not surprised and I will also not be back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 You can read the other reviews to understand how the service works (or doesn't work as the case may be..) Let me just give you my highlights: Stood in line for 55 min for a bowl of pasta - you only get a beeper if your ordering pizza - the pasta was very good. But not worth standing in line for 55 min. Went to the bar for a glass of wine - bartender's opening words were NOT ""hi, what can I get you.."" instead: ""When you tip your bartendar, please put the money on the bar and not in the cannister. Tips in the cannister have to be shared with all the employees.."" Seriously. Really. I then got served a warm glass of mediocre wine. Needless to say, no tipping took place. Then had to wait in-line to pay the bill for this miserable experience. Not a manager in sight. No one cared. Me neither - won't go back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This is definitely one of my favorite places downtown. We love live music! In fact, musicians play on a stage above the main bar and behind the beer taps. Sweet set up. There is no set dance floor so expect myself and others to be dancing around your table. Some nights there are some really great bands playing and others have the bands that play the Vegas style top 40 mash ups that I find a little strange. The staff are super friendly and know how to mix a drink. I can always count on Willis to serve my vodkas up right. Not too stiff, not too weak. A great bartender that always adds to our fun time. The location is fantastic. The sister to Stand Up live, across from Lucky Strike, on the second floor of CityScape, so the view on the patio of downtown at night is a winner. I haven't ate here yet, but if the food is the same as they serve at Stand Up Live, it's pretty tasty bar fair. It's a great choice if you're looking for a fun time downtown.

 Yes, it is sublime. Dined here a few times. Outstanding margaritas. The subtle touches one would experience say, sitting in a nice restaurant in Guadalajara, Mexico. Sliced radishes, real cotija cheese, mole, etc. Do yourself a favor while the evenings are nice, bring the special someone or family and dine on the patio. Highly recommend the Quesadillas Mexico City style to start off; nothing like it in town and positively delicious with a cold beer or margarita on the rocks.

 I am a business owner who has been subject to clients whom feel the need to make up stories or trash me on yelp. So when I write this I am writing to tell you about my time at Absolutely Chic Day Spa. Although I was impressed by the size of the place I felt is was a bit of a strange set up. I have to say first impression was I was scared to use the stairs to get to this place. I am sure this owner is getting a great deal on their rent. Or they should be. The sign upon leaving I noticed that it said to use the elevator? HU? The stairs as you get to the top look like they might fall apart. The people I felt were VERY friendly. However, I did not get the service that is listed on their website. I think according to the outline for the service I bought with my groupon a few steps were missing. Now being a business owner I can understand that it might be a little confusing. But they have the steps on the website? The over all massage if you will, was nothing to write home about however, she did give me a nice neck and head massage. while I was wrapped up... I feel like she tried. But it really was not worth the money I paid on my groupon let alone if I would have paid full price. Over all it was just kinda a weird set up and I doubt I will go back. I think they have spent a lot of money on some really nice equipment and furniture but really should think about moving locations and getting some workers who are educated a bit more, and who take pride in the way they look. I understand they are there to work so scrub are more than fine, but she really looked unprofessional with no makeup (your a skin business) and hair just pulled back in a messy pony. As far as the treatment I got. I don't see anything different and I asked if it would take more than just one session I was told no... I see NOTHING. I guess it was worth the short cat nap I took...

 I've wanted to try Burger Bar for a long time now (since Hubert is so awesome!), so I knew I couldn't pass up the opportunity. An added plus is that the restaurant is open until 1 a.m., which makes it one of the few in the area, I believe. It was perfect for us to go try after our show! I had the trio mini sliders which were accompanied with a side of fries. Each burger had its own little spin-- one classic, one with bacon, and one buffalo! Each one was unique enough to stand on its own. Even after finishing all of them, I could still recollect what each one tasted like individually, and that's the whole point, right? All my friends were satisfied with their burgers too. I have to say that the fries were cooked nicely, but they weren't anything special. In the end, it's a three-star because I think one, the burger could have been more juicy, and two, there are other burgers that deliver on the same price and budget. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Very good. I like that I know exactly what to expect when I go. Love the atmosphere of the place and I never really mind waiting for up to 45 minutes to be seated. I've had brunch, dinner, and drinks/cheese curds here. I want to try new places and come here less... but I just end up here all the time especially when there are visitors because I know they won't disappoint. Protocol for me is to put my name down, go to the back bar, drink a beer and hang out, and time flies~ Dinner is served pretty quickly. Food and drink menu is extensive. I've seen ~20 of the food items (I've eaten like.. 5...) and no one was ever disappointed. Their old-fashioned drink is pretty tasty too.. and I'm not that big on old fashioneds usually...

 Went for Sunday brunch. We hadn't been here since the remodel and menu changes. We enjoyed it but it isn't the same as before. I didn't like the look of the buffet: less fruit, no eggs, a little less in the dessert area. On the other hand the entree selection seemed better than before. My wife had buffet only and was glad not to have had an entree. I had the steak and eggs and was happy not to have added the buffet. We were both happy with our food. The ""bottomless"" champagne kept me lubricated. Service was decent: we have had better but the place was busy. Price seemed fair considering food and beverage quality. We will be back. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Stopped in for an early dinner on Saturday evening. I had missed lunch and was starving. I rarely get over to this part of town and it had been well over a year since I had visited. So even though it was only 4:45 PM, I figured I would visit again. So glad I did. Even though it was so early, there were already a few tables filled and the carryout pizza was flying out the door. By the time I left a little after 6:00, the place was pretty full. I was promptly greeted and seated, and quickly attended to by my server Todd. Great guy. Very friendly. His service was stellar. I started with the appetizer special of a large Portobello mushroom cap stuffed with a crab filling and topped with a balsamic reduction and served over a bed of saut \ u00e9ed spinach. Delicious. I followed with a entre special of Osso Bucco (did I spell that right?) with a side of Gnocchi. Again, simply delicious. All in all, a terrific experience. Great food and service, with a comfortable and quaint atmosphere. I'll need to try harder to get over that way more often...... ",0,0,0,0,1

 I really was excited about trying this place out, and I REALLY want to give it more stars, but the experience was just so bad for me. We came in here about a week ago on a Sunday night for a friend's birthday dinner. We had reservations for a party of 40+ people. My friend had planned it, and the dinner guests was comprised of a bunch of his buddies from LA and other cities. The food was okay, but the service is where it kinda lacked for me. First off, our server gave everyone the option to either do a la carte or the prix fixed menu for $75. Sounds good, right? We ordered and the night kept going on... Fortunately, we got our drinks, cuz I REALLY would have been disappointed if I wasn't liquored up lol... My boyfriend and I got the prix fixed menu--it sounded like it was gonna be good. Everyone around us pretty much ordered a la carte; their food came out first, and from then on I regretted ordering the prix fixed deal. After about half an hour of waiting, after watching everyone finish their a la carte meal, small plates of sushi were being delivered to the middle of the tables. I was so confused because I thought I was paying $75 for my own plate, not to share with a bunch of people that just had food. This is something that the server forgot to mention--the prix fixed deal was served ""tapas style."" Had I known that, I would have spent $75 on an a la carte dinner just so I wouldn't have to share. So lame. I was so hungry, and they were only putting out like one plate per 4 or 5 people. I think the server got the point, saw the hungry look on our faces half way through our meal and brought out more food. Only this time it was too late; people were already filling up on the little scraps that were already out (I snacked on so much edamame). It was terrible because there was so much food left over. I felt so bad. I really wish they would have just anticipated to bring out that much food to begin with. Finally, the bill. OMG. IT. TOOK. FOREVER. Literally took an hour to get the bill. I don't know why, but it did. And it was terrible. The server was so overwhelmed. At one point she even said, ""That's it, I give up, I don't know what to do anymore."" Everyone had a separate check, some people had cards, some people had cash, some people ordered a la carte, others ordered the prix fixed, and everyone had different drinks. So I can see how confusing it can easily get. I don't know if it was her first time serving a big party like this, but she really didn't seem to know what she was doing--as pretty as she may have been. Okay, I'm done ranting. Let me share some of the things that I DID like. The ambiance is really pretty. Dim. They've got this sexy Asian decor going on. I dug it. The cocktail/beer/wine menus were on iPads (I still don't get why iPads don't have full menus on them). I tried the lychee sake martini drink. That was tasty. The prix fixed menu wasn't terrible. The rolls were nothing to rave about, but the sashimi dishes were amazing! I'd go back there for some of those! The rock shrimp was also pretty good. Overall, I probably would have given this place 3 or 4 stars. The other staff members were actually pretty attentive (my water glass was always filled to the brim; I was never thirsty for water lol). It's just that one main girl server that had to ruin it for me. *sigh* I'll probably try this place again some other time. The wound is still too fresh for me to go back there anytime soon, however. Some day, I'll give you another chance, Kumi, someday. But until then, 2 stars for you, bro. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is right across the street from me and is decently priced. Last time I ordered there I found a whole entire food service glove inside of my salad. Extremely Gross, I did call and they replaced the order at a later date which was to be expected or I wanted my money back.

 I have a feeling this place has some HUGE fans, and I suppose I can see why. Town Square has become a relatively trendy destination for all kinds of people in Las Vegas. On the surface, a wine and whiskey lounge with a happy hour menu sounds great. However... This place seemed pretty confused to me. There didn't seem to be any real connection to any of the menu items. The decor was clearly expensive, but not attractive. Prices were high (it seemed) on whiskey, and their drink special that day was Wild Turkey, which hardly seems special to me. Waitresses dressed trashy as did the hostesses. I can see how this might have allure in some contexts, but it just seemed out of place here. The music was loud and really bass heavy, which would have seemed appropriate if they had a dance floor - but this is just a tiny little bar. I don't know, maybe I missed something or just didn't ""get it"". I would probably be willing to give it another chance, but I am currently unimpressed with Double Helix. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Chose this place because of the Hilton name. Stayed here for 12 nights so I believe my review should hold some weight! We were given a voucher for 2 bottles of complementary water when we arrived. I told the clerk we were here for 12 days. She said water only provided the first day. For a desert facility, you would think that you would be given 2 per day of stay. Seemed a bit stingy for a 4 star resort. We were taken to to Bldg. 17, one of the farthest buildings from the main lobby and main pools. We were in a handicap accessible suite. First observation, parking is very tight. Parking under building is prohibited. From peeking inside one of these slots, you can see netting attached to the ceiling because the building is crumbling! Outside hallways to back rooms are dark and murky. Had to call for light bulbs to be changed. Room seemed reasonably nice, but then!!! Walk in shower floods entire bathroom. Maintenance had to rip out drain and clean it out, only to find out that the design of the bowed shower curtain was the cause of the flooding. For 10 days, had to prop up shower curtain in front of drain with rolled towels! No shelving except for soap tray for shampoo, etc. Anyone in a wheelchair or severely disabled would be in real trouble. Next, the sink is not in the bathroom!!! You have to go into the bedroom to wash your hands! Very unsanitary. Balcony claustrophobic with a limited view because of the building in front of us. Room was made up in a timely fashion when requested, however, I don't believe the room was vacuumed more than once in 12 days. How do I know this? I had to kill a nasty spider in the popcorn ceiling and the remnants littered the floor for days. I also found a spider in the bed and one lurking on the sheer (dirty) draperies. The paint on the inside window ledges has been painted so many times, it has a life of its own! Towels in room are old and rough. One day we had one that had blue stains all over it. Coffee and tea in room is nice, but no sink to fill machine. Water in refrigerator is $3 a bottle and premium water n counter $6.50. No, thanks! Bought a case of water at Walgreens for 3.99 and lugged it to the room for the duration. Went to the Pointe of Tyme Restaurant for dinner that night. Burger was superb and salmon was delicious. Pleasantly surpised. Breakfast good to if you order off the menu. Breakfast buffet ok. Wait staff very professional and helpful. Internet was good, but we had to change codes 3 times during stay. The pool closest to us had plumbing trucks lined up all week. Went to the large main pool one day. Went into the jacuzzi, but it was broken. The clincher came the last day. Put the Do Not Distrub sign on door and went to breakfast. Check out is 11 AM. Returned at 10:15 AM to find the maid in our room cleaning it out for the next guest!!! We had already taken our luggage to our car, but all of our sundry possessions were still in the room. My husband's kindle was unplugged and in a bag on the housekeeping cart. Our precious water was whisked away and room was in disarray from the cleaning in progress. If we had come a few minutes later, we would have had to track down our things! So in summary, this place, on the surface looks great. The lobby, the entrance grounds, and restaurants are all beautiful. The rooms: Yuk! Service: depends - hot and cold. Pools: All need work. My advice: Wait until after they bulldoze the buildings before staying here! ",0,1,0,0,0

 We were pretty excited for this place for some reason but it turned out to be just meh. We arrived right after it opened and were told to sit anywhere by the hostess, who was also the only waitress there. The booth we chose had a bunch of crumbs on it, which was odd considering we were the first ones there. Guess the night crew doesn't clean? Started with some shakes. The Nutella one was good, salted caramel was just okay. We ordered various burgers off the menu (nothing custom) and a couple side orders of fries. The burgers were good, cooked well. The crab fries were good but the pork belly on the other order seemed dry. There was what seemed to be nacho cheese on the fries which made it kind of soggy and overly salty. The bathroom was filthy. There was poop in the toilet (not the restaurant's fault, I know) hair in the sink and only a few paper towels on the back of the toilet. For being a fairly new restaurant it seemed it like it had an old bowling alley bathroom. We will not likely be back as ReHab Burger is much better, cleaner and closer. ",0,0,1,0,0

 DO NOT GO HERE!!! The manager Alex is horrible & so is the mechanic who worked on our car. No customer service and they're very rude! This place actually receives no stars from me!!!! I waited 2 hours for them to check out what was going on with my headlight & while waiting I noticed that the mechanic would work on other cars. Finally after another half an hour we asked the cashier what was going on and he told us the mechanic was test driving a car, when we could clearly see the mechanic outside so he was lieing! Then we told them we are not paying anything and leaving and they told us we need to wait because they don't know what they disconnected!!!!! Then we asked to see a manager and she kept walking past us and ignoring us!!! When she finally came to us she had the worst attitude ever and just gave us the keys with no sorry or anything!

We stood there waiting to be seated with our group for about another 10 by that time some of our group had finished eating stood up and left so we could sit.

 I made my way to Body Barre after buying a Groupon for ten classes. Those ten classes were enough to tone my arms to their best shape ever. Most of the instructors were fun, nice and professional, with the exception of one. Looking back, I wish I could have avoided Liz Denny's classes and I think I would have enjoyed my experience more. Overall, it's a great workout. You'll definitely get your money's worth. My advice to other newcomers, avoid afternoon and Saturday mid-morning classes. They're generally too crowded to get the best work out possible. Also, If you go during the day, there's a girl who moans really load (sounds like sex noises.) It's not a big deal, but it can break your concentration during tough moves. It's hard to focus when you're laughing and everyone's ignoring the elephant in the room. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I don't get it. I think China Grill is suppose to be exotic dining destination for the Panda Express crowd and fine dining for PF Chang's Bistro followers, but that in itself is another problem. The first clue should have been when I spied sushi on the menu of a restaurant named ""China Grill"", um, China, not Japan, however since the food is categorized as ""Asian fusion"" and after several drive-by's of the Miami Beach location, where it always appears to be hopping, we decided to give the Las Vegas location a try. Overall, it was a very uneventful and boring meal, which consisted of beef dumplings starters, a green salad, which had no hints of Asian spice or flavor and an entree of sliced beef, which tasted no more than grilled beef with soy sauce. Given the outrageous prices charged for all the menu items, of which I would have not have had an issue with if each of the appetizers and entrees had been prepared with more creativity, I think most guests would be better off going to an actual Chinese or Asian food restaurant over this unimaginative restaurant.

""We have your order and we will be 20 min""..... okay I'm thinking,,,,, HUH? what do you mean 20 minutes? 20 minutes till they get the order cooked and done or 20 minutes until you are on my front door? They had all the hotel info, but then informed me that they were not allowed up to the room. I'm worried.... Does this mean that he is downstairs right freeking now???! So I proceed to ask him a series of questions...... ""ARE you downstairs right now???"" , he says ""No, 20 mins"". Im still puzzled. He then says, ""I'm not allowed to come up to your room, only lobby"". I'm thinking....are you in the lobby RIGHT NOW???? He says, ""No, See you in 20 mins"". and I'm thinking ...okay, we have figured out the plan now. Then he says ""I've been waiting 20 mins"". OMG!!!!!!!! Now what?!?!?!!!! Does this mean he has been WAITING downstairs for 20 mins now????! What the hell! Finally we come to an agreement that he is in fact, NOT downstairs and I tell him to call me when he is in the lobby. He then says again, ""See you in lobby"", with a thick accent and very little english. I'm going bat shit now.... I hang up thinking, am I going to see food tonight or not?? He calls in 15 more minutes, ""Kimberley...I in lobby"". then he mumbles something about coming up to my room. I'm thinking ARE YOU COMING TO THE DOOR??? He then states that security won't let him upstairs. Well.... I can get security to bring you upstairs.... He then says, No, security says no..... I'm pulling my hair out by now..... All I had ready was a bathrobe and slippers.... so I went down to the lobby in front of everyone who was checking in..... to get my food. He's sitting there and jumps up right away.... GOOD GUESS...since we have never met before. Seriously, for the $, this food is totally legit. Very authentic and very very tasty. I had the Papaya Salad, which was probably the best I've tasted in years & Red Curry with beef, it was so addictive I wanted to eat the entire tub full but that's way way too much, the chicken satay, it wasn't dry, tasteless at all with the same greasy peanut sauce that everybody uses...it was in fact a cut above. Everything was fresh, the lettuce, the onions, the tomatoes.... everything was recently prepared just for my order and for that they get a GREAT BIG gold star! ",0,0,0,0,1

 My a/c unit was blowing hot air and I knew that I had a problem that needed to be fixed immediately! I read the reviews on Yelp and decided to gives these guys a call. Im so glad I did... Lou was the Tech who diagnosed and fixed the problem with in 2 hours of arriving at my house. He went over all parts and components and made me understand all of my options. Pricing is fair and these guys are in the business for long term! They are trying to build a solid client base using great customer service. These guys are locally owned and operated and I recommend this company to everyone. Great job AC Guys Jeff ",0,0,0,0,1

 I wouldn't go back. They would have gotten 3 stars if the service wasn't so terrible. They would have gotten 2 stars if they hadn't accidentally charged us double. The food is mediocre at best. We had the garlic knots, cheese bread, thick crust pepperoni pizza, and zippolis for dessert. The knots are deep fried and tasteless. The cheese bread was like Papa Johns but not as good. The pizza was a little bit like Dominos. The crust was better but way too much sauce with rosemary sprinkled all over it. The zippolis were good, tasted like powdered doughnuts. The drinks are overpriced with a bad selection. The service was beyond terrible. Forgetting napkins, plates, silverware, drinks. Taking forever to get us these things after asking for them. Not checking back in. Asking for our check then waiting 20 minutes only to have our check screwed up. The atmosphere is pretty weird. Went in to watch a baseball game but no games were on the tv. Really loud old rock/country playing. About 4 regulars playing video poker in the bar but the dining room was pretty busy with families. Tried using the sound box to listen to the game but there was too much static. There is a big plexiglass window separating the bar from the dining room, so you feel like you are on display or in a zoo. ",1,0,0,0,0

 About time Vegas got an old school butcher shop! Well walking at tivoli I noticed echo and rig. The previous day I went to my local grocery store and asked if they could cut me some thin slices of sirloin so I could make cheese steaks. They lacked the equipment so I was out of luck. When I walked up to echo and rigs window the first thing I noticed where the pigs hanging from hooks and then there was rack of lamb and strings of sausages. I knew I had to walk in to check it out. Inside, it's a two story restaurant. Rustic looking but really cool none the less. I went to the butcher counter after looking at all the beautiful meats. I asked if they could shave sirloin for cheese steaks. They said absolutely and brought me out two choice cuts of steak to choose from. I made my selection and it was shaved so beautifully thin. They packaged it and I paid. For those of you who dread cooking at thanksgiving they make thanksgiving dishes and turkeys if you like. Just FYI :) I'll definitely be back for more custom cuts!

 Have been to Global 4 to 5 times now and it is consistently good. Very unassuming location (in an office park off of Johnson Rd. on 485) but they make the best of it. Great service that seems like side jobs for local Johnson & Wales kids (who else would be able to describe the cooking method for each entree that descriptively? Maybe... I don't know). Chef covers many different cuisines, hence the name, but seems to do best with creations of his own (try the pork belly if it is ever on the menu). Worth the trip. Decent to above average wine list.

 This is a great place to take the kids to keep them busy and work out some of antst in their pants. We come here quite often and the kids always enjoy it. There are lots of different areas for kids of varying age groups, so everyone is sure to have a good time. We love Groupon too because they regularly have vouchers available which slashes the price in half. The couches aren't very comfortable for adults who are watching their kids, but they do have internet and a reasonable cafe for snacks and beverages. I hear they do a nice job with kid parties too. I would just recommend staying away from the dodgeball area when there are teens or man-children around who are not paying attention to the littler kids... ",0,0,0,1,0

 Great memoribilia but average food. The quality of the filet mignon was very good, however all three steaks in our party were cooked incorrectly and had very little flavor. The double baked potato was dry and bland. The ribs were pretty good, salad was ok, and onion string appetizer was ok as well. Got to say I am pretty disappointed overall. During spring training get a reservation even on Mondays. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Camelback Mountain is not for the novice hiker. The terrain is steep, rocky, and challenging. In truth, I made it only three quarters of the way up. The last portion is practically a straight vertical. The up is great but I can imagine that I'd start loosing feeling in my fingers on the way down - I have a severe fear of heights. The views are spectacular and worth the sweat pouring down my face. I also need to give a shout out to the Rangers - they are ridiculously nice and helpful. I would not have made it down without their guidance. By the way, they informed me that they need to do a rescue nearly everyday and the people who are running down the hills are those who usually get into the most serious accidents. So there. Pbbbt. Next I attempt the summit, I'll be bringing at least a quart of water, a hiking stick, and a camera. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We came for lunch while waiting for check in. We are trying out a vegan diet and our waitress was extremely accommodating. We got the Fajitas and the Black Bean Burger and she made sure they removed all hidden butter/cheese/etc. The meals were good: nothing too fancy - delicious pub food. It's expensive, but it's Vegas so that's not surprising. We came a second time around 1 am on a weeknight and were surprised to see that they still served food. Get the fries! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Fantastic food, fantastic staff, and fantastic decor. I was really surprised when we walked in and there was no one there but us the whole time, but...we were there around 3:30 for a late lunch/early dinner, and they were setting up for two big parties. We sat down and took in the very cozy decor, all antiques which I am in love with. Our waiter was great, as well as another employee who came by and apologized for the noise (which none of really noticed) as they were setting up tables for the parties that were coming in later on in the evening. Two of us started off with a Samuel Smith Organic Cider, and Hummus with warm Pita bread, which was great. I ended up getting the Penne Gorgonzola...what sold me on my choice? In the description it said...'Blue Cheese lovers unit' Hands down possibly the best pasta I've gotten from a restaurant ever. Tasted very authentic, and very fresh. We ended our meal by splitting the Pumpkin Cheesecake...to die for, really. Everything I ate here, and experience at Bunky's is all hands down great. Can't wait to stop in again. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Saturday dinner for four, reservations booked about 5 days ahead. The place was still bustling when we left around ~12:15am. We were shown directly to our table when we arrived, with the waiter removing a ""Reserved"" sign from a table near the front windows of the restaurant. Ah, a good signal. Service was snappy and on point, keeping everybody happy while not being over-obtrusive. We felt like we got a little attitude at the start (being four American males in their mid-20s), but the service warmed up quickly. Recommendations were excellent and the waiters were knowledgeable about both the dishes and the drinks. For appetizers, we had the rillette, chicken liver mousse, ouefs in mayonnaise, and a good cheese salad. As a devotee of salty meat and fat, I got down mainly on the rillette and the mousse. The rillette was rustic and flavorful, with a chopped texture that had just enough creaminess to allow you to spread it over toast. A rich, gamey pork. The mousse was probably the highlight of the meal; one of the best dishes I've had in a long time. An ethereal, fluffy emulsion of savagely herbacious fat. God, I love it. I did not sample the other dishes since we had a vegetarian with us, and I did not want to eat his appetizers, but he had nothing but good things to say. I will also point out that they were very accommodating, making many suggestions to him. Dinner was the duck confit over a salade verte. While the duck was spectacular, with wonderful contrasts between the creamy meat and crispy edges, I was most surprised by the greens. Fresh, flavorful, high-quality greens can bring a salad into another stratosphere. These slightly bitter, crispy greens, dressed lightly in duck fat, were perfect. We had the creme caramel and maple syrup tart for dessert. The creme caramel was mediocre, with a kind of flabby quality. Not much flavor in the sauce, either. The tart was delicious, but I thought the crust was a bit dry and crumbly. Dinner for four with three courses, two bottles of wine, digestifs, taxes, and tip was $270. A fantastic meal. Well-executed, classic bistro fare served with no frills or attitude, with great service. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This is probably some of the best pizza in Las Vegas. If you are looking for New York-style, pan crust or Sicilian, then this place is not for you. You'll be getting the real-deal kind of pizza, as it is served in Naples. The insalata is simple and satisfying. I usually stick to the margherita pizza, as it never disappoints. My boyfriend loves the arancini as well. This location is quite larger than its Henderson counterpart, and the furniture and tables (including lighting and bar) are equal parts rustic and gorgeous. The only drawback to this location (as opposed to one in Henderson) is that they don't serve gelato. Other than that, it's not far from my house and I don't have to go to all the way to Henderson when I'm jonesin' for Settebello anymore. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I'm not a chocoholic, but when I am in the mood for some, I only want the good stuff. Jinju certainly offers the good stuff. I was meeting my friend for a dinner to celebrate her birthday, so I stopped by Jinju ahead of time to pick her up a birthday gift. I opted for a prepackaged assortment for her and couldn't resist a few little treats for me as well. Everything was decadent and deliciously smooth. I was impressed with the ice packs that they provided so my chocolates wouldn't melt in the summer heat.

 Finally! We found the place (opposite side of the Strip, not Henderson) that reminds us of home the most! This place has been around for over a year or so now, opened by a Big Island guy! So, you'd better expect BIG! Expect to bring home some leftovers for dinner/lunch/breakfast the next day! Every time we come here, we feel like we're back at home again! For some reason, food (and music) will always take us back to the islands... *smack!* the Chicken Katsu Loco Moco! First time ever trying both local favorites - together! MmmMmmm! Aaaand, leftovers to take home! OHH! And you should try their Fried Rice and Omelet! I think it's on their Specials Menu! That fried rice is soooo tasty, with huge pieces of sausage in it, and so very moist and perfect! They serve it with 3 slices of Portuguese sausage, I think it's the Maui or Big Island kine! HUGE! And ONO, too! Other goodies to try, Korean Chicken (saucy!), and their Kalbi! If you are from Hawaii, and you live here in Las Vegas now, forget about L&L for your local fix!

 Awesome food! I've been in love with Bosnian food since 2008 when I visited the country, and I was not disappointed at all. It's definitely an immigrant restaurant and any non-Bosnians might feel a but strange at first, but the waiter is super friendly and very welcoming. Definitely check this place out if you are in the mood for something authentic. And for all you posters out that made comments about not finding Bosnian products or authentic restaurants in NY or LA, that's because you aren't looking in the right city. St. Louis is home to the largest population of bosnians outside of Bosnia. Checkout the Bevo Mill area for a large selection of Bosnian restauarants and markets. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I joined this gym in January with my fianc \ u00e9. It was crowded but everyone expects that when you join a gym in January! It was a great experience then. The cardio cinema is really great. I wanted to do my review after about 5 months to get the full picture. Well the place is now so overcrowded with people just standing around and the people there are what people warn you about with North Las Vegas. Not comfortable at all coming except to go to a class and leave. I would not go there just to work alone any more. Also, there really needs to be a timer for the movies because on more than one occasion I had to actually call the front desk to ask for someone to come and restart the movie!!

 It's the only place you can get decent boba (in Arizona). The food is pretty good and the service is usually okay unless one lady is working. The service was much better before a couple of girls left in the summer. The people who they think was the manager isn't the manager (but she thinks she is). She's a real b. I don't know why Amy, the owner, even keeps her. At any rate - when she is working, I refuse to go there. I will literally walk on by! :D ",0,1,0,0,0

 Sorry, but after coming back a few times, our experiences get worse and worse that 2 star bump down is fair. Firstly,today there were flies. A lot of them bothering our food and we're trying to eat while waving them away. I eat with a bowl of rice in one hand and chopsticks in another- I don't have a spare hand to keep waving so I look like an idiot waving my rice bowl about. Take care of that shit because that's annoying and unappetizing. The UYE we got fairly decent service, but maybe it was a fluke or they knew we were reviewers so they tried to be on their best. When I came with my BF, we had to flag down for everything even though theres only 2 tables. Next two times with family, sometimes flags were ignored and we were held hostages waiting for the check and to-go boxes. The servers always look angry and don't seem very happy doing their job. They don't seem to be pleased when we ask for anything so I try to order everything at once, but that doesn't make a difference because they ignore you asked for things and only bring out items you paid for and not the condiments, or water or tea. Refill request and simple things like asking for condiments or water was ignored even when asked repeatedly. We also were given forks only and also had been skipped in being given hot tea before...I'm assuming they think it's not for white people (Asian clientele had tea and chopsticks without asking). Other Chinese restaurants when in doubt usually ask. It seems that dinner/bigger spenders ordering the lobster specials and such are the friends that have gotten decent service so it probably is because they only care when you spend a lot. That's not how to run a resto- treat me nice when I have a big ticket, and then ignore me when I come for a lunch special. People talk and nothing is more loud than unhappy customers. Food that we get is good, but I don't think it's fantastic enough to say that it can overcome the pisspoor service and attitude. I'm going back to Food Express and Joyful House for Chinese/late night and lunch across the street at Wendy's Noodle Cafe. Wendy's is not only fantastic service, it's so pleasant that their smiles can cure a bad day. They're just as good food-wise and the three of them have actual service. My family is nice and still gave our standard 20% tip. I had half a mind to yank that off the tray and put it back in grandmas wallet. I rarely have felt we shouldn't tip at all....I normally leave a little bit, but I should've got their tip and bought myself dessert at Wendy's Noodle Cafe. I doubt that I will be going back here. If I do it's because someone insisted and I had enough notice to bring an obnoxious big neon foam ""sports"" hand to wave for service. ",0,1,0,0,0

 MY 100th REVIEW! I'm completely addicted to dumplings right now after having a whole bag of Ling Ling dumplings from Costco for every meal for two weeks... But Fat Dumpling is what started the addiction... What Fat Dumpling has going for them is that they don't try to be too much. Most of the menu is dominated by the standard style dumplings. You can tell by the taste that these are made in house, and I'm further convinced by how they treat their smoothies. The first time we went, we were told that the tapioca pearls weren't ready yet (it was around 11 in the morning), and that it would be close to an hour. A little disappointing that they aren't made ahead of time, but considering that some pearls take almost two hours to make, it isn't too surprising. In fact, they do let you have yesterday's pearls if you want, or there's some yummy jelly options. But what convinced me to keep coming back here for their smoothies was that they use fresh fruits and not some substitute like powder or syrup. The prices are reasonable, and the mango smoothie is one of the best I've had and isn't overly sweet as well. Usually I get a large and it's gone by the time I get home :| Then there's the dumplings - I thought the flavor was good. No sauce is needed here, though you can always have some if you like. I've also tried their popcorn chicken which has a good flavor but might be a tad salty. On the very plus side, the chicken was very moist and had a good amount of meat. I also tried their steamed pork dumplings which had a good flavor in my opinion. Overall, I simply just enjoy the simplicity, price point, and flavors they offer here. It is probably my favorite local Chinese joint in Las Vegas. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This is one of those places you really have to visit if you're in from out of town. It just captures the flavor of the local culture beautifully. I had the cheesesteak which is uniquely adorned with fried and coleslaw to become a ""Pittsburger"". The sandwich itself isn't all that exciting, but it is good, and it's grilled up right in front of you. My buddy had the ragin' cajun chicken sandwich which was not as spicy as advertised, but he did report that it was good. Wash it down with a Yuengling, and life is good. It's ain't fancy, the service could hardly be called friendly, but it's one of those local joints you really have to see and taste for yourself. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Holy mother of Pearl! Where have you been all my life, True Rest? I was taken here by a friend as ""payment"" for house sitting for him a few weeks ago. Honestly, I thought the whole idea of floating in a saltwater bath was pretty hokey (this guy tends to be a little out there, if you're catching what I'm throwing) so I didn't expect to have a life-altering experience. Much to my surprise, I was completely amazed. After an orientation, completing a form (which included a notice of a $500 fee if you defecated in the water!) and watching a short video, I was off to my private room to shower and soak. The silent and dark, with the lid closed, option sounded like the best way to fully immerse myself into this experience. Here's what I discovered: We all float down here, including me; weightlessness feels great and relaxing; I carry a LOT of tension between my shoulder blades; this water burns your eyes; after 48 minutes in this environment, I become anxious; I'll be going back again. My friend Keith said I'd probably sleep better than ever that night, which wasn't the case. While my body was completely relaxed, my mind was fully ignited. I could probably have invented Post-Its if I focused on that. But I did remain physically at peace for several days thereafter. The Noob-Kit all first-timers receive includes a packet of Epsom salt so you can attempt to recreate the experience at home (I haven't tried this yet). True Rest offers packages for monthly floats.

 This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays. The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event. Why two stars, you ask? There are major issues with this place that test your patience. First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday). There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line. As it turns out, the first line is the ""membership line"" - everyone needs a $5 membership. The second line, is to ""check in"" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor. Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks. The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier. After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of time we spent waiting around to check in. After all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited. Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it. Then, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess. We head to our bay with a ""bay concierge"" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play. Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works. We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up. He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a ""slider"" was. (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying). We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf. Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about. ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal. When the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, ""do you know one thing thats missing in this place?"" The server leaned in all interested.... ""napkins - there are no napkins on the table"". Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins. He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, ""could we have napkins?"" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times. So, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?). The refill of chips took about 20 minutes. We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good. The kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc. He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing. He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes. OK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing. The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated. If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off. Again, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I love Floor & Decor! I first found out about it while remodeling a condo in California and fell in love with the place. When I found out we were getting one here in Vegas I was excited! Needing to get materials to redo the floor in a kitchen and front entry way I knew Floor & Decor would be the first place to look. Upon entering it is an open and spacious. I was greeted as well the people I was with by the cashiers. I have to warn you that it can take a while to make a decision because they have isles and isles of options. We found 6 that were our favorite and had to keep narrowing it down until we found the perfect one. Usually it seems it is hard to find just one that you like. The prices are really good. None of the ads or even the website do the store justice you just have to come in and see for your self if you have a project in mind and at least check it out. The store is clean and there are plenty of employees in eyesight if you have any questions. I did notice this location said it was an outlet on a sign as I walked in. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Sushi in Surprise? Woohoo! My husband and I were just here on Saturday and discovered their lunch special: $1 (per piece) select nigiri and select rolls 3 for $11.95. Their special rolls are reasonably priced as well, ranging from $7.95 to $12.00. The fish was very fresh, not fishy at all, and the avocadoes didn't have a spec of brown on them. The albacore tuna nigiri was probably my favorite, definitely worth trying. There wasn't one that i didn't like! The ambiance of the restaurant is nothing to rave about. They have 1 TV that didn't seem to be working (they were trying to set it up for the Cardinals playoff game). Service was ok, although it did take a decent amount of time to get the dishes out. I didn't really mind though because the food was good. By about 1:30 the place had filled up! I can't imagine how it is at dinner time. I really liked this place and would definitely go back.

 The Egg & I is a Johnny-Come-Lately, New-Kid-in-Town version of Denny's or Perkins. I get their MO: Serve up the same kind of stuff and dress it up with a cute name to draw the upscale brunch crowd. Voila, it works masterfully -- you get a crowded place with a long wait for service and if you're really unlucky, like us, an even more Egg-&-I-zingly long wait for your food. My family and I sat for 1 hour, 47 minutes waiting for our order. Kid you not. I know this because I received a text message just before placing our order and the time stamp never lies. The waiter and manager compensated us not with a free entree or a comped check, but with one free cinnamon roll to split among the four of us and free refills of nasty diner coffee while we waited. Gracious. Since it pains me to write reviews like this, I will say the food was OK when we finally got it. Then again, after waiting almost 2 hours, we devoured it like the pack of hangry wolves we were. The eggs could have been rotten and we'd have been none the wiser but honestly, and to be fair, everything tasted A-OK. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is the best Paradise bakery in the valley due to the inclusion of Panera items. If you're from back east you will love having access to your Panera favorites. It has the best of both worlds with the great Panera bagels, best entrees from both restaurants, and cookies from Paradise. You will not be sorry you chose to eat here. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I have been going to Taquitos Jalisco for several years. I have introduced my friends and family to them and we all love it.

 Being the only Ethiopian restaurant in town, you really don't have a choice but go here if you're in the mood for Ethiopian. The spongey bread wasn't what made this a three for me, it was the serving sizes and the somewhat blandish dishes. The service was also pretty slow, but pleasant enough. I got the lamb entree with the two sides and I don't even remember exactly what they tasted like. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We ate here the day after Thanksgiving. I can't give this place a better review other than 2 stars cause it was pretty bad. We were seated fairly quickly and given a table right under a vent. Instead of blowing out warm air it felt like the A \ \ C instead. We noticed all the other people were seated at the opposite side of the room close to a fireplace. How odd we get seated over here instead. Even with coats on and hat with gloves we were freezing. We asked the hostess if we could move closer to the fireplace. She did move us but it took like 15 minutes and there were many open tables.The waitress took our order and it took forever. We ordered appetizer and a salad. It took 35 minutes to get them. We noticed other tables had bread and butter on their tables yet we never were offered any. The waitress was apparently so busy with the only 4 other tables in there we couldn't even get her attention. We ordered a burger and philly steak and the meat was so burnt on both it was black. My sister ordered salmon and the rice was mush. The turkey wrap had cheap quality turkey luncheon meat. She forgot the coleslaw my friend ordered. So I dont want to be totally mean to the waitress as she was the only server in the whole restaurant. But the odd thing was we saw like 3 bussers walking around and talking. They were occasionally filling water glasses and that was it. So not one of them could have helped the waitress? Though the experience was not a pleasant one, I still tipped the waitress 15 percent and my friend who manages restaurants for a living gave her 20 percent. He said though the service was not great he didn't know if she was just having a bad night and it was also due to the the restaurant and hotel having bad management. We didn't want to make her night any worse. Sadly, we will not be staying at this hotel or eating at this restaurant again. We stayed at the more expensive Lodge cabins and it was definitely better there. I guess you get what you pay for. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Aria is by far the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. here are some reasons why: - took an hour to check in - booked a room with double queen, but was told its not available and was instead given a king with a roll in - carpet in the room was stained with white spots all over - vent above toilet in the bathroom was not closed, exposing all kinds of pipes and etc. - remote to control entire room does not work - 45 minutes to reach the front desk - spoke to the manager and was upgraded to a ""sky suite"". waited another 1+ hour to get set up in our new ""sky suite"" - ""sky suite"" room turns out to be the same size as our regular room, just a farther walk from the elevator in another tower. - was told keys were transferred over - keys didn't work, got new keys. second set of keys didn't work. - ended up with 12 keys that didn't work. locked out of room in the middle of the night - employees don't know where anything is and don't try to figure it out. instead they just say ""sorry i don't even know..."" instead of ""i don't know but let me find out for you"" - horrible service at cafe, we asked to move one table over because we had 1 person joining us at a 4 person table and they denied us because that section was ""closed"" even though the table was 2 ft away. i do understand that they are new but at least train your employees to know the layout of the casino before you open? also to the guy complaining about no DVR, i don't know which hotels you've stayed at but i've never seen hotels with DVR. also the entrance to the crystals mall is 10 ft away from the aria door so its not that far of a walk in crazy weather conditions.. the remote in the room is very straight forward, the person saying it takes a tech genius to operate it is obviously just complaining to complain.

 Came here with my family for breakfast since it was one of the few restaurants that were open around 8-9 AM. The food was an ultimate disappointment for how overpriced it is. $10.95 for plain french toast with 2 pieces of bacon that is burned and a tiny slice of an orange. As much as I soaked it with maple syrup, the french toast was too stale. $7.95 for a gross omelette and a tiny piece of steak that is not tender. I guess that's what you get for it being $7.95. The pancakes were just pancakes. Nothing special about this place. We waited 25 minutes for food that wasn't worth recommending. You won't see me coming back for breakfast. Our waitress was nice though! Thats probably the only pro for this place. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This restaurant is a let down to the Mint Hill area. As soon as you walk in the door the lack of customer service is apparent, when you get seated good luck with your server I have had 3 and only one was not inattentive.

 Skipped breakfast and went here for lunch very hungry. We had a short wait but it was worth it. One of the best burgers that I have ever had. It was cooked perfectly and all of the toppings were on the side, so I could add as much or as little as I wanted. I choose the Ridgefield beef cooked medium topped with pepperjack chese, caramelized onions, guacamole, and jalapeno bacon. Everything was so tasty and the bacon was perfectly crispy. My husband and I split sweet potato fries and the fried pickles. Next time I would skip the fried pickles just because they were so big and there were so many of them. My husband also ordered the Twinkie Milkshake. It was huge and tasty. Service was fast and efficient during lunchtime. While we were there we saw a bunch of UFC fighters eating burgers. Pretty cool!

 I would like to give Grimaldi's higher praise, but it just wasn't as good as I had hoped. I knew of their reputation long ago, since I occasionally have business in NYC, but never made it to the original restaurant. Plus, you can find good pizza on pretty much any corner in the city, so there's no need to make a special trip. The service here was lovely, but the food was so average that I don't really know what to say. We had a salad, which was decent, and a cheese pizza that was also decent. The coal oven does give it a unique flavor, but it wasn't my thing. Again and again I say, Pino's is the best pizza in town, and everything else just disappoints me. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Not bad coffee- but the little 'chef' guy needs to learn some manners and respect. I get that you're enthused about your store, but when I mentioned I'm a regular at the roastery in the same mall and was checking this place out, he sighed and said ""yeah, they aren't very good"". Lesson number 1, don't ever do that. Bad etiquette and poor taste, followed by watching him interrupt our ordering- flirting with the counter girl and causing her to take almost 10 mins for a latte when place was empty- I will not be returning. 2 stars for patio and a good product- hopefully they can learn some better service, as the roastery has them at this point big time.

 I have lived at Grigio Tempe Town Lake for almost two years now and up until about 3 months ago, I absolutely loved it. I live in one of the executive suites by the lake and pay almost $1800 per month for a studio. When I moved in, I was very clearly told that it was a quiet community and most of my neighbors were older executives. Being a business owner who works long hours, this is very important to me. Up until 3 months ago everything was great. About 3 months ago a couple of the apartments below me were rented out to college students, and the neighborhood has quickly gone to hell. These kids have huge parties 3-4 times per week, they play drinking games (beer pong) on their patio until 4:00am regularly, smoke marijuana, and have no respect for the neighbors. At the beginning I would get out of bed, walk down there and ask them to move it inside. They would be quiet for about 20 minutes then start right back up. I am forced to call security in the mid hours of the morning 3-4 times per week, sometimes they show up and sometimes they don't. My other neighbors are just as exhausted as I am, and collectively we complain to management on a weekly basis. From what I can see, nothing is being done to correct the issue as the partying is getting worse and worse. My neighbors and I have now resorted to calling the police when this happens so we will see if that helps the problem. I understand that Tempe is a ""college town"" but if they are going to allow this place to turn into a dorm room, their prices should reflect such. I am exhausted and extremely frustrated with management's lack of action in correcting this issue. At this point, I do not recommend living here unless you are a college student who doesn't mind staying up until 4:00am most nights ",1,0,0,0,0

 Two words I don't like to see in the same sentence are Sushi and Fever ... that is unless I'm going to eat at Sushi Fever. This is definitely a ""locals"" place and a hidden gem in Las Vegas for sushi. I usually start off by getting a screaming orgasms. The combination of seared tuna along with the chef's secret sauce is enough to give anyone a screaming O. I've ordered it a dozen times and am never disappointed ... I do wish the servers would actually call it by it's full name and not the screaming O. As for the sushi, it really is all good. Pick your favorite meat and rest assure you're going to get something good. From the X-Wife to the Carrot Top you're bond to find something you like and won't be able to find anywhere else.

 In sum, if you have been living under a rock or are new to the 'burgh then you may not know that this place has the most amazing Burnt Almond Torte. I can't say much for their other treats as I have partaken in few. However, the Burnt Almond Torte will not disappoint..unless you do not have a palate. I keep the logic with food simple- if a place is ""famous"" for serving a specific item then try it. In this instance, the Burnt Almond Torte is a heaven sent delight. The two layers of moist light yellow cake suspended creamy rich custard, covered in lightly sweetened and fluffy pastry cream with an outer layer crusted with toasted sweet glistening almonds. I am thankful I did not discover this dessert until I was married. I would have easily polished off this cake after a rough exam or breakup. Fortunately, my husband can share the caloric intake with me. Then again, for those with more self-control they offer a significantly smaller ration in the petit four style presentation. I have also had the pleasure of tasting this version which did not disappoint. Now for some other items on the shelves. ..the brownies look much more appetizing than they are in reality. The chocolate lacks richness and depth and the batter is drowning in nuts. It is one thing to highlight a brownie in nuts, it is another to forget you are even eating something other than chopped nuts. I've also had a few of their cookies. Hrmp. Nothing bad but nothing good that was memorable either. I say stick with the torte. Also, I must note that the wedding cake tasting is a complete disaster. No worries, I did not deduct points as I might have caught them on a bad day and I did not try the cake. Whilst still engaged two years ago...Prantl's was my top choice until I arrived for the tasting. Imagine many brides in such a small area and limited staff to assist- provided a cow-herd atmosphere to the tasting. Not my thing- I walked in and walked right back out. I am sure their wedding cakes are amazing yet many places also provide spectacular cakes [hint hint Kribel's bakery is where I got my affordable and tasty gem of a cake] minus the cow herd =) ",0,0,0,1,0

 Love the food here! I think they have the best fried rice ever, and love that the vegetables and meat are large pieces and not chopped into teeny pieces. I almost always get the Mussaman Curry and it's some of the best I've ever had. My second favorite is the sizzling beef, although last time I had carry out the meat was tough and way overcooked. They handle special orders with no problem, although every addition costs $$. They used to run a spice scale of 1-10 with 5 being comparable to jalapenos, but have since changed it to a 1-5 scale with 3 being the old 5. My biggest complaint here is that twice now they've reversed the spiciness of the dishes ordered. Once when I ate in my curry had no spice and my friends had so much spice she couldn't eat it. Of course they fixed the problem for us right away. The second time it happened was a carry-out order and it was too much of a hassle to return for the correct items. Can't see why this should be so difficult to get right. They have a discount card of sorts, accumulate points based on dollars spent and then earn $10 off a purchase. I also recently received a 20% email for being in their ""loyalty program for a year"". I'll be back soon! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I think any opportunity to learn more about the Native American story is a great opportunity that should be taken advantage of. In terms of content, you will definitely be able to walk away with a better understanding of Native American history, culture, different ethnic groups/tribes, migration, and education. I appreciated the level of detail, references, and artifacts throughout the museum. The museum has a wealth of info...both historical and contemporary. However, all tribes arent represented equally throughout the museum, which is cool but it will be helpful to understand why. There are also several interactive games throughout the museum to engage in. In terms of layout, I thought the museum did not have a good flow or at least it was a little difficult to understand the flow. While touring the museum, I often wondered ""where do I go next"" or ""what's the premise of this section"". But that shouldn't stop you from visiting this great facility. They have free admission on Sundays in July which will get you into every part of the museum except for the Lego exhibit. Check it out! ",0,0,1,0,0

 ""What do you do for recreation?"" ""Oh, the usual. I bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback."" I do not actually like bowling. It's my nature. I only like things that i am good at and I am not even certain I would like to be good at bowling so I had my reservations when being invited to hang with the Optimism Club kids but I love these kids so... ""Fuck it, Dude, let's go bowling."" I do have to admit; I really had a blast here. It is vintage and scummy on the outside which to me is just a bowling alley being honest with itself. It looks so old and dingy from the outside that you are slightly taken aback by the automatic doors. It's a bit like you have never seen one before and wow isn't technology amazing? I have to say the bar service was a little slow. They rotated between three bartenders and 2/3 of them were ok so I will let it slide. The third on the other hand was probably better suited for my cube-monkey, paper-pushing job. The beers were however $2 for a domestic in a red dixie cup. It reminded me of the days I could get a red dixie cup foe $2 with free refills all night. Ahh college days... We were here for cosmic bowling. It was somewhere around $12. I hadn't bowled in probably 5 or 6 years and I am pretty sure I paid twice that then. Great prices. The DJ was spinning some pretty excellent tunes (hard drives spin so I can still say ""spin"" right?) My favorite part of the evening went something like this. Me: ""This DJ is playing some pretty decent stuff, but I think he has re-played a few songs since we've been here. Kinof lame."" Friend: ""That's Cedric Ceballos."" Me: ""What's Cedric Ceballos?""

 $10 for a sandwich and a bottle of water is slightly higher that what I was to expect from a food cart; especially if you've been to Portland and have seen their pricing and tasted the quality. The first sandwich I had was absolute crap; the beef was dry and the micro greens didn't go with the sandwich. However, weeks later I tried their ""GreenBay"", which had a scant amount of ingredients, but tasted pretty good. The fact that it came with waffle fries brought my rating from a two-star to a three. In general, they should be buying and making fresh food; I simply couldn't taste the freshness! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Well, it's a lot of show but if you know anything about whisky then you'll see that this is totally for the tourists. Situated outside Edinburgh Castle, it's an opportunity to take a ride in a very slow barrel being whisked along by a ghostly moustache. They offer you a small dram of not particularly good whisky on the silver tour, and four on the gold tour, then you can see the biggest crime known to man - a whole load of whisky that's been collected and not drunk, left to evaporate over the decades!

 I really wanted to like this salon! It's close to my house and opens very early. Even recommended by a friend (although with reservation, as she wasn't happy with her hair that day). I had a cut, all-over color and blow dry. Unfortunately I ended up with a bad trifecta - bangs cut too short (isn't this the first thing they teach?), color that washed out and didn't match, and a style that I can't work with despite 2 weeks of trying. The owner, Anthony, and his asst were very friendly, but I think his style of working on several clients simultaneously leads to error and a lack of focus. He is an expert blow-dryer, and was able to compensate for the cut that day, (with the exception of the bangs), but I washed it 2 days later only to see that the color washed to gold and didn't stay brown, and I never could style it. In addition, despite a sidewalk sign offering a deal for new clients, I wasn't offered the discount (& paid $100). It's too bad, really. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Hanging out in Vegas is only expensive if you do it wrong- classic symptoms of ""doing it wrong"" include: 1. Booking a hotel on the Strip 2. Paying for well drinks in a casino 3. Only eating at sit-down restaurants 4. Paying for parking. I've made seeking out free parking a game, and it's wonderful how much money you save/ few more miles of exercise you get per week! The Market helps out with Numbah 3, and it does it well. The price for the per-pound salad and prepared food bar was 7.99 when I visited, fresh fruit was perfectly ripe, and the customer service was wonderful. They could improve their produce selection- no limes or lemons for hacking into serviceable wedges with whatever blunt instrument one finds in the hotel room. I liked the mini pecan tart, but their cannoli filling was not so great. Will definitely come back next time I'm in the neighborhood! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Honest, helpful, and wonderfully friendly. I am EXTREMELY picky when it comes to my pet's health care; these guys fit the demands perfectly. With a healthy range of practical experience and the new guys who are smart on the latest technology, Grand Montecito Animal Hospital is the place to go! My pup, Kirin, sees Dr Bivens and Dr Blue. Both are incredibly knowledgeable and approachable. I never feel intimidated or 'talked down to"" here as I have felt at other Hospitals. They take great pride and care in giving your pet the BEST treatment possible. Dr. Lewis' knowledge base is invaluable! Dr. Blue and Bivens worked together to give Kirin the best options for her needs and did a wonderful job at fixing her entropion. I am so pleased with their skill and care. The office is always friendly and accommodating. Minette, Katie, and Gaby are always there with a great smile and kind words.

 This place is a waste of time and money. Literally they wasted 3 hours of our night. Thank goodness we made up for it with friendly conversation with ourselves. The portions the five for the sharing plates and flatbreads are enough for one, however for 28 dollars you would think the Waygu Beef short ribs would be bigger than two measly squared pieces. The flavor and texture was good, but when I spend that much I want more than 4 oz of meat. The pasta dish was I'd guess a half cup for 24. Again not worth it. The biggest problem was the way they handle business. They told us they could get us right in on a Saturday night but needed to bus the table. It took 20 minutes to bus the table. After 8 of us were done eating, they finally brought out our entrees (beef and pasta) for those who ordered it; we felt the need to share our discontent with the server who then got the manager. Rather than the manager being cordial he was a straight up pompous douche. He spent 20 minutes giving us excuses as to why they took 3 hours and how it is standard operating procedure. Do not go here. Nothing would make me happier than to see something else in its place the next time I am at the Red Rock. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This Goodwill is my 2nd favorite in the Charlotte area for overall deals and selection. In my humble opinion, this store seems to be the largest Goodwill in Charlotte, unless you count that ramshackle Goodwill store on Freedom Dr. *shudder* Few people would drive to Albemarle Rd. to visit a thrift shop because its, well East Charlotte. But after shopping at other Goodwills, I've been pleasantly surprised with the selection of appliances, furniture, books, and clothes. They have a good selection of furniture and its normally salvageable and microwaves for $10-$15. The book section is actually larger that most thrifts stores. You'll find alot of fluff (read:Danielle Steel, James Patterson), but you can find some real treasures as well. They seem to get alot of overstock books at this location. The men's clothes are decent. I've found nice sports coats and shirts that are slightly worn, but not necessarily threadbare. The clothing is not as good as the Matthews Plantation Goodwill, but don't dismiss the clothing completely. Customer service is predictably unpredictable, but oh well. If you're looking to furnish an apartment with little $$$, find a pelvic thrust exercise machine, or get some sensible threads, this Goodwill is a good bet. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I, too, decided on MCN based on Yelp reviews after moving to Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, I did not have the great experience others did. I ended up getting probably the worst haircut I'd had in 10 years. It ended up a good 4 inches shorter than I discussed with the stylist. In addition, she took the fact that I work in a professional office to mean that I wanted an ugly, boring, mom-ish haircut. It's taken almost a year to grow back to the length it was before. I admittedly should have complained then and there, but I'm a wuss. Additionally, the experience at the salon left much to be desired. I went in the late morning on a weekday. There was a little girl there (around 3 or 4) with her nanny. Apparently her mom was a regular customer. The little girl was getting a haircut and she cried and screamed for 25 minutes. I know kids will be kids, and I don't blame the little girl for being scared or cranky. I do blame the salon for not finding a way for the girl not to disrupt the entire salon - taking her to a back room, taking her outside to calm down, not allowing children in an adult, supposedly high-end salon, etc. Something that was supposed to be a treat for me turned into a headache. I will not be back here, but it seems like others had great experiences. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm not a fan of fast food, i RARELY eat fast food, but since i work nearby i started coming here one time i didn't have lunch from home. Let me just say that one particular lady who works here is the SOLE reason why i ever come back. this lady always greets me with a smile and is overall and agreeable person to interact with. i feel like a VIP when i come and its all because of the wonderful service she provides. No one ever gives me annoyed looks when i bring coupons, (which i do a lot) as i have received at other locations. I am very pleased with this burger king, it has opened my eyes to the world of fast food. after all the makers of salad wraps cant be all wrong :) ",0,0,0,0,1

 It's Saturday and we decided to go to Great Wall for dim sum. I had heard about this place from my cousin, but didn't have a chance to try it until today. We got a late start and by the time we got to Great Wall it was close to 1 pm. The place is fairly spacious and we were seated right away. We noticed that they had a live fish tank with lobster, dungeness crab, assorted fish and even shrimp. The bustling dim sum carts came to us pretty quickly. We tried the following items: Steamed spareribs- small cubes of spareribs steamed in a black bean sauce. It was actually pretty tasty and not super fatty like some places. Would order this again. Long noodle (churng fun) with shrimp- the noodles were too thick for my liking even though the shrimp was nice and crunchy and it had a light soy sauce over it. Probably won't order this again unless the noodles are rolled out thinner. Baked pork bun- these buns looked great, all nicely golden brown with a light layer of sticky syrup to give it a sheen. The bun itself is soft and tasty, but I had to take literally 4 bites of the bun to get any ""char siu"" or bbq pork filling. Slightly disappointing. Cocktail bun- these buns seem to be quite popular, as the lady took one quick round trip around just half the room and they were gone. 3 buns come in one order. These are long shaped buns with some sesame on top. Inside are sweetened coconut filling and the bun is soft. A good combo and better than many other places I've tried. Chinese tamale (jung) - A lotus leaf surrounds the savory goodness of rice, pork and green beans and chinese sausage (lap churng). They also have the option of peanuts instead of green beans if you want. Fried taro puff- Mashed up taro is stuffed with minced pork, green onions with 5 spice powder and fried up with this puffy coating. I thought the taro puff here was a bit harder or denser than some places I've tried. Steamed shu mai- is perhaps one of the more famous Chinese dim sum items as it is steamed shrimp and pork dumpling. However, the shu mai at Great Wall is mediocre at best. The shu mai is a bit denser than I am normally accustomed to and the skin falls off easily as you pick it out from the mini steamer. Pan fried turnip cake- this was surprisingly better than expected. It was pan fried to a nice golden brown on both sides and you could taste the dried shrimp, lap churng and bits of turnip. Definitely recommend trying this. Congee / Porrdige - we tried the 1000 year old egg with salted pork porridge and it was fine. Lots of chunks of egg and pork mixed in the porridge. The bill came out to be a little over $27 for 3 people - not bad at all. I haven't tried their dinner items so this review is just for their dim sum. Over all, one of the better places that I've encountered while visiting the Phoenix area. Would come back for dim sum again and will give this place a try for dinner sometime soon. ",0,0,0,1,0

 It is so exciting to finally have an excellent restaurant up here in Anthem! Vic Vegas and his team have really outdone themselves. Although they are still in the soft opening phase, the service and quality of food are top notch. The views from the restaurant are incredible looking over the valley . Earlier in the week, we enjoyed dinner there with friends. All of the appetizers were excellent! Especially enjoyed the calamari and the black and blue sliders. When you sit down, they say ""welcome home to Vic's....and that's exactly what you feel like. The mixed drinks are excellent (interesting glassware, but it's fun)!!!. Last night we tried their onion/macaroni and cheese soup that was delicious. We were impressed with the service both nights we were there...Vic was walking around and checking on how things were going which is something that all restaurateurs should do. We wish them well in this new venture! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've always liked Mr. Lucky's. Huge selection, always open, large portions, and low prices. I've gotten the $7.77 special countless times, and it's always been very filling and tasty. I've had the ahi tuna sandwich and really enjoy that. I've had a couple salads and have enjoyed them. Nachos are delicious. Fajitas are delicious. I can't think of one thing I've had here that's not good. Even the fries are pretty stellar. I will subtract a point, though... last time I was here, it was right after the Death Cab for Cutie show at the Joint... a sold out show, or close to it. My roommate Adam and I wanted to try their new off-menu special, $9.99 all-you-can-eat prime rib. We sat down amongst all the other concert-goers and were told after a long wait for a waiter that they were out of prime rib. Really? After a big show at the Joint you're going to be out of prime rib? There was even a sign out front of the restaurant advertising it. I wasn't pleased, but we dined there anyway. Oh well. ",0,0,0,1,0

 What a gem! Somewhat recently, I was talking with a foodie friend of mine about how much I sorely missed foie gras (we live in California). She informed me that she and her mom sometimes bring back fresh foie driving home from Vegas - storing it in a cooler, on ice. I decided to give it a shot. My mother, who also loves her foie, was down. I found Artisanal Foods through a quick online search, did a bit of research on it, and was sold. We opted to go there on our way home. Artisanal Foods is located in a small shopping center, right by the airport. And as other reviews mentioned, the store is pretty small. But it's a great place with all kinds of foodie treats - truffles, escargot, yuzu, beautifully marbled beef, cheese and, of course - treasure chests (fridges and freezers) filled with to the brim with giant lobes and slices of foie gras. I didn't catch the name of the girl helping us yesterday, but she was wonderful and super knowledgable. She really knew her stuff. She presented us with two foie options: frozen, yet sliced, deveined, and ready to cook, or entire fresh livers (which required deveining). Since my mom was the one buying, she decided to go the hardcore route and buy the whole fresh liver. I also got a really great and highly recommended Spanish cheese. Even better was that their foie provider is none other than La Belle Farms (there's a great article about their ethical foie gras production, you can read it here: http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/12/the-physiology-of-foie-why-foie-gras-is-not-u.html). I do love animals as well as meat, so I try my best to be as ethical as I can with my meat choices - Hudson Valley and La Belle are the only two farms I buy/order foie gras from. Major props to Artisanal Foods for supporting farms like La Belle. Whether you're a local or just passing through, this shop is most definitely worth a stop. I highly recommend it! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Pros: Clean, games are in working order, mostly. Cons: Expensive. Their model is well executed, charge for everything. Think Chuck E. Cheese but 2014, the only thing that's changed are the games.

Don't get me wrong, it can be fun but after burning through $40 with two kids in 20 minutes, it's clear who's getting ""played"". :) ",0,1,0,0,0

 Tried this buffet for lunch. Impressed with variety. Has some dishes you don't typically see at a buffet including a decent selection of asian dishes.

 Regis at University Square used to be my backup salon, but since it was torn down and my usual salon was booked up, I decided to try the Regis Salon at West Towne. The salon was clean, the staff was polite and relatively speedy. The stylist I had was very friendly and asked lots of questions, which was great and I thought I was happy with the cut until I got home and really got a chance to take a look at it. She styled it very nicely, but I guess she just assumed that I would always want to style it exactly the same way, because as soon as I moved a hair it was a disaster area. I asked for a layered collar-bone length cut with a bit of texture and long side bangs. I ended up with bangs that were two inches longer on the right side of my face, hair an inch longer on the right side, completely blunt ends that were at least two inches below my collar bone. I look like I had my hair cut by a one-eyed high schooler. If I wasn't leaving town tomorrow I would go back in and demand they fix it. Only giving two points because of the clean and friendly atmosphere and that one stylist put on Muse for awhile. I'm sorry I didn't wait and go to Studio 924. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I only come here to eat their black bean noodles and it is delicious!! The rest of their Korean-Chinese menu is ok but I had better. The service can be pretty rude. My boyfriend and I are Asian and he's very americanized. He wasnt too hungry so he wanted to order chow mein from the ""whitey"" menu. The big Korean lately literally said ""No! You order from this menu"" pointing to the Chinese menu. She basically told him this 3 times and told him to get jap chae. I normally would have snapped but i love chop chae so i just watched in amusement. He eventually gave in and complained about the food he got. The jap chae wasnt the traditional yummy jap chae. It was saucey with sir fry sauce and filled with bell peppers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 A welcome addition to the businesses in this part of the Valley. This large store is clean, spacious, and has a very wide variety of fresh produce, meats (including many kinds of organ meats), seafood, cooking utensils, and other items. Here you can find packaged and canned goods from several countries, including India, Africa, and the Mediterranean area. As with any big Asian food store, part of the pleasure in shopping here is discovering many items that you will not find in most food stores, big or small.

 A nice surprise in a hard to find location. It's located on a small street parallel to Spring Mt. Road, the long street that takes you the Wynn. The street is basically the rear parking lot to the main strip of restaurants and is easy to miss. Get the cha chang mien, stir fried bean curd, shredded pork in brown sauce (comes served atop a bed of cabbage), and the house special noodles and soup (item #1). The chicken was gamy so I tossed it aside, but the broth was light and just right. Everything else had me thinking I'd be back for another nice meal. Other reviewers were on the mark about the level of oil the restaurant uses on some dishes but it was tolerable. More authentic and out of the ordinary if you're willing to try a different menu. You won't find sweet and sour pork or walnut prawns here if you're craving Chinese Am. But what a pleasant alternative in the middle of nowhere. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The Cove Trattoria is a hard place to find with your GPS. It is actually off Indian Bend Road, even though the address is Scottsdale Road.

Once you get inside, the food selection is Italian in nature. The menu size was not too impressive, but I found something that I liked. I ordered a Mediterranean pasta with chicken.

 Not as I expected...Dinner buffet for $21.99? Totally not worth it. The food quality is average and below but they charge you like a buffet in Vegas. The Sushi are pre-made and setting on the tray, not fresh made per order. Very limited choice. The sashimi are thinly slice and taste not fresh too. When ask for a sashimi, the guy give you a pile of sashimi and put them on your plate, no presentation or anything..(there you go...eat it!!) The Oysters, some fresh some not. Few of those are sitting on the ice under the light for a long time, I have some of those and they are warm, not fresh! Salad and fruit bar, I believe the pineapple from the can, and the oranges are from one of the backyard, so sour. The soup choice are Hot and Sour soup, Egg drop soup and miso soup...very basic and you could find them in any Chinese buffet for $5.99 AYCE. $21.99, I expect better quality of soup. Hot and Sour soup, not hot not sour. Very disappointed. The clams, almost every each one of them have sands in it. After a couple of those clams, I don't even want to try it. The mongolian grill (the noodle, cook per order). The food choice are very limited. The BBQ ribs, too dry! The other food are average, you could find it in any Chinese buffet for half price or under $10 bucks! This restaurant 1-2 stars the most. I won't recommend other to try this place, even with a coupon...don't waste your money. I would recommend go to Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet, same buffet style, food are better, more choices, taste better, fresh sushi (made per order), and lower price ($15.99), I vote that for 4 stars at least.

 The best feature is the pool, which is quite nice. The beds are pretty good. Everything else about this place screams for a merciful bulldozer. Plumbing didn't work, and the floorboards were so thin in places I thought I was going to fall through. They lost my golf travel bag after putting us in the wrong room;the bag was lost as they moved our luggage from one to the other. Walls between units are very thin which was a great learning experience for my 11 year old son. Don't order drinks at the pool: you get a 4 oz cup for ten bucks. Most of the group we were with left and checked in at other hotels. We had a low rate but if you are paying their normal rate of 300 per night, you are getting ripped off..

 Arrived for lunch and was greeted by friendly waitress. Explained that a drink was included with lunch and brought us two Turkish teas in pretty little glasses. I ordered the Adana Durum (Wrap) 7.70, Ground meat lamb Adana kebab and yogurt sauce on the side. My friend ordered a gyro. Oddly she brought the gyro dinner to my friend, but quickly replaced it with the correct sandwich. I enjoyed my sandwich especially the yogurt. It was in nice bread and hot. I wished there was more ingredients since it was tasty but not very interesting. There also was just a small amount of yogurt... Could have had a larger or second container. Waitress was slow to fill water and to return for payment. Overall nice but not that memorable . I looked for grape leaves, hummus or other items that we could share but they were not on the menus we had.

 Now this place is interesting... especially if you're a pirate! I went to Giligins as part of a Happy Hour pub crawl, and was not quite sure what to expect. Well, the drinks were cheap and they had great food specials, but I was afraid to try anything... so I didn't. It's quite the dive bar that's for sure. I think it would probably be a better time if weren't the only ones in the bar. I have no complaints about Giligins in general, I just didn't like it. It wasn't what you would expect to find in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. I would only recommend going to Giligins if you have some time to kill in between some better places.

 I had always wanted to see the mother of all Cirque De Soleil shows, presumably ""O"" at the Bellagio, but tickets were always sold out while I was in Vegas. Somehow this past July 4 weekend, I was able to get tickets only a couple days before I left home. I had seen all other Cirque de Soleil shows in Vegas, such as: ""KA"", ""Zumanity"", ""Mystere"", ""Le Reve"", so my expectation for this O show was very high. The stage for O was the most elaborate and beautiful. I give it a 5-star. But the show itself was boring. It was nothing but a bunch of acrobatic performances. I've seen them all already at the Circus Circus Hotel and Casino(minus the water) in Vegas and the shows there were free, I didn't have to pay a dime for it. Somehow they perform the same stunts at the O and they charge you $200 to see it. There were a lot of things going on around the stage while the main act is undergoing. Actors were running around, yelling, singing, dancing but it's just to give you an impression that the show is big and the acts are grand but in reality they know the acts are boring so basically they have a bunch of people running around so the audience doesnt fall asleep. Basically it's nothing but a bunch of boring acrobatic performances in a beautiful theater. That's all there is to it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've been to Vida multiple times and seen all iterations of service here. Lunch, dinner, brunch, special events, during the DNC. It's a prime location in the EpiCentre with a killer patio and great mezzanine. Here's the breakdown: Bar - Two. Upstairs and downstairs. Both have relatively the same offerings. Bartenders are friendly and attentive and make up a mean margarita. Most recently, we had some killer margaritas with Cointreau Noir -- much better than standard Grand Marnier. They have a decent selection of beers, but they stick to the Mexican food-centric bottles/draughts. Food - Incredible guac. Let me rephrase that -- I'd eat a whole meal of guac and chips and be a happy camper. I've never had anything from Vida that I wouldn't get again. I will say that my favorite time to dine is now brunch on Sunday. Try the chilequiles and thank me later. *drops mic* Only downside that I can really comment on is the unassociated parking situation for the EpiCentre. ""Yeah, yeah, yeah....WE KNOW, Ben,"" they exclaimed and clamored exhaustively. We all know it. We all hate it. It's expensive, validated parking isn't the norm, and so on. Just buck up and pay the piper. It's worth the meal. OR, find a spot on the street post 6pm or on the weekends when it's free as well. Vida, thanks...for everything. I can haz guacamole? ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was driving a minivan that got a whopping 12 miles to the gallon on average and was chewing through my checkbook like my mom on a cheesecake. I wasn't going to trade it in, but just as my warranty expired, my brake problems that had been plaguing me since the day I bought the vehicle used came to a head. With my kids in the car, I pushed on the brakes, and they were VERY slow to respond. Fortunately, no accident. Unfortunately, the brake problem that the dealership insisted was nothing, over and over again, was now a 2,500 dollar + issue. The dealership, of course, was more than happy to ""fix"" at full price. At this time, I decided enough was enough, and I went to go trade the van in. For the past 10 years or so, I had driven vehicles as dictated by ex wives, and I was also fed up with that! So I decided I was going to get something sporty. I got myself into a 2008 Chevy Cobalt Sport. Awesome. Brown and Brown Chevrolet, I will sing the praises of your finance department to the ends of the earth. But, as they say in the Conan movies, ""that is another story"". I went home and I called GEICO. I had been a customer of theirs for 5 years, and I have a perfect driving record. I was paying only 98 bucks a month on my van. I shouldn't get THAT much of an increase for my sporty new car. It was in about 30 minutes or less, that I learned just how much money I wouldnt be saving on my Auto Insurance if I stayed with GEICO. 98 bucks suddenly turned into 290 bucks a month, with a 420 dollar down payment. I called them and asked them to check this out about 4 times. They said there was nothing they could do. I was desperate, and my required balloon payment was right around the corner. I had no idea that now, on top of a higher car payment, my insurance payment was going to triple and then some. In comes the hero of the day, Scott Thomas. For a very small increase in my monthly payment on my van, Scott was able to line up auto insurance coverage that blew GEICO and other insurance companies away. I was astonished at how much money I saved by switching AWAY from GEICO. The entire time I was in his office, his office staff kept my children entertained with movies and snacks. They didnt want to leave! Thank you Scott Thomas and staff. You provided me with customer service and great rates that went beyond anything I could have expected otherwise. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Ahh, nothing beats the scent of body odor, cigarette smoke, and beer on a beautiful Sunday afternoon at Walmart. Hey, we can get these free smells at almost any Walmart. Once you have been to one Walmart you have been to them all. Cheap prices and everything you could ever want to purchase all in one place! Rock on! Having said that, this Walmart's layout is pretty bad. Everything is scattered around the store, and it is so hard to find what your looking for. I think they want you to wander around aimlessly with no sense of direction. Of coarse the only people who actually work at Walmart are the cashiers, so good luck finding someone to point you in the direction of the hand soap section. Sadly, there are other Walmart locations that are better. (Did I just say that?) ",0,1,0,0,0

 We showed up at 5:30 without reservations. There were only two tables seated in the restaurant, and we were told that they were full with a lot of snobbery and little concern for our opinion of their establishment. We were very excited to try the place, and the experience was completely wrecked by the very unwelcoming attitude. The food looked good, but the attitude was definitely not. Regardless of when everyone else shows up, you can at least let someone sit at the bar for an hour dinner when they're is only two other tables seated in the whole place. We definitely would have been gone by the time the last reservation arrived. I can't really truly convey how disappointing and almost downright humiliating it is to be told the restaurant is booked when there are 8 people sitting in the entire place and 20+ empty tables. While I understand opentable and the reservation system (and often use it myself), there is something to be said for being a human being and making a little effort. Perhaps a nicer explanation and an offer of a drink and an appetizer at the bar. I'm a little disappointed in myself for not making even a little bit of a scene, or being as rude to the hostess as she was to us. I'm not normally that way, and rarely consider doing so in a restaurant (especially where I'm planning to eat), but I was downright PISSED at the haughty ""we don't give a sh*t"" about your patronage attitude as we walked down the street. We ended up going a few blocks away to Chez L'epiecier http://www.yelp.ca/biz/chez-lepicier-restaurant-bar-a-vin-montreal for one of the best meals of my life. Save yourself some frustration, and just go there instead if you don't mind spending a few dollars more. I'm sure the food is probably good if you don't mind the potential of being treated like just another diner. I've had better service at McDonalds. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Disclaimer: This is a vegan's view I expect most high-end restaurants to be able to put together something vegan, especially if you ask without regard to price. But after being seated here with a fairly large party, I asked what my options were for something vegan. I don't expect miracles, but in Carnevino, the waiter came back and said the chef would take care of me. I ended up with salad and some vegetables, but filling enough and very good. And I had something with every course. At Table 10, I got a response that I'm used to from chains like Applebees. The waiter came back and said that they didn't really offer anything vegan, and only suggested a salad, though didn't offer specific recommendations on which had dressing without egg or dairy. Ultimately I ordered fries, spinach, and charred peas. It ended up being filling enough, but unsatisfying overall. The $9 serving of spinach was ordinary, though the charred peas were good.

 I guess I can't reiterate this enough, Doc and Eddy's is OK. I don't think it's as bad as Cat C. makes it out to be, but not nearly as great as Jared R. reviewed it - just OK. Cheap beers, pitch black if you walk in from daytime. Grabbing a few pitchers won't set you back by much money, and there's tons of space if you have a larger group of friends. What separates Doc and Eddy's? Table tennis! What a rare find. There are precious few bars that stray outside of the billiards mentality and D & E's is one of them. Go by the current average of D & E's reviews and see just how...average it is. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Formerly the Las Vegas Hilton, the Las Vegas Hotel is a great place to stay. Although it is a ways away from the main strip, it is located at a stop on the tram and offers a variety of restaurants, clubs, etc. my husband and I even booked our wedding through the Chapel here. Highly recommend. I knocked it down a star because I think I got lost every time I tried to go back to my room. It can get confusing in the towers! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Been back many times since the original review. The expansion is great, so glad to have more space. The food is still amazeballs.

 I've driven past this joint any number of times, usually on my way to the Waldhorn and in no mood for coffee. But it's been bookmarked for a long while and I was feeling caffeine deprived and here we are. Funky vibe with graffiti all over the walls and furniture. Lots of mismatched furniture but plenty of spots to sit and do the Internet while you suck down some very tasty joe. I had a hazelnut latte and it was perfect. Strong coffee underneath but very tasty. There were some delicious looking pastries under the glass, plus they do sandwiches and pannins (and even some bottled beers??) but this was only a coffee stop today. Internet worked well, seats were comfy and the coffee rejuvenated me. Good stuff! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I am a HUGE fan of this place! I love the earthy/granola feel this grocery/restaurant/deli/random knick knack store has! Parking is limited, but that doesn't seem to stop anyone from going. You go in and it's crowded with merchandise you can buy, random groceries, and people in line to order food. Their menu mainly consists of salads, omelettes, sandwiches, and coffee/juice. They also have a delicious selection of desserts! I've been here twice and both times I've gotten the veggie sandwich. I think it's absolutely perfect... except that the bread has a tendency to get soggy easily and the sandwich falls apart. That's -1 star, but everything else is GREAT. Wish we had LGO in the Bay!

 Am in town for my daughter's regionals gymnastics meet. 9 pm at night and we needed carbo loading for her to compete on next day. Hotel recommended Oregano's which was a pleasant surprise. We almost didn't stay as there was a 30 min wait and we needed to get the kid food and to bed, but as she was eagerly scrutinizing the menu selections, the hostess told us that 3 seats at the bar were opening up and we could order from full menu there. What a life saver! The hostesses were really friendly and nice. Sat at bar and Matt served us. Gave us great and honest recommendations without being pushy. Was really friendly with good sense of humor. Was really efficient and on the ball too. He made the experience so much better. From our seats, we could also see the Pit Crew making the pizza dough which was fun to watch. The salads were wonderfully enormous as we eat a lot of salad! The three of us shared one large salad - can't remember name but was the special salad- really delicious. Then we got lasagna for kid and us parents ordered the Alfredo the Dark that Matt recommended which was very good, added sausage and chicken. Sizable portions - still no room for dessert. Overall, atmosphere was lovely, staff was friendly and terrific (esp Matt), food was filling and delicious, and we had a great time. We may go back tonight to try something else! :-) Went back again tonight - ended up at the bar again. Caitlyn served us and was fabulous - sense of humor, quick service, honesty - I think Oregano's is just great. When I'm back in Phoenix, I'll be coming to this location. FYI, ALL the staff are super-friendly. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I've noticed some of the more current reviews are low like mine, perhaps something has changed since the DDD review. I'm a native Arizonan and was back in town for a short trip. Having been to many taco shops I was excited to try this one after the DDD episode. My family all came along (yup we were able to seat 10 people there), and we all agreed that Carolina's right up the street is far better. We had their tacos, enchiladas, chile rellenos, el pastor, carne asada, and beef chimichanga. Nothing was awful, but it certainly is not the best Arizona taco shop food. If you really want to try some great taco shop food, I would recommend Los Compadres on 7th Avenue between Camelback and Indian School, or Carolina's further up Union Hills. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Good place for groups since it's dark, trendy music, and colorful drinks. Not so much for a romantic night. I've been to Tao New York few years ago and was not so impressed by fancy expensive Chinese food. It was just a place that I can say ""Yeah, I've been there"" and not return again. Somehow I found myself here in the deviation also known as Las Vegas' version. The best way I can describe Las Vegas spun versions restaurants (ie Mesa Grill, Delmonico, David Burke, Koi, etc etc) is large productions, lacking heart and character in its food. Mass production? We ordered the miso glazed salmon which was fine, the size of the fish was beyond my expectations (insert my mass production epiphany), spicy toro tartar on crispy rice.... a nice attempt at copying Koi's signature dish but fell short on the crispy rice, it was too thick so the crispyness did not stick together but fell all over my plate.... some Filet Mignon yaki udon dish that really made me miss Oh! Taisho's kimchi yakiudon but I digress. It was a very bland dining experience. The only good thing - we were able to receive comps to Tao Nightclub. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Stopped in on the Fourth of July for evening cocktail and small meal. From horrible service to terrible seafood...would never return. We waited a very long time for cocktails and order to be taken, when there was little crowd around in the restaurant. Then, our oyster order came out on a plate of water, not ice. They were small and shriveled up and warm. Next, the mussels in white wine sauce....hahahah. Um, no...it was more like garbage sewer sauce. Mussels were freezing COLD. Had to search for a server to get the check, took a long time again. Normally, I would complain right then and there for such terrible food and service but it was one of those days that was going so nicely that complaining about food would just ruin mine and my husband's infrequent night out without kids. I did feel strongly enough to write this review. How can a seafood place serve terrible seafood? I have never given a 0 star review and have worked in the food service industry.

 I don't like to give out 5 stars being that it's the mecca of ratings and all, but this place nailed it. It has it all, great food, great service, and great atmosphere. I was torn between the Salmon Tartini (I think that's what it was called) and the choriza enchillada. I'm pretty sure neither would be a miss, but I heard through the grapevine that their chef makes the chorizo. Thus, I was directed that way. It was a great tasting dish, perfect for my Sunday hangover. I also had a peanut butter and banana protein shake which I sucked down like the Hoover Dam! It was delicious. If you like a little live entertainment, I'd suggest hanging out at the bar and observing the very friendly, outgoing staff (all good looking women as well, always a plus!). Before I blew that hot dog stand, I grabbed a coffee to go. I don't know what it was, but it was the perfect blend of smooth and bold. I can't wait until next time to try out that Salmon! ",0,0,0,0,1

 My wife and I stayed for three nights that we paid for in advance. A friend raved about the place. We really didn't care for it and would have moved to a hotel if not for the advance payment. The main problem is the place is unattended much of the time. Unlike most B&bs, the owners don't live there. We arrived late and couldn't get an answer on the phone or a call back. We found the place ok, but it was all locked up. A note told us where to find the key. So we managed, but it was off putting to have no one there. The room was small and lacked utility--no dresser or shelves and only a tiny wardrobe for coats. Breakfast isn't served until 8:30 a.m.! Come on. That's ridiculous. And it was pretty mediocre too. The room and the inn we're clean and the location is good. We won't be back. ",0,1,0,0,0

We also both had the cream soda...a great change from the usual soft drink offerings. Definitely putting Hopdoddy into our lunch rotation. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I do not share the excitement of Rebekah for this place. Why is it a sports bar has to look weathered, dirty and old. I swear people design these places trying to make it look like it has been there forever. Okay, so that is the decor which is just so... well... un-exciting and predictable. The food. Hmmm... see above. un-exciting and predictable. Service was okay. The staff seems engaged and want to do a good job but I swear (and I know I am harping back on the decor) the decor sucks the life out of you. Where is the energy? Excitement?

 My family and I decided to try this place out last night. It's located right next to Carlos O'Brien s, has a nice parking lot layout. The place is decorated with a Hawaiian theme with flat screens playing surfing videos. We ordered with the gal at the front counter and she was SUPER nice and giving recommendations on drinks and such but didn't really tell us what to expect or how the routine was. We didn't realize that you're supposed to get your own silver, napkins, condiments, etc. We ordered 3 mains, 3 appetizers, and 2 beers and a tea, and the bill before tip came to over $82.00 which gave us all a little shock. We didn't have a problem with the bill; most places in Scottsdale are about this price BUT usually, the places that charge $20 or more per person also include table service and a set table. We had the calamari appetizer, the coconut shrimp appetizer, fish tacos, fish & chips, and a chowder. The calamari was excellent, the coconut shrimp was very decent (good dipping sauce-sweet/spicy but I suspect frozen). My dad loved his tacos, my mom not so much (she felt like they could have put more fish and less fluff cabbage on it, especially since you're paying over 10 bucks for just two tacos). I loved my fish (great breading on the mahi!) but the chips were obviously frozen shoestring potatoes that they had fried up on order. Don't get me wrong, they tasted decent enough but maybe they shouldn't say everything is made from scratch when it isn't....My husband thought the chowder was nothing special as it tasted like canned chowder soup that they had tossed previously frozen seafood bits into and doctored up. My folks couldn't stop raving about the beers though! The food was out to us in under 10 minutes after ordering which surprised us as the dining area was full of people. We had food runner (maybe a supervisor of sorts?) who was nice enough to grab silver and etc for us but he was BAKED. (red eyes, delay in reaction, awkward interactions-the guy was not only baked but was something closed to SUPER baked :P). The guy was really nice but it was pretty darn obvious. The food was really good but the casual atmosphere just doesn't match the price points that they have going and almost serves as a deterrent from going on the regular. I would hate to see this place close due to greedy prices but I fear that's the path they are taking :/ ",0,0,1,0,0

 Absolutely average at best. Service is pretty slow and the pork sandwich I had was very greasy. Restaurant was clean except the gang banging graffiti in the restroom. Pulled pork was ok, IMHO I believe no sauce should be put on your sandwich. Should always be on the side so we know you're not hiding anything with sauce, but as I said earlier, greasy. Single rib was just ok too. Obviously they do not take the time to remove the membrane from the back side. Pretty important to me. No combustion ring either. I think they may be cheating some way. Ive never smoked ribs, or anything else for that matter, that didn't have a ring when done. Potato salad tasted old and a bit over peppered. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is not just my mainstay place to lay my head for the frequent business trips I've been taking to Montreal for the past 13 months, but it's also one of the two W Hotels (the other being W Chicago Lakeshore Drive) which I use to judge every other Starwood property by. From Karyne welcoming me as the Commercial Sales Manager and inviting me to the SPG Elite drinks (and organizing a surprise birthday welcome for a fellow SPG Elite colleague) to Eric welcoming me warmly as the Resident Manager, to Fran \ u00e7ois making everything just right as the W Insider - this place works. The Concierges will go *above and beyond* for whatever you need - I had one offer to bring in his personal scanner on a Saturday because I urgently needed to get something scanned and sent, and then he found an even more efficient way to get it done. The Front Desk rock. Need to extend your stay? Whatever/Whenever! Need more towels or a lufa sent to your room - iPhone app or a call to a super-nice person is all you have to do. The Bell staff are always attentive and on top of their game. Rooms are generally fab, and however full the property may be, they'll make SPG members feel very very welcome. My only main complaint is the rainhead showers. Sorry, but I *need* more water-pressure. My best shower here was actually in an Accessible room, as the little hand-held spray is *so* much more powerful and efficient. My other recco is to spring for one of the larger rooms with a tub. You'll love your soak. No review would be complete without mentioning the man that makes all the nightlife happen in the downstairs. Duane - you're trouble. Of the best sort. I've stumbled blearily into many many meetings because of you, and I don't regret a minute of it.

 This service is far too expensive. They came this morning, 3 girls. My mom was at home while I was at work. Here are the major problems: Stuff was not put back where it was supposed to be, they left my heavy daughter's plug in swing in the middle of her nursery, they didn't dust off the top of my tv entertainment center, they put shoes on top of a banister and left them there, they were told to clean the outside table/chair set and they left a huge sandy spot on top of the table and cobwebs all in between the chair legs. For the expensive price, for 3 people for $75 per hour, which took them 3.5 hours to clean a 2,400 sq foot house - DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE COST. Generally the rest of the house was fine but a 5 star service this is NOT. I would like to post pictures of the dust, the swing in the room, and the cobwebs. I was also told their yelp coupon was NOT valid for the INitial cleaning. In addition, all the windows have vertical blinds and although they cleaned them, they were all turned in different ways which means I had to turn each vertical blind into the right direction so that they were aligned and functional again. Seriously? Do they not know how blinds work? Not a very professional service. I will NEVER use them again and I hope this helps you make a decision regarding spending a lot of your money. UPDATE: After I posted this Lorenzo called me and asked what went wrong and then sent 3 girls to come to my house the very next morning to clean up what they hadn't the day before and offered a discount for next time I use their service. I do appreciate the gesture and that the girls did the right thing and cleaned what they had missed the first time. They also had a supervisor with them. They did do a good job cleaning and 4 days later the house still feels clean so I appreciate that. So I gave one more star for the rating. However, I still don't think a person has to complain about the services or point out the mistakes as the girls are cleaning or to have them make two trips over two days in order for a real professional cleaning job to be done.

 Originating from Asia I am a huge fan of bubble tea and have visited and tried almost every places in Madison that has bubble tea on their menu. Being centrally located close to campus I have visited Steepery plenty of times since they first opened about 2 years ago. I like how they use authentic tea (black or green) in their beverages; I can always taste the tea in every sip. They are also very good at customizing every beverage you order (sugar level, ice etc). I have tried black tea, green tea as well as their shakes and fruit smoothies. My favorite by far are still the traditional classics -- taro black tea and matcha green tea. For smoothies, the pina colada offers a refreshing feeling especially for the summer The only thing I avoid are, sadly, their bubbles, after several occasions of having bubbles that were not cooked all the way -- soft on the outside and hard on the inside. This is pretty unfortunate as the chewy bubbles are an integral part of bubble teas. I haven't gone back to try their bubbles again in a while now, so I am not sure if they are more consistent. I still visit Steepery often for their teas or smoothies, just that I order my beverages without bubbles. Bonus -- You get a free upgrade to a large drink for every check-ins =) ",0,0,1,0,0

 They were replacing the window motor in my ford explorer (a very simple fix). I even brought the part with me, and they got it in the garage right away with a quote of around $100, so at this point I was excited. It ended up taking over 2 hours to replace the part, and there were about 5 people trying to figure out the problem at different times. Many times the car was completely unattended in the garage for over 15 minutes at a time. When the car was finally done, the window control panel was all kinds of messed up, Im not sure exactly how that happened. Good price, but you get what you pay for I guess.

 I like settler's Ridge and yes this is me, the same guy who bashed The Waterfront and South Side Works. So why do I like Settler's Ridge? They brought several stores that are new to the Burgh. Ross just opened, I can walk in there and get four Polo shirts for less than fifty bucks, I also got a Joyce Chen wok for less that fifteen bucks. Of course, Ross isn't the only reason I like Settler's Ridge. The flagship of the new Market District idea of Giant Eagle is located here, a new movie theatre, several new restaurants including the area's second Red Robin and PF Chang's. What I don't like about Settler's Ridge, can anyone name a strip mall in Pittsburgh that doesn't have a Michael's? Honestly are there that many people looking for beads, glue guns, or buying wall hangings that need framed? Settler's Ridge has a great Barnes and Nobel, many new restaurants (although most are chains), There's a Thai restaurant, a Japanese Sushi house, and another cool new store called 5 Below, nothing's over five bucks here. There's also an LA Fitness, and Panara, it's actually one chain I don't mind, keeping in mind Pittsburgh's lack of bagel places. Also, a new Cinemark movie theatre which I found to be extremely expensive. I'll stick to the AMC at the Waterfront, even though this theatre has a popcorn bar to dress up the nine dollar bag of popcorn with a variety of spices and toppings. Over all, when I think of the new strip malls in the city or outlying areas like The Pointe, Waterfront, South Side Works, and Robinson Town Center, to me Settler's Ridge is the least offensive. With the new exit off 376 it's east to enter and exit Settler's Ridge too. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Tried the place for lunch. Not memorable. We are both fans of Indonesian food and this tasted nothing like what we have had before. The specialty chicken was fatty and greasy, kfc is better. Three much better options in the same strip mall. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Food: The lunch special really surprised us. The portion was enormous. We ordered the Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad and Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta: The pasta was kinda sweet yet spicy at the same time. We really enjoy it. Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad: I kinda like the fried onion strings on top. It was very crispy and crunchy. However, there was too much dressing on the salad. The only thing amazing about this place is their Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake!! We are in love with it! Atmosphere and Service: Long wait time and the service was really slow. The indoor design is nice, but the outdoor building design looks much more amazing. Overall: Definitely recommend everyone to come try out their cheesecakes! ",0,0,0,1,0

 You have got to love this place. It's the only cafe thats truly raw and organic on the eastside. They also have another location on the westside by the lakes. I buy all my supplements here and super foods such as the most amazing goji berries and other Go Raw products. The green zing is my favorite juice and I usually ask that they take out the apples for my personal preference. If you love smoothies get the superfood smoothie in a bowl with granola. To die for. I would get it every time I went. They soak their nuts (for optimal digestion) so it's truly made with care. Such a treat. Oh and if your really looking to indulge I recommend the cookies and cream which is coconut and cacao blended. Yumm. In regards to the raw wraps my favorite is the portobello mushroom wrap. Spot on. If your looking to elevate your health and gain energy, Go Raw is the way to go and you can learn so much from this place. They also have a huge book collection including recipe books, books focused on certain ailments and other cool topics. I probably bought most of the books from there. Good luck on your health journey and I hope you love this place as much as I do !!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Food good, but lost a star when our unnamed server took our drink order and never delivered it. We were excited to try the beer flights, and he brought our wedge salads divided in half, as we had requested, and we finished and still did not have our beer flights. Finally my wife got up and went to the bar and the bartender delivered the flights. I had the Study Abroad flight, which included the Belgians, and my wife had the Light of the Moon flight, which were lighter wheats. Cute little muglets but we both felt they had been sitting for awhile because they were not cold. Entrees came, and I had ordered Pork Two Ways, which included a delicious charred chop (I love charred pork!) and a generous helping of spicy chile verde pork stew, served with fried egg on top and buttered tortillas. Stack was a little hard to manipulate. My wife had the seared scallops with corn two ways with bacon and they were tasty. Food exceeded the brews. Unnamed server (Jeff on the receipt) redeemed himself by comping the extremely tardy beers, but had to leave it at three stars after this unforgivable faux pas. ",0,0,1,0,0

 On our second time eating at Tom Yum we had a very disappointing experience. It was about 5:45 and the restaurant was not busy. There were 3 of us ordering. My husband got has meal first. After a long wait my mother got her food. My husband was over half way done with his meal before my meal was brought to the table. When I looked at it I thought it did not seem to be what I ordered. It was loaded with bean sprouts and my meal was supposed to have broccoli and no bean sprouts.. I looked at the menu and was sure it was wrong. When we told the waitress she said they must have mixed up the order and would cook the right dish. So I sat and waited again. We were charged for my meal even though the other 2 diners at my table were finished before my food ever came. I noticed at other tables people received their meals at different times too.. The whole experience was very poorly handled by the kitchen and servers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I will keep this plain and simple. They washed my car, they damage my rim, they denied all responsibility, I took them to court. I won, they lost, and I received a judgement against them for more than $1100. They continued to refuse to pay me even after the judgement was entered,, nor would they still take any responsibility for their actions. They were always through out the entire ordeal condescending, very unprofessional, and rude to deal with. I finally had to send the sheriff down to their place of business to take the money owed to me by force by filing a writ of execution in court. Only then did I receive the money owed to me. This is the kind of company they are. This is the kind of company you will do business with if you use their services. The moral of this story is simple.

 With the recent cold weather we have experienced, my mother a senior (who is spending the winter here now) using the guest section of the house stated that she had been really cold the night before. Sure enough it was quite cool in her bedroom, I checked the thermostat and it was set properly, but the heater was not kicking on. The unit for that wing was down and in need of a repair. I called a local company that had serviced that unit a year or so previously (for the A/C portion) and they indicated they would be out later that day - a Friday. As the time came for the appointment, I got a call from them to inform me that their tech would not be able to make it. The earliest would be the following Monday morning. I accepted this as the house has two other units warming the house, plus I had put a space heater in her bedroom. When Monday rolled around, their tech showed up, proceeded to analyze the unit and indicated that it would cost $1800 to repair but would not recommend it since the unit was at least 12 years old and thus will give me a quote for replacing it - for $6000. I was not prepared for this diagnosis for which he charged a fee of $90. I then called Forrest Anderson for a second opinion. I was informed that it would not be any problem having a tech out that afternoon. Technician Kelly Bridge was on time and analyzed the unit, came back down from the attic in about thirty minutes and told me it was repaired. He indicated that a wire had come loose on the heater and that was why it was not coming on, and by the way someone had serviced the unit previously and had not put all the screws back in on the heater cover and that may have been why the cable had come loose. I was very happy to pay him $150 for the repair. Kelly, you have won over a new customer for any future work on our home. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I seriously love this place. The prices range from $6-$10. There is a person that pre-washes your car for you and there used to be one that dries it for you, but not anymore(hence why I had to dock 1 star). The car wash itself does the job it's supposed to. My car was filthy dirty but it came out looking brand new. The vacuums are free and there used to be a separate machine to run your mats through but I guess they don't have that anymore. Overall, it's a nice place to come get your car washed, but be prepared to dry and vacuum yourself! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Went here a few years ago for my friend's birthday dinner. Got the surf n turf, and was forever changed. I dreamed about going back to this place, soooo good. I'm not a big seafood person, so the surf part of my meal wasn't my fav, it tasted like lobster, and was a little too chewy for me, but that's why I really don't like lobster. It comes on a bed of lobster mashed potatoes, that are my fav. The next time I came back, I ended up having this place two days in a row, once when I treated my friend for her birthday and then the next night we went again with her family. I must say, it's not cheap, but for special occasions, it's worth it. We got comped dessert both times for both birthdays, the donuts are serious crack, like needing rehab for. I recommend getting the wine sauce for your steaks, it's the perfect touch. Service is impeccable, and people are excellent at their job. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I used to pass La Piazza many a time before the tram works destroyed the Coates Crescent/Shandwick Place area. Finally, thanks to Jackie G, a last minute chance to grab food arose and we headed here. Jackie had recommended it before as being good for gluten free. After trying to decide between risotto or gf pasta, it was nice to even have a choice between gf penne or spaghetti. We only went for main courses and this has proved to be enough as the portions are good. After the chat about Yelpers worst foods, mushrooms were on my mind, so I went for chicken, mushrooms and a cream brandy garlic sauce which was lovely! The gf pasta was cooked perfectly, something some restaurants struggle with (yes, Jamie's Italian) and the brandy in the sauce came through without being overpowered by the garlic. A good helping of mushrooms and chicken and just the right amount of sauce - enough to coat the food, not for it to swim in. Service is efficient and friendly without being obtrusive. There is a deal currently on if you book through their website and use the appropriate code for 50% off food, except the day of Her Madgesty's visit, so getting a deal on La Piazza would be a steal.

 So here's my gripes with the home delivery: The AZ Republic website promises home delivery M-F by 5:30 am, Sat by 6:00 am, and Sunday by 6:30 am. I have yet to receive this timely service; most days it is 7:30 am before the paper is thrown on my driveway. When I call Cust Service to complain, they always say that there are things that are out of the delivery person's control such as printing delays, weather, etc etc.....but EVERY DAY?! I suspect my delivery person is sleeping in every morning and getting to the deliveries when he feels like it. Most days the paper is thrown either under the car, or else barely even on my driveway, sometimes in the street gutter where rain/sprinkler runoff turns the paper into a wet mess. Again when I complain, it improves for a few days and then back to the same situation. I'm tired of fishing it out from under the car with a broom handle, or laying the paper out to dry before I can read it. I apparently can't get this delivery person's performance to improve, or even transfer my delivery to a different delivery person, so I have to put up with the same crappy service. They have just lost a 23-year customer! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I always wanted to try this place & I don't know why it took me so long! I wish I tried it sooner! The lunch specials are such a good deal! They are all about under $10 and they come with 2 piece California roll, choice of miso or Tom yum soup and salad with Japanese dressing. Beef panang curry is thicker than usual but in a good way, creamy and they actually put lychee in it. Weird but surprisingly good! The unagi (eel ) bowl is great as well. Dragon roll was also nicely made, I hate when sushi rolls fall apart in some places. I wanted to try the crepe cake w/ green tea ice cream but was too full! Definitely a regular from now on!

 I thought Kimberly Adams was one of the best doctors I've ever had until I got a letter yesterday firing me as her patient. She comes across as smart and interested and for that you overlook the sometimes extremely long wait times. She sent me for a mammogram and part of the scan was unclear so the mammo office wanted me to go back. When I went back, they wanted $380 to do the repeat scan (license to print money, right?) So I said I'd wait for my next free one and told Kimberly Adams what had happened and she didn't seem to have any problem with it while I was in front of her. Then yesterday I got a letter saying I have to find another doctor because I refused to have the follow up mammogram. So beware - if you don't keep her referrals well funded, she'll fire you too. If I could give her no stars, I would. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I am absolutely boycotting this store! And I love to shop so this should tell you that there is a serious problem. I feel like a hamster in a maze first and foremost however I have spent plenty of money here in the past but tonight I was so disgusted that I am perfectly happy not returning and paying more elsewhere. I stood in line for 20 minutes and the lines behind me just got longer and longer...and it wasn't just my line. How about open a few more lanes to get customers check out maybe? Eventually, we got annoyed put our shit back and started to walk out My boyfriend demanded to talk with a manager, Some 22 year old kid came out saying he was the manager and we said that this was poor customer service and people in line are all annoyed, etc. His response was ""That's just kinda how they do things around here.""

 I just moved back to Pittsburgh and decided to take my boyfriend to the Thai Place for a celebratory dinner. The good news was that on a Wednesday evening around 7:30, it was nearly empty and our food came out very promptly; we weren't even finished with our spring rolls when the entrees came out. The bad news is that prices have gone up, portion sizes have gone down, and the food was pretty bland. My boyfriend rated his pad thai lower than some ""fast-food"" Asian places', and my curry with a spice level of 7 was so tame, it wouldn't have bothered an infant. I'm not sure if this place was better 6 years ago, or if I just had lower standards because I hadn't tried Thai food anywhere else and I was a high school student without years of trying restaurants under my belt. At any rate, I will be on the lookout for a better Thai restaurant and would only go here if desperate. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I honestly feel that two stars is too generous of a rating for our experience tonight; however, the lone redeeming factor was my husband's gluten-free pizza - which was quite tasty. I have been to Cibo several times (probably 5 or 6 over the past several years) and have always loved the pizza. Tonight though was a different story. While the pizza was delivered rapidly; my pizza was soggy. After waiting 10-15 minutes to flag down the waitress I told her that I was unhappy with the crust. She went into a wordy explanation that this was secondary to the amount of toppings on the pizza. OK... Sure... I'll have a margherita pizza. New pizza comes out in literally 3 minutes w/ the crust WET. Definitely more soggy than the first pizza. Not even remotely cooked / chewy. Absolutely disgusting. Again wait for waitress -- now she says this is ""just how our pizzas are."" Really? You guys are in the business of serving soggy / wet pizza? Since when? I've never had issues like that before. Left without eating. (+) one star for previous positive experiences at Cibo and my hubby's decent GF pizza. Overall though the food / service tonight was an epic fail. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We enjoyed several plates here. By far my favorite was the pork belly of course. I love bacon so pork belly is a must. The pork belly came out cut up in perfect two bite morsels for me. A nice crunchy top with a soft underside is a great mix of meat goodness. The sauce is on the sweet side, but not so much that it takes away flavor. Plus it is a great sweet sauce for the meat. We also had the Pan cit Malabon, which has a spaghetti type noodle that is cut up. I mean the texture and thickness reminded me of a spaghetti noodle. The shrimp was only ok, as noted by a dinner guest on mine. I cannot comment as I am allergic to shellfish. I did chance the noodles since the top is sprinkled with pork rinds. Interesting, but not my first pick next visit. The fired chicken was good, very crispy, but for the $7.99 price 2 pieces of chicken was not what I expected. With everything else on the larger side I found this to be lacking in value for my dollar. We also sampled the flan dessert, which was creamy and sweet. Nice mix and most likely I would try again. I also tried the Halo-halo which my first experience. Nice dessert that I would go for again. A mix of sweet, ice and a small slice of flan on top. All enjoyed in a plastic cup for you to enjoy for at least a half an hour of mixing ice with the sweet bottom mix. If you are in the area and craving a great Filipino food experience stop here. I will try some other dishes next time I am in the area. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We have stayed here a couple of times using our time share. The Cliffs are a long distance from the Strip. It is much closer to Red Rock Canyon than to the action on the Strip. If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Vegas Strip, then this might be the place for you. For my wife and I, we prefer staying somewhere other than right on the main strip. Each time, we stayed at the Cliffs, there was family staying with us. We had a 2 bedroom unit so staying here made for awesome family quality time! The kids really enjoyed the pool which did not get very crowded during our summer time stays here. We were able to use their Bbq grills to cook food for dinner! We went hiking at Red Rock Canyon nearby. Our times here have been very relaxing. The rooms have always been huge and comfortable for everyone. The one time that we had an issue, management was able to resolve it. The fact that the issue took a few weeks to resolve is the reason that I can only give them 3 stars. We have not stayed there again since. Would we stay here again in the future? Yeah, if it was the only place available for our timeshare. ",0,0,1,0,0

 When fellow friend Richard G. raved and raved about how good Earl of Sandwich is and how he'd eat it any day and everyday, I thought he was just obsessed. I've had other people tell me Earl of Sandwich is good, but that was it, it was just ""good."" I'm a big fan of sandwiches so I was coming into this place with some pretty high expectations. And sure as hell, Earl of Sandwich delivered. I want to say this place ranks in my top 3 (along with Ike's and Mendocino Farms in SF and LA respectively), but where in the top 3, I'm not so sure (I'm so conflicted).

My sandwich was absolutely perfect, love the crunch of the bread and how everything just melts and comes together in your mouth. No doubt, it's an amazing sandwich. They say the line can get long, but came by Saturday afternoon and beat the lunch rush, not a long wait at all. And since it's Vegas, what a steal for such good food on the strip. Open 24/7?

Just enough tart to really pucker me up. I also tried the chocolate peanut butter thing, and that was surprisingly good. I forget that chocolate can be good in smoothie form, but this was peanut butter, too. Delightful, indeed, to wrap your lips around the straw and suck up to the decadence.

 I'll make this short and simple for those just doing a quick browse. Narcisse is all about the environment and the decor. The chandeliers, furniture, even the freaking bathroom, its all absolutely gorgeous. Its a place to have a fancy brunch and dress up in your Sunday best. The lighting is bright and happy and the live music (2 dudes playing acoustic songs) was just perfect. Unfortunately for me and you, that's where the positives end. The food is decent but overpriced at $12-14 for tiny eggs Benedict. They also have $10 bottomless bubbly 'but notice that they don't pour you actual champagne - aka its not french- the stuff we had was a Mexican brand, so be prepared to drink about 8 bottles yourself to break even on that deal. Food aside, my biggest issue with Narcisse was the server. For such a swanky place, it took waaaay to long to get any kind of service. I don't know if it was an under staffing issue, but our server (who apparently was also the bartender?) took about 30mins take our orders, another 40mins to get our food and a good 45mins just to give us our checks. It was a painful wait, especially since the restaurant was not packed (or even half full). Thankfully one of the other servers/bus boy passed by our table to fill our champagne as our actual server was nowhere to be found. short version: come for ambiance at the risk of incredibly slow service. Food is mediocre, champagne is Mexican and decor is fabulous. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The service is soo slow, a pet peeve of mine on a weekday lunch hour. Lunch time servers need to be on their best because business people need to be in and out of restaurants to get back to work.

Food was good, but they carry Pepsi Products not Coke... just in case it matters, I asked if they had Coca-Cola and waitress said yes, served it to me and surprise it was not Coca-cola, it was pepsi.

I do have to say the very large mason jars filled with tea was the only best thing about my experience.

The calamari was very blan and the burger was not juicy at all. The best thing we got was the chicken quesadilla (which is a really difficult thing to mess up in the first place). Even that was lacking in chicken... it was mostly cheese. For the price, definitely not worth it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This Is not a $6.00+ combo. Come on really, a frozen patty only 1/4"" thick for a ""charburger""? I think not. I was not impressed by this brand. I found it to be way overpriced. The burger tasted like pretty much any other burger you get from a fast food burger joint. This location has minimual seating. I honestly wasn't sure I was going to actully be able to sit inside and I didn't want to sit outside. The staff was very friendly, it didn't take long to get my meal, but those were the only good things about this visit. French fries were just that french fries. While others may make a ""Habit"" of eating here, I will not. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Stopped in for a burger before the movie. Good choice, it was prepared very quickly and it was very tasty. I had the mushroom and swiss - plenty of very thin cut mushrooms and a slice of Swiss cheese on top of a thin grilled burger. The bun was perfect. My daughter chose the bacon and avocado. She also enjoyed it thoroughly. The fries were a hit. Nice and thin shoestring fries, but not salty at all. Awesome. I put a hit of Cholula in with the ketchup and got a nice zing to them. Yum. Two burgers, fries and two drinks for under $20? I'd do this again. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We Americans like the Chinese buffet. We know its not authentic. We know its not healthy. But, it satisfies some sinful desire. Pizza, burgers, Mexican food, Chinese buffet. It is part of the American culinary fabric. If this sounds like you then this is your place. It is always busy, so you know the food has not been sitting around long. The patrons appear to be lower income. The location is great. Parking in the front and side are usually pretty full, so expect to park around back. The employees are friendly, but don't expect much English. The lunch buffet is $7.99. What a bargain! FYI: Bus loads of Chinese tourists arrive often, so beware because they will clean that place out. I'll admit, this place is one of my guilty pleasures, just don't expect quality from a $7.99 buffet. And, don't tell my foodie friends that I eat here. ; - ) ",0,0,1,0,0

 We have been to a Hash House in another location and loved it so since we were here at the Quad we wanted to eat!! Lots of people waiting to get in but it went pretty fast 15 min. They took us to a booth/chair table. I sat on the booth and went to the floor!! MY HEAD WAS AT THE TABLE!! I sat on the chair and my husband sat on the booth with a throw pillow under him so he would be comfy. The lady who sat us didn't even try to help us with this. The waiter came and took our drink order and was friendly. As we waited my husband noticed his silverware was dirty so we got a fresh set. My husband ordered Cornbeef Hash with eggs and potatos and a beer, I got salad with mango vinrigrette and sage chicken. The waiter came to us and said sorry our food is taking long but, he didn't like the looks of my salad it was all wilted so he sent it back. Yikes!! That was nice of him. Now everyone around us is eating but, us because of my salad. We got our food and my husband loved his Cornbeef. My salad there were issues. DRY!!! We had to ask for more vinergrette, which took him a while and then he never came back and asked us how we were doing or even feel up our drinks!!! In which I was waiting for my ice to melt to drink something half way through eating. I had still old and wilted lettuce it was awful. We will never go back to this location again!!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 How the flying frickity frackity does this place have 4 stars on over 500 reviews? This place was crap. We waited over a half hour to get in here and I ate a burger for the first time in over 2 years and I was very very much reminded why I gave up such things. I figured if I was going to eat a burger after all that time I was going to eat one in a restaurant by the darling Hubert Keller. After such a memorable Fleur dy Lys experience, we figured we certainly couldn't have a bad burger joint experience.... but we did. The cheese is placed on the burger far too early on the grill, therefore it all melts and slides off, by the time it gets out to the table there's pretty much no cheese. My bun was soooooo soggy on the bottom that I almost gagged. The raw onions, flimsy and flavorless, the tomato orange and unripe. What a disappointment. My husband was equally disappointed with his fancy burger. There was nothing that could have gained this place a 2nd star. Service was shit, even the soda was flat and syrupy. I'm seriously trying to figure out how our experience was so 1 star compared to all these 3, 4 and 5 star reviews? What are you all comparing these burgers to? ",1,0,0,0,0

 WOW - best Vegas buffet I've ever been to. The seafood brunch price is crazy cheap for what you get, and if you come right before the brunch ends, it's not so crowded and you get both brunch and the start of dinner - score! There was soooo much food, it was overwhelming. They had Asian food, big salad bar, carving station, pastas, and then the seafood.... There were piles and piles of steamed crab legs, cold crab legs, and crab in sauce, salmon cooked on bamboo, you name it. Admittedly i didn't go for the crab (i know, crazy huh?) cause i didn't want to go all ballistic on it in public without the right tools, which we couldnt' find. I was all over everything else though. I would list what I ate, but I can't even remember. But I know I liked everything I tried! And then my favorite - the dessert bar. They had a crepe station, gelatto, sundae bar, and cakes, cookies, mousse galore. I was in heaven! I assure you - this will be the ONLY buffet I visit in Vegas from now on. Sooooo good! ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place is a little bit out of the way for me, but I will happily travel out of my way if it means green tea kit-kat. The cashier told me they have it right now seasonally and may be running out soon, but they gave me my fix. She also helped me find barley tea and matcha green tea powder (when I try to recreate Bachi Burger's matcha green tea milkshake at home). She also told me they do sushi and bento boxes regularly, but sell out fast. I will definitely be headed back here (and crossing my fingers that another addict hasn't drained their supply of green tea kit-kat). ",0,0,0,1,0

 I went there once and was disappointed. First of all, I paid $6.50 for 16 ounces of exotic coffee. Secondly, the d \ u00e9cor and atmosphere was weird. I felt like I was in a 3rd world communal; except this one was created by students who've only read about the such places. If you bring your laptop expect to sit either next to or directly in front of a complete stranger. (A great opportunity if you want to be social, not so if you want to concentrate.) A bonus was the access to the internet, the downside was trying to maneuver over sets of extension cords laying all over the ground. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have been to this restaurant many times and several have been bad experiences with the server. They need to find someone who cares about the service they provide to the customer!

 My wife and I were staying at the New York New York hotel, and we stopped in here for a quick no-reservations meal before going to a show that night. Food: I had a burger, which was fine; there's only so many ways to screw up a burger, after all. My wife ordered an advertised special, which was steak and crab legs. She told me they were the best crab legs she'd ever had, and they certainly appeared fresh and well-prepared; I've never seen anyone have such an easy time getting huge hunks of crab meat out of the shell, especially with snow crab. So, based purely on those crab legs, they'd get a positive review. Service: Here's where things fell apart. Our server was apparently the slowest in the restaurant, which was not at all busy (we'd arrived just after 5, which is really early for dinner in Vegas). We didn't get out of there until 6:45. People who arrived after us got their drinks and meals before us, paid, and left before we even finished our meals. It took him 25 minutes from the time we ordered it to bring dessert! I mean, it's not like they had to bake the cheesecake or anything! We really had to hustle to make it to our show, even though we felt we'd allowed plenty of time before we stopped for dinner. Of course, when it came time to pay the check, he miraculously turned into Mr. Speedy. So, three stars: good food, slow service. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I bought a few gift cards from my work for a few restaurants because they finally got rid all the restrictions, including an automatic 18% gratuity. ATL Wings was one of them. We checked out their website before going there for dinner. For me, I am able to judge a company's professionalism by taking a glance at what promotes them on the web. In addition, we wanted to see what the menu looked like. The website is pretty basic but what bothered me were all the spelling and grammar mistakes. Plus it looked like something a complete amateur put together. The menu looked...decent, although everything seemed fried. We made our way down to the establishment and found it in a worn down shopping area of Chandler. It's a small joint with a handful of tables, which many were full of people. However it didn't seem overly clean. The empty tables and chairs had pieces of food on them from earlier customers and the floor wasn't any better. I was able to overlook the uncleanliness due to all the people who seemed to be enjoying their food. As we were waiting in line, I noticed a sign that says they will charge an 18% gratuity for any parties over five. Really!? This isn't even a place where you have actual servers! It's a fast food joint! I think the owners think their establishment is fancier than it truly is. Even though there were only about 4 people in front of us, the wait was nearly 20 minutes just to place an order! It seemed a bit ridiculous. Even with the long line the girl behind the register actually stepped away to get the cooks more sauces. Shouldn't the cooks be doing this? We finally placed our order; two 6 wing combos and a side of the mac and cheese bites. I handed her our gift certificate and this is where things really start going downhill for us. She was charging me the old 18% gratuity that should have been removed from their system; these restrictions were lifted. Also, we had already used a couple of the other gift certificates for other restaurants and weren't charged any gratuity. This means the memo was sent out and either the owner of ATL Wings never read it or just ignored it. Based on another reviewer saying that the employees admitted they don't get any of the tips, I'm pretty sure it's the latter. I'm sorry, is this place owned by Amy from Amy's Bakery!? You don't tip out your employees if you're charging tips? Unbelievable...the arrogance of some restaurant owners really shocks me. After trying to explain to the girl that we should not be paying any gratuity the girl said she had to charge it but would remind the owner of the change. Not wanting to seem like a jerk we just paid it and sat down. After about 10 minutes we finally got our food. If you order a soda don't expect refills because they don't have a soda machine, they just have a bunch of cans in a fridge which you have to pay for individually. Otherwise they have Kool-Aid, that's...interesting. I can see having this available maybe if this was some sort of a children's eatery place like Chuck E. Cheese or Peter Piper pizza, but otherwise I don't see why having an overly sugary punch is so great. I had the Honey BBQ wings and my boyfriend got the Cajun BBQ wings. They came with ranch, tiny celery sticks and fries. I will say the fries were actually really good! I think they tasted better than anything else we had. The wings were...okay. They had flavor! It's just that we were expecting them to be way better, as if there was going to be this huge WOW factor involved due to the ratings on Yelp. There was nothing special about these wings. In fact, our normal wing place is Native New Yorker and I definitely like theirs much better. At NNY there is a large variety to choose from; more unique, fun flavors verses ATL wings that seem to have just hotter versions of others. In addition, NNY allows you to mix as many flavors as you like. So if you want one wing of every flavor, they'll do it! Not at ATL. At least for the combos, you only get to pick one flavor. Come on, that's the best part of wings; trying multiple flavors! My wings seemed a bit over cooked, as the outsides were too crunchy for me. While their wings were decent enough the mac and cheese bites were absolutely awful! They were square shaped with overly flat bottoms. This tells me they are bought and frozen, and then deep fried when ordered. So they're not even making them fresh. This explains why these particular appetizers are terribly bland. There is absolutely zero seasoning. I ate one and my boyfriend had a bite of another, the rest were thrown in the trash. What a waste! The quality here is extremely low, and I'm really surprised this place is being raved about on Yelp. I would highly suggest trying Native New Yorker; we go to the one in Ahwatukee off of Ray and the I-10. At least here you'll get true service, with much better quality, free refills, and where multiple flavors of wings can be ordered. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Food was excellent. Kind of in a crappy part of town. They pour healthy glasses of wine =-) and the food is served in a presentation format.

 What a great meal. The restaurant is in a horrible strip mall that you would normally just drive by, yet the moment you enter you know you are in for a great experience. The food is excellent, the servers were all quite attentive, yet did not make us feel uncomfortable when we decided to spend some time after the meal was complete. If there were to be a downside it is a bit pricey, $200 for two with no alcohol. Yet the food was so good it seemed worth it. I will return. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Find peace and stillness. Sweat buckets. Grow. Nurture mind, body, and spirit. These are the things that I achieve with each practice at Yoga Hive. The teachers are all wonderful people with distinct practices, but all of their practices share a common theme: the practice is rooted in their spirit. When you step on to your mat, you will have a new and different experience with each teacher based on their energy, spirit, and experience. The studio is warm, typically around 85 degrees. With a dozen people in a class, the temperature probably hovers closer to 95 degrees. If you have not experienced heated yoga, I suggest that you try it. The warmth promotes flexibility and produces a wondrous cleansing effect. I have practiced in numerous studios around Pittsburgh, and though there are several standouts, Yoga Hive has become my home.

 I recently moved to Scottsdale and was looking for a new hair salon- so I turned to Yelp & booked an appointment with Jude. Problem #1: Upon arriving for my appointment, my stylist was with another client and didn't begin working on my hair until 15 minutes after my scheduled appointment. Apparently she was double booked and spent my entire appointment juggling her other new client and myself. Problem #2: I told her I LOVED my blonde ombre and had just moved from LA. We spoke about how it seems the ombre style in Scottsdale is much more subtle but I told her I love the fade I had achieved with my ombre and wanted it the same even it was a little more distinct. After being juggled and neglected for 2.5 hours my ""ombre"" came out as light brown/reddish highlights that inconsistently started above my ears. I couldn't stand it any longer and asked to leave. The cut, color, and style were nothing like what I asked and the service was so poor. I wasted a day sitting in the salon for nothing. I hope this review can help someone avoid the hair crisis I'm now attempting to fix. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is only for breakfast. I went to Madison to visit friends and get to game (a yearly occurence); after the Farmer's Market I came over here to grab a bite and sat at the bar. My Wisconsin half is out of practice, because while I was instinctively drawn to the amazing all Wisconsin beer list, I couldn't pull the trigger on drinking beer for breakfast. I had the Wisconsin Benedict, absolutely fantastic. The menu looked so good I couldn't really decide, so instead I came back the next day and had a great slab of walleye for breakfast. HEAVEN! The second day I had the All Wisconsin Bloody Mary. Generally I'm not BM fan, but this thing, with its local jerky,cheese, and pickled egg garnish was just too amazing looking to pass up. Yeah, a bit expensive, but I had to try it. Since I've left Wisconsin I've mostly lived in Boston and San Francisco, so I'm always in a state of shock at how cheap everything is in this state, but the prices were great. I'd be paying $5-8 more where I live for anything close to this. Not cheap for Madison or Wisconsin, but damn good. ",0,0,0,0,1

 My goal is to check out at least one of Yelp's 100 every time I leave the island so this trip to Vegas took me straight to Cafe Baguette from the airport. I was greeted by the owner, Olivier, a very nice man who introduced me to the rest of the staff that day. Being it was my first time, he recommended the egg and croissant. I ordered mine with ham and also ordered a latte and a chocolate twist. The croissant was excellent, so buttery and flaky. It was a delicious sandwich. My latte was yummy as well, especially because it was made with whole milk and I usually get mine nonfat. Baguette Cafe only offers whole milk, almond milk and soy milk. The chocolate twist, although amazing, was too sweet for me and I couldn't finish it. I think I would have loved the chocolate croissant. I really enjoyed the warm ambience of the cafe. Such friendly service made breakfast a delight! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Longing for a juicy (greasy!) burger? Well here it is, in one of the Valley's four new Smashburger locations! Juicy, juicy, juicy! Nice taste. Probably the closest to my favorite (""Steak and Shake"" - none in the Valley or west of Texas) I have had. Opted for the 1/2 pound and it is too big. Big question is - worth more than twice the price ($4.99 for 1/3 pound and $5.99 for 1/2 pound) as for ""In and Out"" double-double and unfortunately the answer is no, I don't think so. Much like Fudruckers, which I would rate ahead of Smashburger for taste, it will be a ""once in a while place"" for me. The ""Haystack Onion Rings"" were to die for, but a VERY small order, that without a sandwich are priced at a very pricey $2.99 ($1.99 with a sandwich)! Excellent! Very clean, lots of help and nicely done, but prices are a bit much for fast food Hamburger. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have always enjoyed going to this 4-story Belk at SouthPark mall. The parking deck parking can be a bit of a pain trying to avoid all of the valet parking places, but once you find a spot, it's thousands of square feet of awesome. Last night was a particularly good trip with some great sales going on. Belk typically has quite a selection of red dot clearance items, and last night was no different. I purchased a Ralph Lauren dress that was originally $169 for $31 (several discounts, plus signing up for a Belk card got it down to that price)! I also got several other work appropriate dresses for under $20 each, leaving the store with a sack full of clothes for $120. And the salesperson, Phyllis, was an absolute delight. She took quite a bit of time with me (it was just after work on a Friday and the store wasn't terribly busy yet) and I really appreciate the great customer service, she was fantastic. I walked through the shoe section, but I am beginning to think if you aren't a pole dancer, it is really hard to find shoes (this goes for the other department stores as well) and I had trouble finding anything I liked - the shoe department is large and kind of overwhelming to me. The clearance room was busy and a mess, so I skipped that completely,. The cosmetics section is huge with every brand of makeup and perfume you can think of. The jewelry department is well stocked and well priced. And the purses, ohhhh the purses.... I had to walk through there VERY quickly so I wouldn't take some home with me. If parking in the deck near Belk, look above your head when you walk in to see what the sign says as to where you are parking - if you walk out the wrong door, it can be a bit confusing.

 Yeah, I bet all ya'll South Charlottans feel pretty cool, huh? Having the best Thai in Charlotte down there, floating around the perimeter like frickin' Pluto? 485, shmoreightyfive.

First signs of kickassness: bitter melon chunks, skewered and grilled, on the veg satay app. So maybe Julia Child knew how awesome hot Cukes can be (see: braised cucumbers, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, 1961) but the fact has escaped our collective palates since. Here's the bitter melon, all funny looking, spiny, sea urchin cuke, dipped in a molassessy sauce, grilled to translucency, making my frickin' day. Mushrooms were there too. Some tofu. Perfect. Then out comes the curry (they made it tongue-searingly hot, as requested) - and the best fried rice (full of veggies, more melon, smoky, salty, sweet, nutty) - and these noodles (if all Pad Thai tasted this awesome, Thai food snobs would quit snubbing the stuff) - and everyone's just smiling, stuffing their faces, kind of surprised, shoving it in like the oasis of really, really good food is about to vanish.

 As the newer, fresher twin of the Venetian, the Palazzo is also worthy of the same acclaim of it's predecessor. While one might not notice much differences between the two hotel, there are subtleties of Palazzo that distinguish it from the Venetian. First off, because it's a few years newer, the hotel rooms do have a more modern appeal and look. The layout of their rooms is pretty identical, but something about the Palazzo feels more modern. I believe it has to do with the colors, but I'm not an interior designer, so I can't give actual specifics. Another plus of the Palazzo is that Grand Lux Cafe is just downstairs and open 24/7! That means you can simply phone in an order and pick it up 20 minutes later in the separated cafe, or you can drop in and have an above average meal very conveniently. While Venetian also has it's own Grand Lux, I feel the Venetian one is more packed simply because it's ""closer"" to other attractions/hotels. The beds at the Palazzo are a legitimate competitor to my memory foam bed @ home; the plush mattresstop and sleek, silk sheets make sleeping in the bed extremely easy and comfortable. In the few occasions where I actually get to sleep in a bed, I wake up feeling refreshed, relaxed and ready to taint my mind & body w/ alcohol and late-night clubbing. One day I shall repeat this cycle of alcohol/ sleep on bed over a span of days and see how good I actually feel :) Lavo, the lounge/bar downstairs is apparently a nice place to chill and drink. While not exactly a place to dance your pants off, it is a convenient location for hotel guests to start the weekend off with some class, before your sweat smears off your makeup and your shoes end on your hands instead of your feet. I would recommend Lavo for those who don't like dancing/crowds and prefer just drinking and trying to socialize before the alcohol hits. When it does, you might as well move over to Tao (at the Venetian) where it's so dark and crowded no one will know the difference. So if you're stuck with a choice between Palazzo or Ventian, just flip a coin as it really doesn't matter too much. The Palazzo is easier to park in and exit since its entrance is off-the-strip slightly, so that's a plus. Walking to the Wynn is also closer than the Venetian, so if you wanted to go to XS / Encore Beach Club / Surrender, Ventian will make that walk of intoxicated, shameful walk back home all the shorter :) ",0,0,0,0,1

 I bought the Living Social deal and thought this would be something fun for my mom and I to do when she came into town. We walked in and confirmed our appointments and made our way to the tea bar. It is very modern and sleek inside and we were excited for our girls day to commence. After filling out our forms, drinking our champagne, we were still waiting. Finally 15 mins after the first appointment was scheduled, someone came to get us. The only problem was on the phone I specifically requested a female masseuse for my mom and I would have my appointment with the male. They had flip flopped our appointments and our forms, so once we had straighten that out, we were ready to enjoy our massages The hot towel treatment during the massage is the perfect way to transition to different parts of the body and at one point a cover was placed over my eyes to help block out any light, which was really helpful to me. I wish my masseuse wasn't as chatty as he was, but he was looking at my mom's form, and I am not sure if she checked she liked being talked to or not, so I won't hold it against them. It was my mom's first time getting a massage and she thoroughly enjoyed it. This place lives up to their reputation, and I will be back for another day of tranquility. ",0,0,0,1,0

 ~ $55 total including tax for one person on a Thursday evening. I loooove the selection of food here. I was not too happy about how salty a lot of the dishes were though, especially the seafood dishes. The oysters were fresh and sweet. They had stone crab claws that were not fresh and just tasted like... nothing... There is an area near the pizza and pasta (I know, weird that it's away from the seafood area) where you give the person a plate and theyll give you hot boiled snow crabs. The desserts were decadent. The molten lava cakes were a fail though, there was nothing oooozing out :( I actually went on 3 different occasions and it was like that every time. The gelato selection was bleh I went for the mochi icecream instead chocolate, green tea and mango.

 I have lived in Las Vegas for about 37 years and have patronized Calico Jack's for about 7 yrs now. I have given it so many chances because of the convenience of location and the nice sized dance floor. If you want to go to a place where the bartenders think that they run the place then by all means go to Calico's. My final straw was this past weekend when I threw a suprise birthday party for a friend and my husband. There was probably 15 people in the whole place along with the 15 that were in my party. We probably spent about $700 totaling food and alcohol. My two brothers and myself had went to the bar to order some drinks only to have the bartender walk away leaving us sitting there after we had ordered our drinks. His reason was because my brother ask for Hennesey, which he said that they did not have. My brother simply stated that he had never been to a bar that didn't have Hennesy in his 37 yrs of living in Las Vegas. The bartender informed him that he has worked at several Las Vegas bars that do not carry Hennesy. My other brother asked if there were another Conacs that we could get and the bartender informed him of another which my brother agreed to order then the bartender turned and left the bar area. We sat there for about 5 minutes then realized he was not coming back. At first I thought it was a racial thing because Hennesy is known to be a black man's drink but now that I thought about it, it was just the bartender.

 First time at this Filiberto's. Have always had good food and decent service at the others. This one was no exception. Arrived around 7:30PM on a Sunday night and I noticed that the place was different than all the others. This place had seating for about 40-50, salsa bar, condiment bar and chips/sauce bar. Nice touch. My wife ordered the rolled taco plate with all the toppings on the side. I got the Adobado plate but with no beans (date night ya know). She enjoyed her tacos. Crispy tortillas, flavorful meat and fresh toppings. The rice was exceptional, compared to other Fili B's. My Adobado was unctuous. It was juicy and seemed to have some extra flavor that I couldn't describe. My wife took a bite and wasn't fond of it but she also couldn't describe the taste. I recommend this Filiberto's for its savory dishes, good atmosphere and efficient service. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Was in PBurgh for a conference this week and stopped by this place for lunch in the Market District. I had the turkey Cuban and some red beans. I will have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Very tasty, fresh ingredients with a little kick. So much food. Seriously, go for the half sandwich. It was a ridiculous amount to eat. Service was great and fast- easily doable in an hour. Price was reasonable. A little jealous we don't have NOLA in Columbus. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The more I come here, the less I like it. My girlfriends know promoters for this club, or for some reason, we always end up here. I never really know why. The overall look is okay.... the setup isn't very well done or exciting, and it looks like a club you'd find anywhere else outside of Vegas. Most of us go to Vegas clubs for the over-the-top style, excess, and...... well, it's Vegas! This one doesn't have much to offer. We got unlimited drink tickets until 10, which entitled us to some cranberry juices or sprite with a few drops of vodka. Eventually, I felt sick from downing so much sugary liquid without feeling anything, so I stopped. There is NO PLACE to sit in this club unless you buy a table. You get yelled at for taking your shoes off, no leaning on the walls, no sitting on the floor. Whoever designed this club has never worn heels for a night out, I know, but everyone needs to sit at some point. I started taking breaks by sitting in the photo booth. Water bottles are EIGHT DOLLARS each and they won't give you tap water. I guess you could drink from the bathroom sink. I've said it in other reviews, but shouldn't any establishment that serves liquor to party-goers also have some sort of moral obligation to give those people water, too? The DJ was good and the go-go dancers could actually dance and were hot. They also showered the crowd with glow sticks and batons, and were great at getting the crowd into the party. This is the only reason why they get a second star. I know that most of these annoyances are typical of ANY club, but at least the other clubs have something special to offer. Haze does not, and for such a new, trendy, pretty hotel like Aria, I'm surprised. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We came here as a bachelorette party posse, after happy hour-ing in our room at the attached hotel, and having dinner at Ling and Louie's. There was no cover, but I believe we got there right at or just before 10p, which might have been why. I was surprised how packed this place (eventually) got. There was a scant crowd at 10ish. Early in the night my vodka/soda was $5, by last call it was $7 - I don't know if I got an unsolicited upgrade in vodka or if prices went up after a certain time. I'm by no means a club person so take the following criticisms for what that's worth, but this place was totally lifeless and utterly forgettable, by way of vibe, d \ u00e9cor and clientele. The crowd was bizarre - at a casino out on the res, that is to be expected. I surmised they were young folk (mid 20s singles looking to hook up, and edging on 30s married couples in groups who all got a babysitter for the night) who probably lived out in Maricopa and this was the closest club to hit up. (Let's face it, it's the closest anything). The layout is terrible. There is zilch seating and the dance floor is small. The only seating offered that isn't reserved tables (that require bottle service) is a padded bench in a raised up area. This area, which is also where most of the small, booth like tables are, has no view of the dance floor. Utterly stupid move. It feels like you're totally separated and closed off from the action. The bar is separated right in the middle by this raised up area, so on one side you stand at normal bar, the other side you are a giant, towering over the bartenders and bending oddly to collect your drink. Weird. The materials, angles and colors of the club made it seem like a cheesy spaceship set. DJ was ok, basic top 40s stuff with a few old jams from Outkast, MJ and Pharcyde thrown in the mix. But there were more than a handful of times he would put a song and the dance floor would just clear the hell out. But instead of get the hint and cut it early, he would ride it out. Bartenders were slow and inefficient. In the end, it was convenient and exactly suited our needs for the event: a bachelorette party. But if I had to get dragged out to a club again (yes, I am usually dragged) I would take a PCL or even a Martini Ranch over this place any day. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is a wonderful alternative to going on vacation at a fancy resort. The options are limitless and the attractions are many. There truly is something for everyone here. They have a kids area with rides from your elementary school carnival. You know the slide that takes off a layer of skin and shocks your ass all the way down? Also, the tilt-a-whirl, no doubt filled with sun-baked vomit. There is a petting zoo, and you can even feed and ride miniature livestock! You can buy a bird here, and even get a brazillian wax for $45 from a toothless woman. Dining options include pork rinds, funnel cakes, and snow cones. In all seriousness, it's only $2, the people watching is decent, they have beer, and you might find something cool.

 I came here back in late January and my friend raved about this place so, our friends all decided to have takeout here. We're ordered crab Rangoon, pad Thai, pad kee Mao, yellow curry chicken, fried rice, etc. I had a taste of everything and I was sooooooo disappointed with everything. I'm from SF and thai food here is amazing! I was really looking forward to eating this meal until I opened my box and the noodles were so different. It wasn't the wide flat noodles they serve in SF- it was thin flat noodles that were so bland that soy sauce didn't even help boost the flavor. The fried rice was nasty but the curry chicken was the best. I wished I had ordered that instead. The staff were nice enough to call us a cab and give us all the utensil and paper plates needed for our group. The restaurant was cleaned but at the hour of 5:00pm, there was no one dining there a all. ",1,0,0,0,0

 bought a Groupon deal for a massage and facial for $69. when i first bought the groupon, i assumed that the quality of the above services would be subpar because it was such an unbelievably amazing deal that it must be too good to be true. NOT AT ALL. when i went into the spa, which is very clean and nicely decorated, i was greeted by all 3 of the cheery receptionists. i also had to change the appointment time that day to 30 minutes later and they were very accomodating. i first had my facial with jenny. it was amazing! my skin looks and feels amazing, and jenny is a very friendly person who really loves what she does (not to mention, she's great at it!) next, i had a massage with tammy. she too did an excellent job. i tipped them both over 20% (well-deserved considering the price of the amazing groupon deal) although this place is very far from my home, i would definitely make the drive over there again because even without the groupon deal, their prices are very reasonable. highly recommend! great spa :) ",0,0,0,0,1

 This place mostly gets 4 stars for the atmosphere. It has a very old-school Vegas feel and it's open 24 hours. That alone makes this a great spot. There's a nice bar area and then a large restaurant area complete with old-school Vegas lounge singers during certain times. The atmosphere is just fantastic. Just dark enough, those great curved booths, waiters wearing ties, lots of families and couples, etc. The bread that each table automatically gets was delicious. Little square bites that were very buttery with some garlic. And served with a great red sauce for dipping (definitely not a marinara). We opted for pasta dishes, of course. The basic spaghetti with meat sauce and the salmon on a bed of penne pomodoro. I was a bit confused when no sides were offered for the spaghetti (even though it says it comes with one at the top of the menu). And then with the salmon, I was asked if I wanted pasta or a potato. Well, since it is supposed to be a pasta dish, why would I get the pasta? But alas, I didn't question it and didn't say anything when the food arrived - I had no pasta on my plate, just a piece of salmon and a baked potato. Thankfully, the salmon was delicious and cooked perfectly. And while basic, the spaghetti with meat sauce had a good flavor. The waiter was very nice and checked on us several times. And despite it being packed, we never felt rushed. This is definitely a place worthy of a repeat visit. Both a great place for a date and to take family visiting from out-of-town. ",0,0,0,1,0

 If you ever decide to come to Montreal for the first time and you don't know where you should eat and have no internet access to browse reviews of places, I strongly recommend you come to Dundees.

 I agree with the other reviewer that this Margiotta is not as good as the one nearby. It doesn't have the same character. It still remains a convenience store, but with another Margiotta nearby, and two Scotmids within proximity, one wonders just how convenient a shop needs to be. As with other Margiottas, the standard of food sold is on the whole pretty high. The trade off is that its more expensive. This is find for odds and ends like milk and bread (you won't notice much), but any sort of bulk shop and you'll begin to feel your wallet getting a touch lighter. However I do have to point out how the friendly the staff are. It didn't used to be the way, but whoever they have in operating the tills now are a helpful and particularly smiley bunch. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Wow expensive for Mexican food. I know, I know I was in Vegas and it should be expected. We (my husband and I) were in Vegas for a tradeshow. I had heard about El Segundo Sol through Yelp, Restaurant.com etc. So we decided to check it out one day for lunch. It was mid January but still nice out so we sat outside right by the sidewalk. That was a mistake, we sat down and within 5 minutes, a bird pooped on my husbands arm. No I'm not blaming the restaurant for this but it just didn't start off good. Waitress shows up to let us know about specials and takes drink orders. I order a special pomegranate something margarita for $10 and my husband orders a ""regular"" margarita off the menu at either $8 or $9... She brings them and okay I'm from Wisconsin and maybe my perspective on a $8-$10 drink is different but it was like a juice glass, like a baby juice glass. Talk about sipping, because I couldn't convince myself to pay for another at that price. We ordered the salsa trio and guac. Both were very tasty and plentiful. Seemed fresh, we got to order the guac in mild, medium or hot. I opted for medium and it did have some good flavors but not overpowering. I didn't find the prices that bad, $4 for chips and salsa, $10 for guac because it was good, fresh, plentiful. We both ordered the special lunch which was a trio of tacos (tuna, beef and chicken). I think each plate was $18 and came with rice and beans. Food was tasty but just so expensive for what was served. Also the wait to get the food seemed to take forever. My husband was digging into his rice and beans when low and behold... he found a hair. Sigh... Then he had more bird poop in his water glass which he almost drank (until it was almost up to his mouth) because he is not a refined sipper like me. I gotta hand it to him, he didn't loose his cool. He pushed his rice and beans aside and told the waitress very discreetly. She sent the manager over and they did compensate us for his meal, which they didn't have to do. I thought that was pretty stand up of them. Was the food quality good? Yes. Was it worth the $$, time waiting and pain in the butt? Nope. If anyone was dead set on going there I would tell them, get the quac, salsa and a bucket of beers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Never Returning First off the parking lot is atrocious the valet guys were probably the only positive about the whole experience. My girlfriend and I walked in and was told to have about a 20min wait, no problem that's standard. Our table was ready in about 10 which was great. We get seated look over the menu 5...10...15 mins pass by and we were not even greeted by a server. 2 other couples seated after us had drinks before we even met a waitress. My girlfriend asked one of the bus boys if we can see a server he replies with a very rude and monotone voice ""Working on it"". Another 10 mins pass by still no server. We promptly get up and leave. As we were leaving we pass by the same hostess that seated us and she says ""oh I guess they are leaving you can have that table"" to another couple just walking in. I promptly told the couple don't waste your time we never saw our waitress for 30 mins. I'm glad to see that I'm not the only yelper that thinks their ""wait"" staff is terrible. Wait being the key term in that phrase. This place would get zero stars if allowed ",1,0,0,0,0

 I think the food is delicious, especially the meatballs. Nom. The last time I was there, I was in the mood for something lighter so I opted for the buffalo chicken wrap. The wrap was good, but surprisingly hot... like hotter than ""hot"" wings at most restaurants. I actually had to stop eating because my mouth was on fire despite downing multiple classes of whatever beverage I was drinking. When it's busy, the cafeteria can get pretty unkept... seems like they don't have enough staff to keep up with the cleaning a lot of the time.

 I really do love coming here. They are attentive and the customer service is spectacular. The language barrier seems difficult but I promise you, if you give the employees of this family run business time, they will answer all your questions and treat you exceptionally well. Like any nail salon, do your research! Know what is on the market and what you want before you arrive; IE, types of gel and acrylics. This helps greatly. Get the callus remover. It's $5.00 more and worth every penny. Tell them which areas you want them to focus on too! Calves, heels, cuticles, etc! Only downfall IMO?

 Not a bad thing on the menu in my opinion. The selection also has many healthy alternatives which is important to me. This particular location I have dined at a few times now and the service is always good and they do an exceptional job of getting people in and out while maintaining a clean dining area. The patio area at this particular location isn't that impressive due to the fact, the only real view is Independence Blvd. so keep that in mind. And of course with all Panera Bread locations there's always the free wireless and in this day and age if a place doesn't have wireless connectivity that is a serious bummer for me. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My review is to supplement Anita I.'s review since we went together. WHERE DO I START?????????????? It is absolutely amazing that a brand new hotel will go through such great lengths to undermine any hopes you had of having a good time. You would think that they would have better service than all of the greats along the strip just to steal customers but, although this defies logic, this was simply untrue. So, I missed out on the argument...yes argument that the staff had with my friends in assigning a room to us because I got into Vegas late, so lucky for Aria. But my friends told me that this entire ordeal took quite a while and the end result? The manager miraculously was able to find a room with two queen beds. It is absolutely amazing the magic tricks that hotel managers can pull, isn't it? They should have a Vegas show of their own. Let's all try to get people to upgrade to a suite for $400 a night but if they don't agree, thennnnn we'll give them what they booked. Then my friends attempted to get into Haze...mind you it was pretty late already. So the girls got swept through a fast line but had to pay $20 each to get in. The boys on the other hand, were much luckier. They got to stand in line for an hour at the very front of the line before they were told that the rest of the line would not be getting in the club. And they didnt' even have to pay to stand in line for an hour, how about that. Oh but wait a minute, you COULD get in!!! For the right price! The Haze people began to ask each party whether they would want VIP passes to get in the club. When my friends asked how much the VIP passes are, they replied, you name a price and we'll tell you if it's too high or too low. My question to them would be....is $1000 too high? I mean is there really going to be a number that's too high? The girls inside the club were experiencing something similar. The go-go dancers were straight holding up dollar bills and pointing at them, asking guys to tip them. I understand that City Center was going through tough times and was almost unable to be completed but this is going a little far. After this amazing experience, my friends went to speak to the management at the hotel and expressed their dissatisfaction in the club. The management insisted that the club had nothing to do with the hotel and that they were unable to control the way Haze was run. Understandable. Nonetheless, Haze is the primary club in Aria and yes, people do associate clubs with hotels. XS -- Wynn/Encore, Tao -- Venetian. Amazing -- Amazing. So they offered first round of drinks at Gold Lounge. I mean at this point it was 1 AM and I'm sorry a round of drinks just wouldn't do to alleviate the anger of standing in line for an hour with no avail. Finally, after much persuasion, they gave buffet comps. We were able to end the night on a much happier note after that. Other than that, the staff there was quite poorly trained. They all have attitude when addressing customers. This started with the valet, who just stared at us when we drove up. We had to say hi to them to get service. Amazing. I was asking for directions from one of the staff members. He had to finish listening to his earpiece before he said to me, ""Go ahead."" Like...WOW. Okay thank you for letting me wait my turn and allowing me to go ahead with my question now. Nothing like, ""how may I help you, miss."" The hotel was absolutely gorgeous though. It was like....going to Hong Kong or somewhere in Asia. Looming skyscrapers and glass everywhere. The lobby was a modernistic look along with the casino. Everything smelled very new. The hallways smelled like new carpet, not necessarily a good thing. Our room was very well put together and the room service provided turn down service without request. Everything can be controlled with a touch of the controls on the nightstand so that was pretty fun. I mean this included turning on and off the lights in the bathroom while your friends were in there. The alarm clock was very fun also! As we discovered at 10:45 AM when our curtains started opening, all the lights turned on and the TV turned on to the jazz channel. After gambling, we went to the City Cafe. I had the corn chowder, delicious with a kick to it! I also had steak and eggs which was pretty good. My boyfriend had mac & cheese. All quite delicious. We had four people and the bill totalled $100, no drinks. But, it still was quite delicious. Aria's buffet...was quite tasty. With $5 extra, there is unlimited champagne. The staff dropped two plates while we were there and they were quite responsible. They had security come over immediately to make sure no one was walking through the area and they cleaned it up immediately. Aria needs to step up its game if it wants to compete with the big boys. Customer service...let's say gets a 0. If you don't have to interact with the hotel staff, then I'd say it's a 3.5. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I'm a regular here with my girlfriend at least a few times per month. I like original fish tacos and she usually orders the skinny tacos which are wrapped in lettuce instead of a corn tortilla. I think they only have 110 calories each or something. The service is always great! When we sit in the dine in side Rosie is usually working. She is so nice and sweet and very patient when we have trouble making up if we want tacos or something different. Sometimes at night Andrew works and he is very nice and helpful and offers great service. We've visited serval times after midnight and the bartender Brian is very friendly and offers great service. He try's to up sale the drinks or Dessert but you expect that from any good server/bartender. They are always quick to refill your drinks or take your plates away once you are done..

 The 2nd star is for being open so late. The food is overpriced and not good at all. Meats were fatty and too well done. The shu Mai was not edible. To further annoy me, not only were all the BBQ meats fatty and too tough to eat, when I was starving, but I was asked when I ordered if I would like rice with it? I assumed in typical Chinese restaurant style this meant it came with it so I said yes and was then charged $4.25 for it. Are you kidding me? The shrimp dumplings were the only thing that was good.

I had a particular instance with a waitress today at lunch where we tried to tell her how to pay the ticket - ""This $20 bill is for this item and this item"" and ""This green card pays for this item and this item."" etc etc. It's a pain, and confusing. But she messed it up, and that was not unexpected considering the policy they have to go by. But then when we got it back and tried to explain the problem to her, she got a little snippy. Then got a little attitudinal. Love the food. But this ""one check per party"" policy really brings the place down, and causes the servers and customers both some grief. Not good. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Here's how a 1-star shopping plaza gets 4 stars. So it's New Years day last month and we were just finishing up our brunch, bloodies, and a session of watching bowl games at the Grapevine. A small army of us decided on an impromptu day drinking pub crawl in old town. It was 70 degrees and a perfect day to stroll. The only problem was my lady friend (from out of town) left her tennies in the room. She only had pumps and her dogs were already barkin from the long night preceding. So off to Salties they went. She and I left on a mission to locate some sandals. I thought snatching up a pair of flip flops would be a no-brainer at Sidewalk Surfer. Little did I remember that is was New Years Day. Everyone was closed, even Triangles. After 2 laps around old town, it looked like it was going to be either the pumps, cowboy boots from one of those awful turquoise stores, or she would have to man up and rock the grocery store feet. None of those options sat well with her (I could've handled the pumps, but I absolutely despise dirty feet). I made one last ditch effort and drove down to Southbridge area. I only saw one door open at a place called the Garage Boutique. On a hunch we stuck our necks in and said hello. Katie, the owner, informed us that she was closed, just doing some admin work or inventory, but offered us to peek around. Took us about 15 seconds to figure out it was another swing and miss! It was a children's boutique. She saw the dismay on our faces and had to ask ""what are you looking for"". I gave her the 5-sec version with hopes she could point us in the right direction. To our surprise, she leaned down, grabbed her own pair of sandals and gave them to Lindsey (aforementioned lady friend). No joke, they were even the right size. She said to bring them back when we can. SCORRRE!! I couldn't believe it. Such a solid find. I offered her money and she wouldn't take it. I even offered to bring her some bagels or a bento box from Kyoto (I think that creeped her out a bit haha). I was 2-3 drinks deep and we were fired up at this point. So we went about our day...yada yada yada. Needless to say we had a great day thanks to a genuine person helping us out. The moral of this long rant is that Katie is the shit! Her boutique is full of cute kids stuff: clothes, all sorts of fresh gear, mother-loving accessories, trinkets, and the like. Not only does this boutique have some great pint-size threads, but its owner is a enormous sweet heart, life saver, and obviously has great taste. If you have children, make sure to drop in. You won't be dissappointed with the service! p.s. I only mention the 1-star because most of the tenants & shops are gone. If you see any shops in the Mix are open, they are definitely worth a looksie. Thanks again Katie! ",0,0,0,1,0

 We always enjoy our meals at Stripsteak. I have been having a run of bad luck ordering steak recently, so it was nice to get a good chunk of prime ribeye cooked perfectly to medium rare. My wifes filet came to the table ""still mooing"" just as she likes it. The mac and cheese was excellent and plentiful. The scallion potato cakes weren't quite as good as previous visits, but still above average. We tried the lobster fritters on recommendation. They were tasty, but a bit overwhelmed by the bacon. I dipped some of the house fries into the creme fraiche that came with the fritters and it was excellent. They should consider offering that up as a regular option. Overall, it was another excellent meal from Michael Mina. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I ate here last night with a dining partner. Having read many of the reviews on this site we went early on a Tuesday evening and were seated in one of only two empty tables. We had thought about getting reservations but the hours that came with my gift card said No Reservations. The decor of the restaurant was very nice. They had copper tables in a cramped type of environment that is very European. We decided to forgo appetizers this day and instead got drinks. I had something that resembled a manhattan while my dining partner had the Bellini and both were good. Since my dining partner and I both ordered entrees we were served with a dinner salad. It was one of the nicer salads that I have had with Gorgonzola, sunflower seeds and chick peas amongst the greens and a nice vinaigrette paired with it. For dinner I had the pumpkin ravioli while my dining partner had the porcini gnocchi. The pumpkin ravioli was absolutely delicious although only receiving 5 for the price that was paid was a bit disappointing. The gnocchi was much more substantial though and just as tasty. For dessert we had the lemon cake which was fantastic and came with fresh raspberries and blackberries as a garnish. When all was said and done it was by far some of the best food that I have tasted recently and all of my concerns from previous posts were undone with the service being great and having no wait for our table. The bottom line for me is that this restaurant had wonderful food and not too high of a price point and I will definitely be back. I would recommend that you go early on a weekday though as the seating is very limited. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Had heard a lot of people mention this over the last couple years in Charlotte, so a friend and I (who had also never been to this place) decided to try it for lunch on a weekday. I met her there and the place was typical of a bar/pub. The back patio looked nice and large, which is where I've heard it's really chill to drink out back during the summer, but as this was a cooler day in Charlotte (high 30's), this was not so appealing. The staff was helpful and friendly and pretty attentive, so this was clearly not what caused me to give them 2 stars. It was the food. I had a burger w/ fries and my friend had a BLT w/ fries. It's not that it wasn't cooked properly or wasn't decent, it's just that it wasn't anything special and when it comes to bar/pub food in Charlotte, there certainly are other places that are much, much better. All in all, it felt more like a bar/pub restaurant chain more than a neighborhood hangout and I was certainly expecting more. Like I said, it might be a cool bar to hang out during the summer, but not a restaurant that should necessarily be sought after. I'll probably give it another chance if someone wanted to go there, but won't be convincing my friends to go have a meal there. ",0,1,0,0,0

 For a Michelin rated restaurant It didn't meet my expectation. I guess I don't know what expensive food should taste like. We did the 5 course tasting and a couple of appetizers because we knew the five course meal wasn't going to be enough food. And No, we are not big people and not overweight. Actually my wife and I are HOT! : ). The waiter warned us that it will be too much food but we didn't believe him. He was right! The tuna tartare was bland and the lobster pot pie was decent. My favorite two dishes were the Foie Gras and the desserts. The foie gras melted in my mouth and all the desserts were excellent. We were so stuffed that we had to be rolled out of there. Bill came to $350.....OUCH! Luckily I won 1g at the poker table that day. whew! Food: 3 stars Service: 4 stars Atmosphere: 3.5 stars ",0,0,1,0,0

 4 stars for the food (well, maybe 3.5), but 0 for service, which reached the ""holy hell how is it so bad?"" territory. Literally every single dish ordered, all the way down to the post-meal cappuccino, was given to the wrong person. How does that happen? Unless our server has dyscalculia, I just don't see how it's possible (though if he did, I feel kinda bad, though maybe he could've said something?). Further, we were either in ""smother with upsell"" mode or ""quietly ignore"" mode throughout the meal. Coup de grace was asking for a wine bottle recommendation under $70 and being told he couldn't recommend anything. Really? Then either (1) don't have them on the menu or (2) lie. But please, don't (3) make us feel cheap at your 3x-4x markup of some mediocre-to-begin with wine offerings. Completely offensive. My meal was the curry-cauliflower soup (nice taste, a good amount of heat, but a little unfulfilling) and the duck confit salad. Not *great* confit, but not bad. Wouldn't recommend it unless you really really are in the mood and have not-too-high expectations. Montreal has way too much good food and service to return here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 After living in Vegas for a short time, I've made it. No, I didn't become the headliner for a show on the strip. I made it to a baseball game. I attended the 51s game for a Yelp CMYE outing, and I couldn't be happier with the experience. I didn't know any of the players, or anything about the teams. I just wanted to come out and hang out with my yelp friends, and have a good time. Having said all that, I do watch baseball, but just not at the AAA level. The game atmosphere is nice. Concessions are cheapish. Bathrooms are clean, and I had one hell of a time with my friends. My advice to you? Try to pay attention to the ball as it is being batted. You don't want to be THAT GUY who gets beaned in the head because he wasnt paying attention. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I decided to check this place out after a friend commented about how good the Thai food was here. I went in and the decor is just what I would expect if I was going to Thailand and sitting down at a nice restaurant. Staff was friendly and not pushy. Ordered the Panang Chicken Curry and crab ragoons. The ragoons were tasty, not overcooked nor normal Chinese ragoons. Spices were added to the cream cheese and the outside had a crispy crust that went well with the sweet sauce on the side for dipping. The curry came with a side salad with a little more than necessary ginger dressing. The curry was served on a large bed of sticky rice and the sauce was not too spicy or bland. Very delightful array of veggies- carrots, potatoes, and onions; but the large basil and bay leaves left in the dish forced me to remove them prior to digging my spoon in. Overall, I hope to return to try some of the other dishes. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Hot and Sour Soup and Shanghai Noodles totaled $20.43. Despite the inflated pricing, I thoroughly enjoyed the noodles.

 This was my first dinning experience at this restaurant and I'm sorry to report that chances are slim to none that I will ever return. The service was average at best, wait time was much slower than it should be. The champagne arrived warm and it took over 20 minutes for it to get to an acceptable chill. I had to ask the waiter to please bring more ice since when we complained that it was warm and they didn't respond. We shared the foie gras and it was extremely small for $20 and the toast served with it was so heavily drenched in butter it overpowered the taste. We had to ask for plain bread instead. We then had the salmon entree and a side order of the mac n cheese. Very nice flavor and we left feeling satisfied. However, around 5 hours later, we both started experiencing stomach cramps and diarrhea. This went on all night long. I wasn't happy about spending $180 for dinner and getting sick, so the next morning I called to tell management our experience. I wasn't sure what to, but I thought they should know. She spoke to me very courteously, but basically said, ' they checked all their food for expiration, and no one else complained"". This reaction annoyed me. I feel at the very least an apology was in order and perhaps offer of something on our next visit, anything! This is very poor customer service and I will not return there again. There are too many places for fine dinning here, i don't have to patronize an establishment that is not concerned about my comfort or satisfaction. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Not a bad place for a quick meal. While wandering downtown the other night looking for a place to grab a light meal, my friends and I decided to try Diamond Market bar and Grill. The place doesn't look like much from the outside, or inside for that matter. There is a bar area and a restaurat area. There were several televisions that could be seen on both sides. The menu consistented of some typical bar type foods with a few stand outs. I decided to go with a bowl of their chicken dumpling soup to warm me up on a cold night while my husband went with the burger sliders with fries. The soup was excellent! I actually wish I had some of it right now. I could tell that it was home made by the chunks of white meat and some dark meat chicken. The dumplings were sooo soft and fluffy! I also had the opportunity to nibble on some of my husbands fries which were thin and crispy, just how i like 'em. He also thought his sliders were juicy which seems to be difficult for most places. All in all, worth a try if you are looking for a quick meal downtown. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Unfortunately, 3 stars is pushing it. We had high hopes due to the several positive ratings from other users and word of mouth. We started with the Local Greens salad, and it was just that - greens with with a light dressing and a few kalamata olives on the side. We also ordered the margherita pizza with fresh basil, mozzarella and the fennel sausage. The pizza came out of the brick oven crispy.... but black around the entire top crust, and the bottom was covered in black spots. It had a distinct burnt aftertaste. We started in on a piece, but soon notified the staff of the issue. They were extremely understanding and promptly took the burnt pizza away. They immediately put in an order for another one, and it came out very quickly. Still a bit blackened on parts of the crust, but better than the first time around. I will say the toppings were excellent - fresh mozzarella and leaves of fresh basil with very tasty fennel sausage. Overall, the atmosphere was very trendy and pleasant, but the food just didn't win us over, especially for the price tag. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Came here with my Family for the first time a few weeks ago. I was definitely not impressed. We sat in the section where you get to grill your own food, ordered just about every type of meat on the menu as it was four of us, we were hungry, and we wanted to try everything. I honestly cant remember one thing that I thought was good. The meat was so bland and tasteless! The sides were not very good either. It could be that I am just not used to this type of food but in my opinion it was not very good at all. Mind you I was HUNGRY when I went here. My family did not care for it either and we all agreed we would most likely never return. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I really like the food here, but consistently the service is atrocious. The servers are rude from the get go as if you are bothering them by just being there. Several examples: the restaurant only had two other couples seated, so when a friend popped in and we asked if we could get a 5th chair for the table, we were told a manager would have to approve it (this took several minutes as the manager was out smoking). My boyfriend and I both ordered bloody Mary's at brunch, but I was brought a tequila sunrise. As someone with lots of experience in the service industry, I immediately and very politely asked to have the drink I ordered. She took the sunrise away, did not return with a bloody, didn't apologize, and charged us for 2 bloodys and the sunrise. I sat at the bar once waiting for a table and the bartender told me he does not transfer checks to the waitresses because he doesn't get the tips then. The food is amazing, but don't expect the service to be prompt or polite. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I guess you have to try this out if your not from Pittsburgh! I had the sweet sausage, Hubs had hot sausage, my oldest had ham and my youngest ordered chicken fingers. The chilli was good, but the bread it came w/ was stale. They put cole slaw and french fries on the sandwiches. I thought that it just made the sandwiches bland and starchy. But not bad...just blah. The bread was nice and soft and they have several different kinds. I am not a beer drinker, but they looked like pretty good prices. The place was very crowded and you seat yourself. We lucked up on an empty table, although it was by the door. The place looks much bigger on the outside. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Not memorable. We called ahead to see if they offered a tasting and we were told YES! So when we showed up at our reservation, the server said he'd have to check with the chef and said he thinks it was okay. Since I understood that tasting menus can be a pain if they are not offering it to the whole restaurant, we said it was not a problem and we'd just order off regular menu. He insisted that it was fine and so we proceeded... From the amuse bouche, everything was OFF. The food wasn't what the food runner told us it was, flavors were odd, some over cooked, under/over seasoned courses. It was a mess. Has a pretty view of the strip, but that's about it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 A great new addition to the DeMarco family of ventures. This was a pre-opening tasting, so they're still working on all of the fine points. Nonetheless, it is a terrific spot. The structure itself is very appealing, as they restored a 1940's-era building and exposed its beautiful brickwork, which is complimented with a stained concrete floor. The bar is a proper one with a wide array of liquors and fairly ample seating for the size of the space. The patio definitely will be the preferred seating choice so long as the weather cooperates. We tried macaroni and cheese as well as the cole slaw starters; for $3 each, you could make a delicious, reasonably-priced meal from a collection of the starters. The double dip starter (cobb dip and posole salsa with chips) was very good, though I almost preferred the dip and salsa without the chips because they're so flavorful. The mixed grain salad was a good choice, too, though I might try to find something other than the orange vinagrette to put on it. The wine on tap was tasty, and they'll also have a small list of about 8 bottles. Again, the official opening isn't until the 25th, so they're still honing the fine edges. In any event, we'll be there far too often for our own good! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was pretty excited to come here. I have been recently diagnosed with celiac disease. They have gluten-free health food, and a LOT of it is vegan. This restaurant specializes in working with food allergies but apparently does not specialize in ""flavor"". I love healthy food. Chakra 4 is one of my favorite restaurants, and I love healthy, fresh veggies in their raw form! But they have food that is yummy. If I wanted rabbit food with balsamic vinegar, well... I could do that! I got the Kitchen Sink salad (had greens, carrots, chickpeas, black beans, jicama, broccoli, mango, and candied walnuts that weren't candied.) that sounded good, but was okay. The roasted butternut squash appetizer quite honestly was the most boring thing I've ever eaten. I sampled my fianc \ u00e9's food and it mostly tasted like allspice and not much else (he got the quinoa salad, wild rice, and southwestern soup). All I could smell was allspice - I think. It was something pungent. Truly disappointed. I probably won't prioritize going back there, but I'm willing to give it another shot. Yawn. ",0,1,0,0,0

 One of those places that should only serve water and vinegar at the bar... ...Why you ask? Cause they're a bunch of DOUCHES !!!! My wife and I were invited guests.. Our host made a reservation a few days in advance for a Saturday night party of 18 people. They said they could accommodate us, NO PROBLEM. ""No problem?"" ""No problem!"" ...No problem my wasabe right testicle. We get to the restaurant and are immediately surprised, they have separated us into two tables. Kind of interesting cause our host didn't remember making a reservation for two tables of nine, it was supposed to be one table of 18. What the fuck happened to ""No problem"" ?? Our host originally agreed, a party of 18 people, price fixed menu. Okay, we were fine with that, we understood it was a big party... But, if you're going to break us into two smaller parties than why can't we order off the regular menu? ""You can't order off the menu because it will slow down the kitchen."" ""So what happens when you have two separate parties of nine come in? Do they have to have a price fixed menu too?"" ""No!"" ""Well, if you're not going to sit us together like you said you would, remember, NO PROBLEM?? Then we expect to be able to order off the regular menu.."" ""I'm sorry, we can't do that..."" ""No, we're sorry for your inability to deliver a table as promised and then not being accommodating to your customers... Well take our $2500 elsewhere..."" 18 people got up and left.. Thanks for the shitty Sake! And if you read this whole review, be smart, go to Tao. Oh yeah, forgot one thing..

 short version: He said she said... corporate says the store lied, the store says corporate lied. :( ""Free"" home delivery is definitely a painful experience. Long version: So I go in there, just lookin at desks. One's on sale, I kinda like it, and sale ""ends today."" Blah blah, but i'm on my sport bike so I'm obviously not strapping the desk to my back and riding home. So working with the manager (bill), he says, no problem free delivery! I said wow, how's that work? He said comes locally, 1-3 days, and ur buying it on saturday 1-3 days makes it Wednesday. And they'll call you in advance with a 4 hour window before they come to deliver it. Oh no problem! Sounds great! Then the lying manager says, ""oh and call them monday morning to make sure everything is good."" So I call monday morning. Apparently it's kinda more like a UPS delievery kinda thing. The do *NOT* call in advance and give you a 4 hour window. They come by and leave a note on your door if you're not home and try 3 times and then it goes back. WHOA! WTF, not as described!!! And you kinda have to be home for 96 hours straight or it ain't gonna work!!! ... so Thursday comes and goes, and it's not here yet! So I call up the 800 # again. The 800 # rep, great gal, listens to my story and she puts me on hold to call the store. Talks to the manager. She ends up putting in a complaint with the store.

 I have eaten her many times. Service is generally pretty good. Food is really good. Went in just before noon on Memorial day and took 10 mins to get seated, it wasnt that busy. the girl asked how many and if we wanted the patio. We requested patio she said let me check to see if theres a clean table. She came back in and instead of seatting us she picked up her food that was ready to go and served it and took care of another table. She then came over to us and greeted us again and asked inside or outside. We requested outside again she said I only have a high top, told her that would be fine. We were seated and sat there for almost 20 mins and the server and busser in that area came out multiple times but never greeted us or asked for a drink order. Went down the street. We may give it another shot but for the amount of staff I saw and the number of customers this is not acceptable ",0,1,0,0,0

 We throughly enjoyed our experience at Tupelo Honey. This has only been open for a few weeks, but there were no signs of that at our meal. The service was excellent, taking care of our needs but not overwhelming us with constant attention. The food was wonderful. My wife throughly enjoyed her Charleston chicken sandwich. I had the steak au poivre and loved every bite. The quality of the steak was outstanding and it was cooked to perfection. And the mac & cheese was, in a word, incredible. I would marry this mac & cheese. I wanted to go to other tables and ask if they had any leftover mac & cheese I could finish off. We will definitely be back for more! ",0,0,0,0,1

 This past Saturday I had dinner in the Meat Packing District in Manhattan! Oh no I am mistaken - actually I was right here in Phoenix at a fantastic little place called St. Francis. Forgive my confusion, but I as I sat in this architectural joy with exposed brick, glass, inside out side bar, and the much talked about pulley suspended loft, I could not help to think i must not be in Phoenix. Turns out I was and make no mistake this place is must more than just a pretty face. Although not a very large menu - several items called to me from the page - so we let the server do the driving for us. The goat cheese app was a perfect beginning, and as we were about 3 crostinis short on the cheese to bread balance, our server was quick to bring a few more, so that precious cheese would not go to waste. My wife had the Seafood soup which was absolutley a joy. Even good restaurants these days fall short of truly inspired flavor and this dish loaded with fresh seafood in a delicate yet savory broth was just amazing. It had a personality all its own familiar yet a little exciting at the same time. For me it was the Pork chop with the finest polenta I have every had. If there is a filet mignon of pork chops this was it. Since my wife is having a baby any minute now I had a glass of Tempronillo which I thought was nice option on a wine by the glass list. We finished off with a simple but perfectly done apple-crisp ala mode. After our meal we sat back with the quite satisfaction and grin of the chesire cat. Nothing needed to be said we were in culinary paradise. If that is not enough - the real magic of this place is the synergy of it all. The food is amazing, the room has snap, but it all comes together with a diverse crowd unassuming yet hip (I hate that word). A lovely group of four older people, next to my wife and I, sharing the energy with a young couple certainly on their first date and 4 ladies out for the evening. Yes we all know Phoenix is growing and getting better every day, but this place is forcing its hand. The city was alive and vibrant and best of all real , in this little masterpiece. This is the kind of place I want to be a regular at - not because I want to be known there, but because I want to get to know it better. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Overall, this place was top-notch. Service was phenomenal. Our server took really good care of us, very knowledgeable of the menu with some great recommendations. Ambient was filled with energy flowing, fun, laid back with a modern southwestern, chic feel. Commenced with some refreshing, ""healthy"" cocktail - Bloody Orange Margarita, made fresh using real fruit with no sugar. So good I ordered another. Most of the drinks looked really good. For the apps or botanas (as they call it), we had Duck Carnitas Empanadas, Pork Belly Pibil,and Almejas Al Vapor. We ordered 2 of each as we wanted to share among the group. I would have to say I enjoyed every single one of them. NOW, the foie gras that came with the Empanadas, I thought was a little overdone so therefore dry. Foie gras usually is softer and juicier with balanced flavor. For the main entree, we had this tender Pork Shoulder that came with Tortilla complemented with a nice sweet, tangy sauce to drizzle over. Oh wow, just amazing. The meat was soo tender that you just peeled it right off. Desert - Pumpkin Bread Pudding, pretty good. A little too sweet, but good. I would definitely return for some more deliciousness!

 I recently went to Arpino Trattoria on the recommendation from a friend from work. I had just recently returned from a trip from Italy, and I can sincerely say that the food rivaled the food I ate while abroad. The restaurant is small and intimate. The chef came out to check how our meals were, and the other patrons seemed to be having a great night out. Altogether, the entire experience was one I'd recommend to anyone! Enjoy! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I absolutely LOVE this sushi place! I'm visitng my family in Arizona and being a huge sushi fanatic, they brought me to Masa and I am NOT disappointed! The sashimi was fresh and the pieces were SO full and large. Some sushi places only put a small sliver on their sushi pieces, but Masa put very, VERY generous pieces in and on all their sushi pieces. Definitely recommend this place- love it! PS. Sorry if this review is a little too happy and ridden with grammatical mistakes. I just love Masa too much. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Eight of us went to Manuel's today for lunch, and I can say that the service was the WORST I have ever seen in any restaurant. Six of us got our meals at the same time, while the other two (who ordered the daily special) got theirs EIGHT MINUTES AFTER the rest of us. We didn't see the server again until he brought our bill. We had asked him for separate tickets...and only got one. We never got a single refill on the iced teas that four of us paid $2.50 each for...ten bucks would buy a LOT of tea bags. An 84-year-old woman in our party asked for her water in a styrofoam cup with a straw, which the server said he would bring her but he never did. The food was unimpressive...greasy and fried. I would go to Taco Bell before I went back to Manuel's, which is overpriced. I wouldn't have minded the mediocre food, but the service sucks like an Electrolux. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Hands down the best Buffet I tried in Vegas (by a long shot) - and at $32 per person pretty reasonable- come on folks it's Vegas! We got there early which was great since there seems to be quite a line otherwise. I thought the carving stations were by far the best! All of the meat was cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection! The salads actually are quite delicious too- and usually that's something I steer clear from in a buffet- but don't miss out! Desserts were excellent - my favorite being the Tiramisu. What to avoid: Cold crab legs :/ Ugh! What a disappointment, I usually love crab legs and I do not want them served on ice or re-heated for that matter. This alone was reason for minus one star. The sushi was also not very delicious. They had some sashimi which was a little mushy but I can't complain a lot here because I don't think sushi stands much of a chance when served buffet-style. ",0,0,0,1,0

 So. This is the next best thing to my mommy's home cooking [which is currently 500+mi away :(]. Souflaki (lamb shish kabob) was soooo good! They cooked it exactly how I asked. The fries that come with it would super good for some reason...pretty sure fries aren't a Greek specialty haha. Tiropitas (cheese pies) were pretty good. Nothing to write home about, but I'm too lazy to cook I'll definitely pop in here for a couple orders! Service was good. Casual dining but good food and reasonable prices. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The open space, large ceiling to floor windows, and bright area gives this library a welcoming vibe. The layout is spread out and provides many great places to study in the open or in secluded rooms. The book store and vending areas is the perfect space to allow teens to hang out with their friends and not disturb the other patrons. The garden display is beautiful, using many common items that would normally be trashed, giving new life to old rubbish. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Went here to get my mother's car smog checked. It's just around the corner from our house, so that right there was a huge advantage to going here. I drove right up, got everything done in less than 10 minutes, was able to pay by credit card, AND got a CD out of it; for those scoring at home, it was a Los Tigres del Norte CD (East LV por vida!). Easily the most stress free transaction I've ever had involving a car. If you're ever in need of a smog check and you're on the far east side of town, hit up Nate's. ",0,0,0,0,1

Believe me, we came hungry & left very happy with leftovers! I'm taking a star off because of the server we had, she seemed to be distracted, or maybe didn't want to serve us?

 I stopped in for lunch today on a whim. Their lunch specials are extremely reasonably prices and I enjoyed the Bipim Rice (very similar to traditional bipimbop) a lot. Plus, when I asked for the meat to be left off, they subbed eggs instead (instead of making me pay for the additional side). Overall I very much enjoyed my lunch experience and look forward to coming back for dinner (much more extensive menu - yum)! ",0,0,0,0,1

 My scallops were luke-warm yet overcooked. The carrots on my salad looked like they had been sitting in the bottom of a fridge for weeks.

 This place is AMAZING! Their pork shoulder might just be the best thing I've ever eaten! When I first took a bite, I thought I had died and gone to heaven it was so good! First of all, the sauce complimented the pork really well. It was a great balance of sweet and salty with a little bit of tangy-ness. Second of all, the pork itself. There aren't words to describe it. It was juicy, flavorful, and tender. I've had a lot of pork that was dry and overcooked, but this one was complete perfection! Sure, the service was a little slow, but it was very crowded, and once I had a bite of that pork shoulder, all my annoyance at the wait vanished! This one dish almost made me wish I lived in Las Vegas so I could have it more often! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Regardless of my age, I will always love Disney. Every time I see a Disney store while out on vacation, I have to go! Now that I have a kid I even have more reasons to go! The Disney outlet is great, they have a ton of similar stuff you would find at a regular Disney store, except discounted! On our visit there, my daughter was feeling a little under the weather so I thought a trip here would cheer her up, they had a ton of sales on shirts.. $3-5 dollars on kids characterized t-shirts..2.99 for tumbler cups for the kiddies, and a sale on their plates and such.. they had a ton of sale racks for clothing in the back of the store, along with more sale items against the walls..this put a big smile on my face along with the baby girl! Their plush toys weren't really that much of a sale to me.. I think over in the bay area they go for 2 for 25 or something? Over here they go for 2 for $28, only a 3 dollar difference..haha but I love bargains! I did find a really cute Oswald the rabbit plushie.. I haven't seen in any of the Disney Stores I been too..

 My friend loves South Coast Hotel and Casino because she wins here! She plays the penny slot machines and wins hundreds of dollars on them! (Hundreds of dollars on a penny machine! My gawd!) She got a handy coupon booklet from them when she signed up for their card (I think). We decided to take advantage of their Buy One Get One Free Buffet coupon for lunch on a Saturday. There's nothing particularly fancy about this buffet like the big hotels on the strip. It's a newer hotel though and it's buffet is decent. And with these prices, it's a better deal than going out to eat. Why the two star then? Well, I was eating this one dessert dish and had a weird feeling about it. I told my friend, if I'm in the bathroom in less than half an hour, it's because of this dessert. Well...lo and behold, less than fifteen minutes from leaving that restaurant, I had to find the ladies' room. Yep, my lunch was making an exit! Overall, everything else was fine. Service was standard and the food was okay. But when one little item gets you running for the toilet, it's never fun. Blah! Breakfast (Monday - Saturday): 7am - 10am $6.45 Lunch (Monday - Saturday): 11am - 3pm $7.45 Dinner (Sunday - Thursday): 4pm - 9pm $12.95 Dinner (Friday & Saturday): 4pm - 10pm $12.95 Brunch (Sunday): 8am - 3pm $11.95 Monday Steak Night: 4pm - 9pm $13.95 Wednesday Seafood Night: 4pm - 9pm $16.95 Updated! 07/30/07 - I went here a couple of weeks ago on a Friday night. They were offering 50% off the buffet with your movie stub, and we had just returned from watching Transformers. It's seafood night, so the price was about $16.95/pp, but what a steal when you get half off. The BF was craving some snow crab legs and I noted oysters on the half shell. We both gorged on those two alone, and maybe with some shrimp, and when we did finally check out what else they offered, it was sad to see that there really wasn't much else. They were out of spoons, bowls, etc., and it didn't matter where you checked on the buffet line, they just didn't have any! Even the soft serve machine was breaking down when I was there. Overall, there's not much going on in this buffet. Yes, there's a line to be seated, but I think it's because everyone had a coupon of some sort too. (And can you really complain when your buffet meal is less than $9/pp?) ",0,1,0,0,0

 My husband and I travel to Las Vegas about 4 times a year from Seattle. Easy flights, lots of choices. We love to stay at the Encore and or The Wynn. Those hotels are the top of the top for sure. We like to play Pai Gow but the Encore only has ONE Pai Gow table and its frustrating because you cannot always get a seat. We happened upon the Aria casino last time we were in Vegas. They have an entire Pit of Pai Gow tables. This time we decided to stay at the Aria hotel. Here are my pros and cons on this particular property. Because Its new, the casino is clean and you cannot smell the smoke at all! The ventilation system is amazing! There are LOTS of tables and slot machines to choose from. The Dealers are nice and very fun to play with. There are a lot of different restaurants and cafe's in this hotel. You can get just about anything. They have a new ""players"" card system that gives you points on EVERYTHING! So be sure to give it to the dealers, use it in the slot machines and show it to every restaurant and shop you go too, so that the points will add up. And as the points add up you can even use them for shopping in the high end shops. As your points add up you will get a different colored card to show that you are basically a High roller, VIP, etc. You can use those points for the room, food anything. The rooms were nice, a bit smaller than we are used too from Palazzo and Encore but still nice. And the BED OH MY! It was so wonderful! We had a great view of the strip and it was fun to just sit and watch the lights at nite while having a late nite cocktail. This hotel is pretty much in the heart of the strip, so you can get to any other hotel, show, restaurant, shopping, etc. easily. There is a tram that will take you back and forth to Bellagio if you want and to the shopping complex. They shopping there is called ""Crystals"" and it is only high end, Prada, Gucci, etc. The rooms were a reasonable rate and the casino was hopping ALL the time. Fun! A few things that were cons... they do not give you enough or the proper linens. Not enough towels, not a mat for the floor outside the shower.. I thought that was odd. They do not replace the toilet paper, you have to ask for that, or at least we did. They do not have a tea or coffee service in the room so that you can make yourself a cup of tea before you leave the room or while you are getting ready. The room is small, not a lot of room to walk around or even have friends up to the room if you wanted. Because we are used to staying at the other end of the strip that is quieter, I found this hotel to be really noisy both inside and out. BUT all in all, we had a goof time. We will be staying here again for sure. Now go have fun!! Next time we will def. upgrade to a suite. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I ate in here on Friday night at about 9pm when I'd been sipping in wine since 4:30. My point is, my review might be sliiiiiiiiightly skewed by my starvation and intoxication, but not much. When I walked in I noticed how clean, friendly, and well decorated this place is. I know that's not exactly a must in a chippy, but a nice addition anyway. My man wanted pizza while I was jonesing for a fish supper. I was sent next door to get the pizza and the sweet wee woman behind the counter didn't want any of the food to go cold so she advised me to order my supper after the pizza was ready because it might take a while. I was too hungry and just ordered and ate my supper right there, as my man waited for his pizza. Cruel, I know. It was divine. I can't normally finish a fish supper because it eventually gets a bit soggy and a bit gross. Not this one. I took it DOWN (not at all alcohol related...). The batter was wonderfully crispy (I'll admit I actually resorted to munching on plain batter), and the fish was perfectly moist. I asked for extra salt and vinegar and it was doused to my heart's content. I'll admit, I don't really recall much about the chips, because I was so busy devouring the fish, but I'm sure they must have been quite nice! To be honest, though, the reason why this place really stands out for me is that they've joined the ""Fish Fight"" - you know, where all of those celebrity chefs are trying to get people, chippies, fishmongers and supermarkets to start branching out and trying different types of fish, and reduce the strain on overfished breeds like Haddock? So, they have the choice of mackerel here as well. They advertise it in a bap, but I'm assuming you can go for it as your supper if you so please. My man and I decided that we would go mackerel next time, when we're a wee bit more with it. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We eat here every few weeks and would normally give it five stars for good food and good service. I especially like that they have a photo of steaks in varying degrees of doneness. That is a big help, the steaks are cooked well and the salad bar is well-stocked, but this evening Husband and I went in with plans to order lobster for him and steak for me. We were accosted at the door by a pushy loudmouth who started out by asking if it was our first time there and did we know the menu. We said yes and thought he would back off and let us read it. He kept on pushing, so I said I just wanted a steak. The menu is in English, which I read fairly fluently, but Loudmouth insisted on reading it to me, pointing out several features he suspected I might have overlooked and was frenetically trying to upsell me on the 2-for-one steaks without even knowing which one I might have chosen or investigating the fact that Husband didn't want steak at all. He wanted lobster. We gave up on getting him off our backs and walked out without ordering. We will go back eventually, hopefully after Loudmouth is gone. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The Root is a great, reasonably priced hair salon in Phoenix. The stylists are extremely well trained and very knowledgeable as to their products and trade. The owner is Lauren Hart and I have been going to her for about 12 years now. Every time I leave her salon my hair looks amazing. She has been doing hair for more than 20 years and you can tell. Lauren and her staff continuously go to classes and hair shows to stay up to date on the latest trends and technologies in hair. Everyone that works there does an amazing job and they are all so friendly and upbeat. The decor is very minimal and everything is extremely clean. There is really cool artwork everywhere that is all for sale and changes periodically. The salon is really a place you can go relax and enjoy yourself. I recommend this salon to everyone I know because the staff is very professional, knowledgeable and friendly. I know how hard it is to find someone to do a great job on my hair and I have been fortunate to find this salon. If you are new to the area or just need a new stylist, The Root has what you are looking for. They specialize in color correction and they really do have the client's best interest in mind. They also offer some waxing services, deep conditioning, and they carry a wide variety of products. One tip, call ahead. Because they are so good at what they do, you need to book your appointment in advance, especially if you want to get in with Lauren. Also, they are closed on Sundays. ",0,0,0,0,1

He was about to make my cali roll when his wife i think started yelling in a non-english language. I asked to maybe get something real easy and she kept yelling at him. finally I gave up and let them know that i intended to not ever come back and not refer a single person to their establishment due to the unacceptable customer service, the man said ""go, get out to here"", sheer rudeness like i have never encountered.

 Best advice is to avoid Italian (fake) places in Vegas. We ordered marsala, baked ziti, linguine bolognese, bruschetta pizza.... and it all tasted like food you might barf up after a drunk night on the strip... Well, that is, after you washed it off in the sink. I'm serious. It tastes like you washed it with water. And in the $20 price range.. where you could make this all at home with no experience for $1-2, they are sheistering you big time. We were a group of four, and our server was hesitant to give us seconds on the bread rolls... which by the way I recognized as frozen Pillsbury dough boy dinner rolls covered in butter and garlic powder salt (not even real butter).. it tasted chemical-ly. Another in our group recognized some of the flavors as Stouffer's frozen food. This review is written by native Los Angelinos New Yorkers and Europeans... maybe our expectations are too high. You'd have better luck eating next door at Grand Luxe Cafe. I guarantee your food will be better there, even though that's a chain. After all, this is a fake boutique Italian restaurant in an indoor shopping mall. ",0,1,0,0,0

 BOTTOM LINE: Three floors of cocktail lounge serving high priced libations that clock in between $12 and $18 all under the umbrella, literally, of a beaded curtain to resemble a giant crystal chandelier. This is Las Vegas, after all. Our first reaction of ""isn't this cool"" when we first saw the Chandelier Bar changed to ""we won't come back here"" as a result of experince with poor cocktail quality and service on the second floor. We're glad we went to check out The Chandelier Bar since it had so much buzz. It was worth a single visit. But overall, for a very good cocktail at The Cosmo with good service and a choose your own table seating format, we'd recommend the Vesper Bar in the lobby. For a great cocktail with stellar service and views, although at a bit higher prices, we think you'd be much better off walking over to the Mandarin Oriental and the cocktail lounge there. Different strokes for different folks. Fortunately Las Vegas has a plethora of good cocktail bar options. The Chandelier isn't one of them. ""ISN'T THIS COOL"" elements: 1 ENGINEERING INTEREST: . The top two floors of Chandelier bar are enclosed in drapes of literally a couple of million crystal beads. (See close up photo.) Even for those who are of the age to have seen many, many crystal beaded curtains when they were the thing during our college years, this tops them all. What most amazed me as design and engineering is that one of the friendly security staff said he was working the week this was erected and they came in and placed each segment perfectly, not needing to take down and redo even one. 2, EACH FLOOR UNIQUE: You may want to browse all three levels of the Chandelier before you settle in and order something. Whether you use the interior glass surrounded staircase to navigate between levels or the glass enclosed elevator that is just outside the bar. Each floor has its' own specialty cocktail menu and its' own vibe. The first floor, adjacent to the casino gaming area is open, bright if that's what appeals to you. The second floor is more dark with the sense of being enveloped by the crystal strands. (This eems the ""see and be seen"" spot. ) The third floor seems more intimate for folks having, ummm, conversations. 3. MIX OF PEOPLE: Maybe it's because we were at Chandelier bar at mid week or because it was an earlier hour of about 8 pm, but neither the second nor third floor bars had many people in them. And if f you're intimidated about trying these locations due to the buzz about The Cosmopolitan in general and in particular this bar being the gathering place for only young, beautiful hard body types, don't be. Speaking from our experience throughout the Cosmo and at this bar too, there was mix of folks of all ages and styles. ""WE WON'T COME BACK HERE"" elements. 1. POOR QUALITY PRICEY COCKTAILS: the ones we ordered at the second floor bar were expensive (about $14 for a Manhattan as example) and not very good. Hubby dubbed his Manhattan one of the worst ever in thirty years of enjoying the same. Served too warm and too much vermouth. 2. POOR SERVICE: I wanted an Irish Coffee but was told there was no coffee ""at this level"" and the option suggested to me was Bailey's Irish Creme served up as it was ""basically the same"" said the waitress. That's not even close was my reply. Well, she said, we could send a runner to another floor for coffee ""...if you insist but it will be cold when it gets here."" As a result, , I ordered a second floor specialty drink, a ""Campfire"" that was served with three charred marshmallows across the top. My bad. So was the drink. We didn't finish either cocktail. They were simply huge, alcohol bombs. From our perspective, a good cocktail is about finesse. Not here. As aside,I'll say the poor service here stood out as sub par because our experience over a couple of days at The Cosmo's other facilities was that staff was uber friendly staff and helpful.. 3. SNOOTY SEATING: Another tun off for us about the Chandelier's second floor was the seating hostess set up as you entered to guide you to a table. In our case, although the place was nearly empty, we were walked to a bad table in a dark corner. When we said we'd prefer to sit in the middle of the little occupied room, we were escorted there. We were nicely dressed, but still perhaps not the age demographic the Chandelier Bar is trying to encourage? Regardless, being offered one of the worst tables in the nearly empty place didn't start us out feeling good about the experience. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Going on six years with this place (I would go to them when they were on sahara and decatur).Currently located on Tivoli Village (i do believe they are moving locations, however i'm not sure where at this moment) Bree (who has waxed me and am proud to disclose that lol) has created a harmonious and relaxing atmosphere. There are not enough descriptive words to explain how great everyone is. Ive been waxed by all their staff and each single individual deserves recognition honestly! Ive gotten the full brazilian, my legs, my eyebrows, underarms waxed here. (All at once and separately at times) Everyones skin is different so everyone will react differently. With that said, I have minimal swelling but goes away by the time i get home. Waxing is waxing and with the course of time as your hair gets thinner, it just hurts less until one day you end up like me with little to no pain. It is by appointment only, which is great because they WILL use that time to focus on you and only you! You can read as much as possible but there is no better action than booking your appointment and feeling the experience and meeting everyone for yourself. Afterwards, drink some of the tea they have and sit back and enjoy the new you that has surfaced!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Anyone from Chicago has to go! its just like one of the little hole in the wall type places in Chicago that has all the classic food with a new flavor and taste. Their Beefs are AMAZING!! The service was Amazing. Billie was the nice lady working and she is a gem! So nice and caring and very concerned about the appearance and performance of their restaurant. I have been back 4 times since and the food seems to get better. It is a little pricey, but worth it!! You are supporting a real small business that deserves your patronage! You must try a Beef from there. It is a different sandwich than Al's, so it is tough to compare, but if you love classic Chicago Beef this is the place for you! if you have never been to Chicago this is a true taste of it!

 We stayed at the Hard Rock and this restaurant was unfortunately the most approachable and convenient. The first day I had the 'Rehab' breakfast, with a spinach & mushroom omelette and fresh squeezed OJ. The omelette was barely edible, with the thick overcooked eggs (I sub'd real eggs for egg whites), and nasty unsalted spinach. The fresh squeezed OJ was excellent though. 2nd day I had the eggs over easy with hash browns and grilled ham. The eggs were decent, but the hash browns had way too much butter (or margarine?), and the ham was well, ham, with grills marks to boot. 3rd day I had the chicken noodle soup, opting to avoid any more wasted calories at this joint. The puny bowl came with an overly generous serving of celery, onion, and carrots, with few chicken and even fewer noodles, maybe 3 noodles total. Do not eat here, even if you're drunk. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I have eaten at all of the Sushi Sambas now. Vegas is not the best one, unfortunately. It's a cool space. Very modern and cool looking. Loved the open kitchen and the robata menu items which weren't available at other locations. However. The service sucked big old donkey balls. Our waitress was SO rude, short and annoying. She was mad because we wanted to order off the menu instead of having *her* pick our food and bring it out family style. Why would we want her to pick our food? I get the whole family style and how it makes it easier with larger parties, but at least tell a sister that when she makes a reservation instead of springing it on her when she sits down. Then don't refuse to bring menus, get pissed when we ask for them, or be brusque and rude when taking orders or bringing food. You better believe I talked to the management and gave them a (nice) earful. But the food was good...as it is at all Sushi Sambas. Especially the sea bass, the sushi, and the chicken robata.

 Since its been featured on tv soo many times as one of the best buffets, i had to try it out. Came here for Brunch on a Sunday morning, (the later you get here the longer you wait) we got champagne with our meal so it was $30 per person but we got endless mimosas! MMm MM!M!! to tel you the truth i was disappointed, i was expecting a lot more since there was a lot of hype about it. Theres a lot of selection of food which i like, the bacon was delicious, and they had pesto mashed potatoes which i loved!! Chinese food, breakfast, sushi, pastas..etc etc!!..... ...but no hashbrowns!!?! no corn hash?!?!...and the dessert really disappointed me, a lot of seltion but it wasnt really that good.

 This place is cool. It has a lot to offer compared to just a regular restaurant. It's an old western little town with a dirt road, shoppes, and a steakhouse which has live country music. There is also a straight up saloon that makes even the biggest city slicker feel like Clint Eastwood. But wait, there's more! Cowboy sunset cookouts, gunfighter shows and Bull riding! Thats my kind of fun, and still very family friendly. 1 downside- the rocky dirt parking lot. No heels or flip flops- way too much dirt so pull out those Cowboy boots & have fun. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Oh how I miss Courier Cafe. Every single time I come back to C/U for something I try and grab lunch here. I've never had a bad meal here. The Banker's Burger is fantastic, the Monkey Stuff sandwich sounds weird, but is amazing. Some of the sandwiches are obscene in their size. Asking for a side of mayo is a mistake as they will bring you a 1/4 of mayo. The sweet potato chips are delicious. They also have a salad bar that has a decent selection. But ignore all of what I said above because none of it matters. Even if Courier had the worst lunch and breakfast food on earth, I'd still go for the shakes. Oh my god the shakes. I get the shakes thinking about their shakes. Feeling like a high roller? Order the apple pie shake. Some of the waitresses will not know what you are talking about, but once you explain it to them, they will make it. Piece of apple pie + ice cream + blender = apple pie shake. They will charge you for both a slice of pie and a shake, and it is worth every penny. Great to take your date who isn't watching her figure (or is way too damn skinny and needs to bulk up a bit). Seriously, stop reading and go get an apple pie shake! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I'm on the constant hunt for good Chinese food in Phoenix. After many disappointing meals, I found Desert Jade and haven't looked back. The restaurant is super clean and quaint inside (even a big fireplace) and the service is great. Each of our servers have been super friendly and attentive. The food is really good. It's not going to blow you away, but it's fresh, portions are just right and I've never left unsatisfied. I really like the Kung Pao Chicken, the Mu Shu Pork, Spicy Chicken with Vegetables (lots of them), and my husband loooves the glazed walnut shrimp. If you're looking for an easy, casual Chinese meal in Phoenix - I promise you this is one of your best bets. ",0,0,0,1,0

 one of the most amazing meals i have ever enjoyed. i took my boyfriend to vegas for his birthday and set up L'Atelier as his birthday dinner. From start to finish, the service and all our dishes were absolutely amazing. We started our meal with the baby kushi oysters poached in french butter and the lobster gelee in a cream leak soup, which both were amazing. order the big eye tuna in tomato infused olive oil. it is a really wonderful dish. then we had the roasted rack of lamb which was so tender and juicy and we also ordered the gnocchi which were so tender and well prepared. also the braised pork belly-- wow. that has to be one of the best dishes I have ever tasted in my entire life. order it and you will not be sorry. the sweetbreads, which i stayed away from because i just cant do it... but my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed them and he said the dish was amazing. please do yourself a favor and order the green chartreuse souffle with pistachio ice cream for dessert. It is to die for. I think if a restaurant can pull of a great souffle... they know what they're doing. and no doubt, the chefs on the line here at L'Atelier, know exactly what they're doing. Also as a treat, they surpised the birthday boy with a tray of 6 different tarts that were all absolutely delicious. At L'Atelier, you will have a great experience and you will be thinking about the dishes you had here for weeks even months to come. I ate there in March and I still think about the dishes I enjoyed there. The tab came out to be around $500 for all the dishes and mind you, lots of wine. Yes, a bit steep. But for a great memorable meal, I dont mind dropping the cash for. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Comme le nom l'indique, ceci est un restaurant ou l'on mange dans le noir complet. C'est intrigant et plut \ u00f4t amusant (on a bien rit tout le long du repas) mais pas quelque chose que je ferais r \ u00e9guli \ u00e8rement. Le concept n'est pas nouveau \ u00e0 Montr \ u00e9al mais ce restaurant est ouvert depuis a peu pr \ u00e8s 1 ans (qu'on m'a dit). Tout commence dans le lobby o \ u00f9 l'on nous invite \ u00e0 faire un choix d'entr \ u00e9e, de plat principal et de dessert (dans le cas d'un repas a trois services). Pour chaque service, on a l'option de choisir le plat surprise (choix du chef) - on doit donc deviner dans le noir ce que l'on mange. C'est ce que j'ai fait! On choisit aussi les breuvages, bi \ u00e8re, vin, etc. La carte des vins est simple et limit \ u00e9e mais il y a quelques vins qui sont corrects, \ u00e0 mon avis. Les serveurs, qui sont partiellement ou compl \ u00e8tement aveugles, nous am \ u00e8ne a notre table dans le noir et l'exp \ u00e9rience commence. En tout et partout, nous nous sommes bien amus \ u00e9s. Il y a beaucoup de bruit (60 personnes peuvent \ u00eatre assises par service). Il semble que dans le noir les gens compensent en parlant plus fort. Le service fut correcte, notre serveur et copropri \ u00e9taire \ u00e9tait tr \ u00e8s plaisant. La bouffe par contre \ u00e9tait moyenne. Rien de mauvais mais rien de sophistiqu \ u00e9. J'ai bien aim \ u00e9 deviner ce que je mangeais. On nous a aussi offert un digestif \ u00e0 prix r \ u00e9duit, ce qui n'est jamais m \ u00e9chant. Les clients autour de nous, c'est autres choses.

 Came here on a Saturday afternoon and I was pleasantly surprised by Liquid. Walking in I was a tad afraid I was going to walk into something you see at TAO beach. Thank God it was nothing of the sort. They never over packed the place so there was always room to walk around and have your own space. It felt somewhat like a relaxed day at a really nice pool, alas there were still a few crazy people who are doing all the wrong things in a very public place. Seriously, do they know we're staring at them not bc they're hot but instead a hot mess? Children, we are in Vegas that doesn't mean you still don't have a last name that your mom/dad would very much appreciate you not putting to shame. Grandma set aside, Liquid is a place you go for some good music (a DJ spins) and good food!! I'm not lying when I say their mahi mahi tacos were one of tastiest I've had. I promise if you try them they won't disappoint. Only issue is that they make you eat it at the bar, I'd rather eat it where I'm sitting so I can take my time. I had to throw out one of the taco's bc I didn't have space in my tum. All in all the decor is pretty and the place is new and fresh so if you're feeling in the mood for drinks and music by the pool I'd recommend it. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The physical establishment is clean, comfortable in temperature and presentable in appearance. Access is simple enough. Then there's the staff. When I rented the unit (June 2012) I had a great experience with the young man who showed me around and filled out my contract with me. The kid gave great ""face"", as it were. And then. In the initial work-up, I made it Very Effing Clear that email was my preferred contact method because I do not answer calls from numbers I do not recognize, The End. Kiddo says ""hey, no problem, we'll totally email you if we need to get hold of you for anything."" Fast foward several months to the rate change I wasn't made aware of. Then fast forward a couple more months to the NastyGram I got in via regular mail saying ""We're gonna auction off all your shit if you don't pay us""... except the money was no longer in my account as it had been sent to them via automated bill-pay. So I call them and attempted to address the issue. Hahaha. The person on the phone (Terry, female) seemed to have difficulty comprehending my words - I explained the situation from my POV and she not only disregarded what I said but interrupted me several times in order to do it. I freely admit I lost my patience (and nearly my temper) with her. The situation is mostly resolved now, but I promise I am moving out of there next month because you will get a lot of lip service but not a lot of follow-through from this organization... and the new place less than a mile from my house is $50 a month cheaper for more space and a U-haul to move it all with. :) ",0,1,0,0,0

 Okay I want to like this place and only giving two stars is really hard! The sushi was fresh and nice portions and the wildfire and sweet tomato are my new fave rolls.... But.... The service was below average. Felt uncomfortable there. And it didn't help that the guy, who based on other yelpers picks might be the owner was rude! I ordered a Snow White to him, he took my order then walked away. 10 min later I realized he wasn't coming back and didn't tell other chef about my order so I had to order it again. Our rolls were good but based on other yelpers picks who know him, we got short sticked on our presentation... I like the radish noodles with my sushi! Then they don't do half rolls and with all you can eat there are so many limitations. I agree with other yelpers that with all those limitations I can go somewhere else! Only certain appetizers are included in all you can eat, you can only do one each of the rolls with no rice, and because of those rolls I had to pay dinner price at lunch time. I really want to like this place as they had good selection and all. But I didn't feel comfy... When chef gave me attitude when I said most places have a tiger roll and it's good I was like what??? And they weren't very nice to my kid who loves sushi and loves sitting at the bar cause most places make it fun for her! So due to all that I gave two for quality of fish and selection but when I go out I want to enjoy myself! ",0,1,0,0,0

 How hard could it be to get some service around here? When we first arrived, the previous patrons were arguing with the waitress because they refused to show proper I.D. Luckily, they stormed off and left us with an open table. Unfortunately for us, however, the waitress never came back. We ended up getting cigars at the bar, which turned out to be a waste of money. It was probably our dumb luck that we picked the worst cigars from the menu selection of 4 but since there's a Davidoff cigar shop right around the corner, why bother? At the cigar shop, you'll get a better selection, better quality, and lower price. The only thing memorable about Zuri is the look of the bartender when I attempted to order its hangover cure. I tried ordering at 5:45pm (because it was the only ""manly drink"") and he told me ""you don't want that."" It wasn't even a suggestion as it was a mandate. He probably knows best.

 My husband scheduled us an appointment at this office for two reasons: It was only a mile and a half from our house, and the contracted rate for the dentist's services was the most reasonable in the area. (We both work with a health insurance company, so we're knowledgeable about how providers are billed.) Upon arriving, we were both very impressed with the office design. The whole design was based off a train station, or rather, a toy train station. There's a rail near the ceiling that runs throughout the office. Everything upfront is wooden and has an antiquated feel. It really is sight to behold. Even if you don't ever get services rendered, I would suggest anyone to marvel the imagination that went into this office. The front-office staff was definitely less than stellar. To be specific, the young, blond woman upfront was very welcoming and professional. Even when she handed me what I'm sure she realized was an embarrassing amount of paperwork to complete, she did so with a smile. I enjoyed her. Her colleague struck me as unfriendly and irritated by slow patient check-ins or unsuccessful insurance verifications. I didn't have direct interactions with her; this was only my observation. I do want to state that, although I didn't see him, I heard the dentist talking with a walk-in patient who had some questions. From a customer-service stance, the man was very good at using well-positioned statements, using empathetic language, and providing options. I was VERY impressed with him even though I never even saw his face (because I was filling out paperwork). The patient rooms are also nice and modern, with flat-screen monitors, well-kept and clean instruments, and open environments. Some offices give the impression of cramming in as many patients as possible, as if we're Chicken McNuggets. Not the case with this one. The salesperson approach was apparent the moment I went to the examination room. The hygienist, while nice and professional, talked about issues she noted with my teeth while positioning them with services that I knew my insurance wouldn't cover and would, resultantly, allow for balance-billing. I also discussed the need for me to resume my orthodontic treatment, since I pulled my braces off six months before after I lost my insurance. The salesperson approach kicked into overdrive with the gratuitous praise heaped upon the orthodontist, someone who apparently always uses the ""most cutting-edge"" technology in all of Phoenix. In fact, she mentioned this twice during my visit. The whole discussion was so glib. What irritated me most was that I was originally scheduled for a standard cleaning. They never got around to that. They discussed with me the need for a deep-scale, which I knew I needed, but I also knew that I had to schedule that after my standard cleaning. Instead, when I asked about whether I could get any treatment while I was there--at the least, a cleaning--the hygienist stated that they had a 3 p.m. appointment that they had to tend to, so they wouldn't be able to get to me that day. In essence, I never got what I came for. Yeah, not the professional response I expected. (On a separate note, my husband was scheduled at the same time. They were successful in getting his cleaning done and, according to him, they never took a salesperson approach with him.) They provided me a treatment plan, with associated costs, which was another irritant. Apparently, their contracted rate was nearly double what the insurance company told me it would be. Although I have a co-insurance, this, nonetheless, increased costs by nearly twofold. I left the office with scheduled appointments for my deep-scale and fillings, but after I got home and thought about the entire experience, I made the decision that I'd seek services elsewhere. If the blond woman and the faceless dentist I heard ran the entire office, I'd happily pay premium dollar for the service. However, the other front-office professional, hygienist, and my dentist assured me that I would never return. My husband raved about the office the entire time home. I hope they both have a long, illustrious relationship together. No thanks for me. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Le village buffet dessert has a 33% acceptable rating per Jon. The creme brulee was at least brulee'd here; however the creme lacked body and flavor. Cheese cake was the usual central kitchen fail. The \ u00e9claire was stale and creme was the same failed concoction in most of their desserts. The only acceptable dishes offered was their macaroons and flan. Macaroons were soft and moist with good flavor. Flan had body and was covered in light simple syrupy that doesn't over power the flan.

 My husband and I recently moved to Madison from LA, so I'm trying to understand the total lack of good service in town. This is the first sushi bar I've ever been to (and I have been to MANY), where when seated at the actual bar, I couldn't order directly from the sushi chef. I get the impression from most of the recent reviews that the majority of customers here have never been to real sushi, and didn't think this was an abnormality. We waited a good half hour to get a seat at the sushi bar, but that wasn't a big deal, as we gave the hostess our cell number and went for a walk. When we were called back, she tried to seat us at a table, when there were 5 seats open at the bar. She recovered, and when we finally sat down at the sushi bar and tried to make conversation with the chef/owner and order. He didn't indicate at all that we needed to order from anyone else, but after 10 minutes of awkward chatting/waiting, our waitress came and said that we had to order from her. We had the hostess and our waitress talk up a scallop special and their rolls, so ordered a the scallop (a cold and hot combo), a crunchy tuna roll and a lolipop roll (both recommended). The scallop sashimi was good, but the cooked part of the appetizer was greasy and overcooked, and I'm not sure where the actual scallop was. Both of the rolls were visually pretty but very underwhelming. We were given our first order rapid-fire without our sake. After 20 minutes, our waitress came back and asked us if she'd forgotten our sake, and another 10 minutes after we'd refused the sake, she came back and apologized and offered us a small sake on the house (we'd ordered a bottle, not a small). We're pretty picky about our rolls, so we figured we'd just spend the rest of the evening eating nigiri and sashimi. The actual nigiri and sashimi were good here, and as another yelper said, the uni in particular was good. What the owner served us as hamachi however was definitely snapper, and the toro was medium toro at best. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Advocate's Close is a great way to get from Cockburn Street to the Royal Mile as it's a nice little historic close surrounded by wonderful buildings.

 I LOVE coffee and try places all over. I really, really wanted to like this place. The coffee is average. The pastries are average but expensive for what you get (americano is $4, muffin $3). The wi-fi is ok but don't expect to stream music. It often cuts out. The air conditioning is set at a high temp so if you like it cool, this is not the place for you. ",0,1,0,0,0

 The food was very good, a little overpriced. We went for my daughters birthday. I had purchased a groupon. The waiter gave my daughter a complimentary dessert. I thought this was very nice. I felt obligated to purchase another as well... The waiter then told us the dessert was not complimentary - after we ate it - and billed us for it. I thought this was in poor taste to do on my 16 year olds birthday. I will not be going back due to the tacky service. The dessert was $10, the experience left a bad taste. ",0,1,0,0,0

 So yes, right after my visit to 168 market, I had to come to SF to complete my grocery shopping. The crab is still cheaper here than anywhere else. This Asian supermarket is awesome because it is big, have tons of produce, fish, meat, snacks, and so much more. And the best part of all, the prices of these items will not dent your bank (unlike the hit I get from buying items from Albertsons). I love coming here for fruits and veggies. For example, Fuji apples - $.69/lb, California navel Oranges -4lb for $.99, bunch of spinach - $.89...how cheap and healthy is that! They have a deli area that sells Vietnamese sandwiches, and many other Vietnamese snacks/goodies. I am not a fan of the sandwiches there. It's kinda bland. Anyways, I feel good walking out of the store w/my bags of grocery, knowing that I didn't overpay on them (compared to American Supermarkets). ",0,0,0,1,0

 Paris hotel was so so. Room was average decor but appeared run down and dated. Stain on ottoman, missing knob from entertainment center, scratched up baseboards, and door to room was all scuffed making it appear dirty. However room size was larger than normal and the bathroom was nice with a walk in shower. Previous reviews indicated rude staff. Those reviews were right on. Check in started nice however when I asked to upgrade to a Petite Suite with view she rudely said nobody gets a petite suite with a view over a weekend. She made me feel embarrassed for asking. Day of leave we went to have our bags stored. Bell hop was dealing with a customer before us. His demeanor with those customer was rude. They were looking for their bags and needless to say he told them to go back to their rooms to find them. They had a hard time with English and he wasn't about to slow down and try to help explain things. When it was our turn he wanted to know why we were storing them and then went into interrogation mode wanting to know rudely what we were going to do while our bags where there. His way of asking really put us on the defensive. We seemed to be an inconvenience for him and he didn't attempt to hide it. Overall disappointing experience for a hotel that appears so nice on the outside. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I feel like Twitter is pretty useless so far; I have an ok amount of followers I guess, but I feel like they're all following so many people that anything I say gets lost in the mess of their feed. I could tweet all day and get very little response to anything aside from a couple loyal folks on there. And it was one such reader that led me to Delmonico recently for what he claimed to be an excellent burger. He's a food writer in town so he should know what he's talking about, right? Delmonico is located in the small restaurant row of the Venetian right by another great burger spot, although most people would not come here for their burger. The interior is nothing too fancy in either the bar area or more traditional area in the back. I did notice while sitting at the bar that they have an amazing bourbon selection, but since I was there during a lunch break I'll have to go back some time when I'm not on the clock. The lunch and dinner menus are a bit different, with the lunch menu featuring more sandwiches and things, so maybe the comment I just made about people not coming for a burger is wrong. Either way, this restaurant is pretty fancy and features quite a number of great sounding items aside from what I came there for. The Delmonico Prime Hamburger comes on a toasted brioche roll with fries, cheddar cheese and bacon. The meat had excellent flavor from the first bite, but I noticed right away that it was way overcooked and dry. It started off extremely juicy but that faded way too fast and by the end it was very dry. The cheese was melted and had great flavor, but the bun was a tiny bit dry as well and a little too thick. The heirloom tomatoes were fantastic, but maybe a bit off-putting at first due to their green color. The bacon also had good flavor, but was a tiny bit undercooked and soggy in parts. Overall it was still decent, but could have been well beyond that if the meat had been cooked properly. Luckily the fries were great. Some of them were almost a bit too hard and crunchy, but they were very tasty and a welcome change to the 'typical' fries I often get around town. Something I found to be quite funny was when I asked for ketchup I was brought an insanely large bowl of it, more than probably a table full of people could have used. The online menu lists the burger at $15, so I was a little surprised to see the $18 listed on the menu when I made my order. I think if it was cooked properly I would still be ok with this price given the chef, the location, etc, but because of this price I seriously frown on the fact that they couldn't cook my burger properly. If you're willing to risk this inconsistency and are ok with the cost, I think it's a good burger to check out, and has the potential to be really great, but if you're at the Venetian and are craving a guaranteed good burger for a similar cost I suggest you go next door.

 I did some research, saw great reviews for this place and decided to try while on a trip. I love fried chicken, biscuts and potatoes so thought this was right up my alley. I went for breakfast. The service was fast, but bottom line I wasnt impressed with the food. I got the fried chicken biscut with potatoes. The fried chicken really didnt have any great flavor or juiciness to it. Yes the biscuts were good. The potatoes were like tater tots. Not what I expected for breakfast and nothing better than the average tater tot. No ketchup? I went back and asked for hot sauce which made it all tollerable. It wasnt horrible, it just wasnt great. If you're looking for great fried chicken I wouldn't say this is the place. ",0,1,0,0,0

 While it's starting to look a little dated, it's still a great place. The rooms are huge, with floor to ceiling windows, and a fridge you can actually use. The buffet is still one of my favorites for a champagne brunch (I love the Mongolian station). Good pool(s). The wine cellar is awesome. Voodoo Lounge still has amazing views. Shuttle service to the strip. Great venue to hold the WSOP. They probably should start pouring some money into sprucing up the place, because it's kinda at the turning point. If they let it go, it will look like hell in a few more years, but it's at the point where it can still be saved. I hope they get on it, because I really like the place. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I am by far the biggest fan of Hickory Tavern's build your own salad. I literally could eat it every day. At this location, however, simple instruction and ability to listen seem to be their biggest hurdle. I've called in to go orders, on multiple occasions, and they just can't seem to ever get it right. I don't know if it's the ""builder"" or the person taking the order. The continued mistake has prevented me from calling these guys for the past couple of weeks but tonight I really wanted one of those salads and decided to give it a shot. Friday night, super busy inside, go in, food is ready, get home, and BAM... It's wrong again. The roller coaster of emotion from excitement to disappointment to anger is the reason I'm writing today. $12.95 for a salad (with protein), when built by the customer, should be done correctly 100% of the time!

 Comfortable bed is the only good thing I can say. They said the rooms were recently renovated but they need to call the show catch a contractor because they didn't finish the job. 2 elevators were out so I could have either walked 4 flights up and down the stairs or wait 10 minutes for the elevator. Cold showers. Water is too hot then too cold. Something was wrong with my heating unit. Every 10 minutes it would start up and make an annoying loud sound for about 15 seconds. I refused to have my room cleaned because I felt the floor maids were unprofessional. As I was waiting for the elevator about 3 of them were cleaning rooms and talking loud about the guest who recently stayed in the room using vulgar language and so on. Coming in from a night at the bar you are hungry. They have no small store or anything to grab a quick snack and the 24hr room service is just sandwiches. The people st the font desk were hit or miss. Some people were friendly and helpful others acted as if you were bothering them. It was about 1 AM and a group of front desk people were standing around and I asked them about room service and they looked at me like I said something crazy. And didn't ask if I needed a menu for anything else or my options in the area. At the end of the day. I would NEVER stay here again.. I would rather stay in a Red Roof inn to be honest with you.

 I am always in search of a great sushi place with fresh fish and decent prices and I was really hoping NZ Cafe would fit the bill. We walked in and the place was absolutely slammed for a Monday, so that was a great sign. The seating is a bit too close for comfort in my opinion- conversations next to us were distracting as I am sure we were to others as well. Service was poor and slow . We had two servers (I think?), my point is that I really had no idea who our actual server was. we ordered four rolls: christmas, sweet dragon, crazy, and discovery We only really cared for two out of four (s.d and christmas) - disovery was one of the worst rolls I have ever had - very fishy tasting and honestly sloppy.I had an issue with the overall temperature of all the rolls - very warm and the avocado on the rolls was a mushy mess. We must have read the menu wrong because we thought we were getting three unfried rolls and one fried but two ended up being over-fried almost to the point where they lost any of the delicateness of sushi. Lastly I am a big fan of wasabi and tend to add quite a bit to my low sodium soy, but they must have super-salty wasabi paste because it was almost inedible....and not spicy enough. On a positive note the wooden boat displays were a really cool idea and certainly warranted us taking a few photos. Overall though, the distance and quality make this a no-go for me ... ",0,1,0,0,0

 VERY on the fence with this store now. Bought my first house 6 months ago (huge project house) the first 30days we replaced literally everything from floors and doors to sinks. Spends thousands apon thousands of dollars at this store. Im seriously in this store at least every week with a new project. But now with 3 bad experiences in a row, I am unsure about going back soon. My best experience was always at the paint counter, the guys there were always friendly and saw me daily for over a week. Everywhere else in the store is hit or miss on customer service. 2 or 3 weeks ago I was inquring on wall units, a nice gentleman informed me they did not carry the specific style I wanted, I could special order and it would be there in 4 weeks, or I could go down to the south power store and get them there because they have them in stock there. . . Yeah they didn't have them instock either, they are special order there also. So i waisted alot of time looking for something I wasnt going to find. Last week I went in with a new yard project. I asked for help very specifically on PET friendly products, a associate said 'i think they all are'. I was pretty much in shock, most weed killers are dangerous to dogs/cats. I told her it was very imprtant to me so i needed to be sure. She showed me a product she was ""100% positive"" was safe after 5 minutes. After she walked away I was about to grab it off the shelf but my husband looked up the product on his phone first. He went to the actual products website and read the long page of warnings. In big and bold it said Do NOT let children or animals outside for 24 hours after using product on yard! I was PISSED! My dogs could have ended up poisoned because of this associate talking about something she did not know. I would rather someone be honest and say they didnt know than just give me an answer i wanted. And then today, I decided I want to re-do my laundry room. I saw a sale on wall cabinets and called to inquire. Went through the automatted system, pressed for 'kitchen cabinets' and it rang and rang. Customer service finally answered, they directed me again, and it rang and rang again. Customer Service picked up again and VERY RUDELY informed me there was nobody to take my call, she would take my name and number and have someone call me back. ----Exuse me? there is nobody to take my call? I was shocked.---- I asked 'dont you guys always have a lot of staff on hand?' she (still rudely) said 'yes but she is on lunch' I said 'I just have a question about cabinets' she again stated 'BUT THE PERSON IS ON LUNCH, I can get your number and have someone call you back!' I asked if there was anybody else I could possibly ask a question to. She said ""YES, AND SHES OUT ON A FAMILY EMERGENY,"" I said ""okay then I guess I wont be shopping with you"" she asked (STILL rude) ""are you going to leave me your name and number?"" .... I hung up... Sorry (VERY long story short) You never know what you are going to get with this store, its like some associates are nice and helpful and then others could care less... Today (since i obviously wasnt going to this store after being treated so rudely on the phone) I went to the MESA RIVERVIEW STORE for my cabinets, ceiling fan, and all my other laundry room makeover needs and they were very nice and helpful.

 Food, friends, and good vibes is what you can expect from FTF. There are some amazing trucks here and having The Common Market nearby for a quick beer stop is always a plus. I've never had a bad experience and it actually makes me wish there were two Fridays in the week. Why not, right? As far as seating goes benches are provided but they become occupied quickly so I would recommend bringing some lawn chairs or a blanket unless you prefer to stand and eat. If you're new to FTF I suggest following the crowd. Certain trucks have longer lines than others and for good reason. All the trucks make great food but some are just better than others.

 On a business trip in WI and wanted to try something different for supper. I definitely found a great type of food that I have managed to miss until now. Korean food may replace Thai as my favorite Asian food. I had the kimchi jjigae which is a kind of cabbage stew with onions and lots of other wonderful veggies. I had the tuna but could have chosen pork. The tuna was wonderful and the soup brought together so many wonderful tastes and textures that I will definitely be searching for Korean food when I get back home! I began the meal with an order of spring rolls which were crispy as few restaurants can accomplish. Service could not have been better. If you are in Middleton, Wi and looking for some awesome combinations of subtle spices, warm and friendly service and an enjoyable evening, you should definitely try this place! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Huge fan of Park n Go. CLT Airport is a mess with all the construction. The standard airport lots are a pain in the butt and if you don't mark down exactly where you parked, you could be searching for hours for your car. PNG takes some of the pain out of the process. For less than five bucks a day, they keep your car 5 mins from CLT departures and arrivals. But the real value comes from the service. They run shuttles constantly - I've never waited more than 5 mins after arrivals, and the bus helps load you FROM your car for departures. They also ""remember"" where your car is parked for you. Last couple times I used them, they gave me bottle of water on the way out. Love these guys. 5 stars. ",0,0,0,0,1

 A little over a year ago I watched the Top Chef Masters dine at Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas and ever since then this hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant has been on my Yelp bookmark list, just waiting for my next trip to Vegas. Lucky me that trip came this year and I knew that Lotus of Siam was the ONE place that was a must-do for me. Located in a nondescript strip mall about a $15-$20 cab drive away from the main strip, Lotus of Siam is unassuming from the outside but has been praised as one of the best Thai restaurants in America. We gave the doorman at the hotel the address and as the cab pulled up all he said was ""Lotus of Siam""...no address needed. When you pull up you might be questionable but trust me, looks are deceiving! Lotus of Siam is open for lunch and dinner and while we had initially planned a lunch visit, we got distracted and pushed it back to dinner. We didn't have a reservation and they were booked for the night so we arrived early right before they opened to secure a seat. If you plan in advance I would definitely make a reservation if you want to eat at a more ""peak"" time, but they do have a bar where you can try a glass from their lengthy wine menu while you wait. I had done my fair amount of research ahead of time (because I'm a nerd like that) so I knew exactly what I planned on ordering. Lotus of Siam is a bit unique because they offer quite a few Northern Thai dishes, which you don't see on the menus of most Thai restaurants. Our first dish was the very popular Tom Kah Kai soup. Chicken, coconut milk, mushrooms, lemongrass, and lime...this was quite possibly one of the best soups I've ever eaten. We chose a spice level of medium for all of our dishes and found it to be perfect for our taste-a good amount of heat but nothing that was searing away our taste buds. After the soup came the Garlic Prawns. This is one of their most popular dishes and it's no wonder why...deep fried prawns with shells that crisp up like potato chips, saut \ u00e9ed in a tasty garlic sauce and cooked to perfection. Delicious!! Next up...Braised Short Rib with Panang. The short rib wasn't the best I've ever had but the sauce-a red cream curry with cognac-was fantastic and absolutely made the dish. It definitely took some restraint to stop from licking the bowl! Our last dish before dessert was one of my go-to Thai carry-out choices....good 'ol Pad Thai. But this was no ordinary Pad Thai-this was the best Pad Thai I've ever eaten, and I have eaten A LOT of Pad Thai. The flavors, the spice level, the crispy vegetables, and of course the noodles....I wanted this whole dish to myself! Last but not least was dessert. We were on the brink of stuffed but I couldn't leave without a few sweet bites. This was actually my first time trying sticky rice and I really enjoyed it. The warm rice with the beautiful, fresh, sweet mango was a great combo and add in a cold bite of the coconut ice cream...the perfect ending to a great meal! From start to finish, from wine to dessert and everything in between, Lotus of Siam lived up to all of my expectations and then some. If you're in Vegas I highly recommend venturing off the strip to give Lotus of Siam a try for yourself, I know this has now made it onto my must-do list for all future trips to LV! ",0,0,0,0,1

 We really wanted to love this place! We recently moved to the area and really miss having downtown Gilbert close by. We took the boys after their football game a month ago and were really disappointed. They didn't have any fries at lunch time...which is strange. The place had an overwhelming smell of greasy food. They were frying something! The server was really sweet, and the kids really liked the popcorn machine...but the food is not worth returning... not for awhile! ",0,1,0,0,0

 The food gets three and a half stars. The service on the night we were there gets one star. The environment gets one star. Temperature was about 87 degrees. Ceiling fans rotated, but we could not feel any air where we were sitting near the front window. Salsa gets four stars. Chips get three, maybe four, because they were warm and the waitress kept bringing them as if she knew our food order would be late. About an hour after the boys and I got there, we still didn't have our food. I had to go get my wife, who was working late, so we were up against a deadline. I asked that it be boxed to go. Well, we left, late, sweating, and thoroughly disgusted. But fortunately, when we got home, the food tasted good. I split a poblano chicken enchilada, rice, beans, and vegetables with my wife. It was very tasty. One of my sons had three tacos that he said were a good bit better (and more expensive) than what he was used to at Taco Bell. The other son had a shrimp dish that he ate about half of (portions are large, and he doesn't eat much at one sitting, especially after consuming copious quantities of chips!), so he liked it. He's picky. So, here's my take: They had an ""off"" night for service. But they might be slow as a general rule, too. The place has a very tiny kitchen, a small bar with about 8 - 10 stools, about five or six booths, and about that many tables. I saw two waitresses, who were helping in the kitchen as well. We got there about 6:10, and left about 7:20 with food in hand. When we arrived, it was busy. When we left, it was full. So folks were waiting a long time for their food. The food is authentic, tastes good, and yields authentic gastrointestinal effects, typical of its type. But the wait was unexpected and unwelcome. I may try it again when I have extra time, but time is something I have less and less of these days... UPDATE: The manager read the review you just read, and emailed me that they did, in fact, struggle that night, with new personnel involved. He apologized for the wait, and asked that we consider giving them another try. Kudos to him for being nice and humble. We probably will go back in a few weeks to check it out. ",0,1,0,0,0

 You know the saying if you get good service you tell no one, but if you get bad service you tell 10 people well that's this case here. When this place gets busy good luck if you sit at the bar they look right past you to serve those standing with out a seat. I tried for 20 minutes to get a 2nd beer even raising my empty glass. They took my empty glass never asked if I wanted another and didn't get back to me for another 10 minutes. The guy next to me waited nearly 30 minutes to order food. He sat their with a menu in his face trying to grab the bartender to order. This place has been open for 2 weeks and is right across from Midwestern University. So the newness might or might not wear off and this place might slow down some that they could actually provide some sort of par level service. I went to this place on a Wednesday and a Friday night and only had the happy hour special food items. It was just ok, nothing to brag about. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We started with the rosemary peach lemonade. It's tart and delicious and I definitely recommend it. We had the onion bisque. It was cream based, pretty tasty but needed extra salt. If you go to Tupelo Honey, you've got to try the southern fried chicken BLT. It's perhaps the best chicken sandwich I have ever had. WOW WOW WOW. It's delicious and HUGE. The scald on the chicken is perfect for this sandwich. The chicken is really juicy and delicious, and the rest of the sandwich went very well. I've been to THC numerous times and this is the best thing I've ever had here. Fried okra on the side was only ok, could be dressed up a bit. I usually get the eggs Betty on a biscuit (HOLY MOTHER this is a delicious breakfast, and with two biscuits total, you are happy to carry your food baby home afterwards). We got the veggie melt too. Just ok because there was way too much white sauce, and it just seemed uninspired next to the chicken masterpiece. I've had this one at THC, I have recommended it to vegetarians and heard very positive reviews, and I've enjoyed the veggie melt myself, but much better at the downtown asheville location. Overall though everything was delicious. The biscuit they bring you is great, with the honey and jam. We'll definitely be back! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Love this casino! On the small side compared to the big guys on the strip - but it feels like old Vegas only updated! Love the vibe!!! I stayed in a renovated room - very nice. Will come again. ",0,0,0,0,1

 If your timing is right you can catch a glimpse of these cats while they are out playing or feeding. Otherwise it just looks like a rock formation with a waterfall. My friends and I were eager to see these big cats once more before they leave the habitat. Yes, that is right, the lions will be leaving the MGM. Until then, it is worth a peek. The two young felines are not bashful and with the prompting of some food, by their handlers, they come right up to the glass for photo ops. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Being born and bred from the midwest it was comforting to have a coffee shop like Kady's in our hotel. However since we are from Chicago the absolute mecca of restaurants, Kady's did fall a bit short. Don't get me wrong the food was average, but the service was slow. The breakfast was alot more appealing then lunch. I wouldn't go out of my way but if you are hungry and its late...stop by Kady's. Keep in mind the host tends to disapppear, so you will be standing around until someone notices you. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I was very excited to finally get to Nordstrom Rack since they took out the one that was near my neighborhood. I think of myself as a great digger that looks in between things to find some really great steals, but I felt like I was doing a little too much of that here. So it personally was disappointing for me. Women's clothing selection is HUGE, but so huge it is almost very unorganized. I swear I could never leave this store without bags in my hand.. If you have time to look through I know for sure you will get a great deal on some name brands, but for sure, you will have to be patient! Happy bargain shopping. ",0,0,1,0,0

 2.5 STARS Not impressed! A couple of years ago, a CoWorker boasted about Winchell's. I had been passing this location when I cruise on Tropicana Avenue toward US 95. Today, I decided to try it. After the experience I am left with the impression that this was a fantastic place a couple of years ago or I caught it at the wrong time which was around 10 on a Monday morning. When I walked in I saw the display case of doughnuts. But I didn't see any signs indicating what type of doughnut. I'm thinking, ""is this a jelly filled pineapple donut or strawberry doughnut? "" To add to the confusion one flavor would be in back of another flavor. This was confusing for the woman that worked here. Furthermore, I did not see any interesting doughnuts that Pink Box or even Dunkin Donuts serves . Mediocre service went hand in hand with the presentation. The woman who served me the ""two donut and coffee special"", that came to $3.25 by the way, was far from nasty and short of friendly. The friendliness trailed far behind Pink Box Doughnuts employees. Before I bit into the doughnut, the coffee experience wasn't exactly leaving me with a sweet first impression. This is probably my first Yelp review where I had to walk from the register to a separate counter holding coffee without a lid. Now the separate counter had the coffee lids but they had zero sugar substitutes. There were two baskets holding packets of sugar but no Sweet N Low or Equal. There are people out there that like sugar substitutes in their coffee! By the way the coffee was drinkable but lagging behind Dunkin Donuts. It is difficult to discuss a doughnut when you don't know what the name is because of no signs. The doghnut with the red frosting fell short of my standards: fresh and delicious. This was the donut in the row in front of the other row of doughnuts. Regardless that it wasn't stale, it sure was far short of fresh out of the oven. It tasted more on the lines of a Hostess doughnut than a competitor's. The second doughnut with the strawberry filling was okay. In conclusion, I am unimpressed. Just glad that I finally tried it.

 Interesting to see that the majority of experiences here on Yelp echo my own. We tried this place 3 times and the 3rd time was the last. Our experience with the food was OK, but the service was really pretty ridiculous. The folks who served us and cut the meats kind of gave us the impression that we were creating a nuisance for them just for the simple fact that we were there. I hadn't written a review before because I really wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, but now that I read the other opinions here on Yelp I thought I'd finally add my 2 cents. Save your money and to to Fogo de Chao. Really. You won't be disappointed there. You will be here. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This is a wonderful classic hotel right on Fremont street. We stayed here last year and are coming back again this September. Yes, the fancy resorts on the strip are brand new and gorgeous, but they are also twice as expensive and I really don't want to walk a million miles just to get to the pool. Last year we had a double room in the Carson tower, the oldest building, but also much less expensive as the new Rush Tower. I mean you are in Vegas... WTF are you doing in the hotel room anyway? I just need a clean place to sleep and shower and the rest of the time I will be out. The room was pretty dated with 80's decor (think rust colored flowered drapes) but at least it was clean! Our room had a big square of carpeting cut out of it and replaced with a square of an almost-matching color. Our window looked out onto the roof of the Plaza parking garage. But honestly, who cares... it's a room and it's cheap. The pool is gorgeous and the shark tank is amazing. It's certainly not an Olympic sized swimming pool by any means, but the water slide is super fun and I loved getting a massage from the waterfall coming down on my shoulders and back. The other infinity pool on the 2nd floor was beautiful too. You aren't going to be diving or doing laps in these pools... they are for relaxing and drinking! We are not fancy people and this hotel is more our style. It's big enough to walk around comfortably, reasonably priced, and right in the middle of the Fremont Street Experience. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I'm never really thrilled when someone suggests Maize's...even though it's attached to my building. Not even on burger night when they advertise $5.00 burgers...which, btw, is really a $10 burger because you HAVE to order a drink to get the special. Ok. But $2.50 for iced tea, another $1.00 for cheese, and REALLY, you're going to charge me another $1.00 for a salad INSTEAD of fries?? The burgers just aren't that interesting or flavorful! I'd much rather go down the road on Central to a different burger night special and get something delicious. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Underwhelming. It's not expensive, considering it's at the Palazzo, and there's nice patio seating. However, the food is so-so. I had a vegetarian omelet that was acceptable, but nothing to write home about. Service was pretty sub-par. Took forever to bring menus, refill waters, take orders, etc. It's the kind of place that you go to because it's convenient and not too expensive. Don't expect to be wowed or anything. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Today I received a call from my sister asking me what were my plans for lunch. Honestly I hadn't thought that far yet. So I acknowledge and ask her to call me when she is on her way or at least close by. I figured by the time she arrived I would have a place selected. Naturally I opt for Joe's Farm Grill for two reasons: 1) she said she was buying and 2) for the fact I had never been there. We jumped in her new car and speed off like two kids chasing down the neighborhood ice cream man. As we pulled up we noticed the Joe's Farm Grill sign and what appeared to be a combination of a large vertical bush and very large tree that resembled a hand flipping the bird. Well it looked like that from our angle. From the looks of the place they had plenty of outdoor seating in the front and back of the place. However today being as windy and rainy as it was we parked ourselves inside. Inside at the counter there were three windows and each window had flat-screens nested above it. Not sure what they were for because they all were off, but I suspect during their peak times it may display the menu. I walked up to the first available window which was the only one open at the time. With the kitchen noises in the background it made it a little difficult to hear. That was pretty much our only interaction with the staff aside from the brief interaction at the pick up window. When my sister was handed her cup the teller quickly mentioned that the soda fountain machine was located outside. We both turned and looked at each other and paused for a moment and thought, Outside? We walked towards the seating area and we noticed a door to the outside and just steps passed the doorway reviled the fountain machine and sauce dispensing stations. Groovy. Just slighty beyond that is a unisex bathroom which has dolls in small display cases embedded in the walls. Two by the toilet and one by the sink. Also strategically placed is a flat screen monitor above the urinal (plays movies about dolls from what I saw), which you can also watch while on the commode. The best part was a small sign implying ""Use the lock button for privacy"" for those not used to having locks for the bathroom. I have read about Joe's Farm Grill before and every time I review their menu the Fontina Burger always catches my attention for what ever reason. Perhaps because it comes prepared with roasted red peppers, grilled mushrooms, arugula, pesto and fontina cheese. Joe's Farm Grill is known for their use of locally raised and natural beef which is a major plus. Also they have a nice selection of cheeses: American, Cheddar, Swiss, Fontina and Blue of course. For the health conscientious customer they offer any of their 1/2 lb burgers with multi-grain buns upon request. Last but not least all burgers come with a side of fries which can be substituted for an additional fee, but cooked with trans-fat free oil no less. I decided to follow my instinct and ordered the Fontina Burger, but decided to upgrade my fries to onion rings and opted for a strawberry shake. My sister ordered the Farm Burger with the fries and water. Seeing that the place was not busy we chose to sit in the front dining area. It wasn't long before our buzzer began to vibrate and like a well trained ninja I spring out of my seat (tip toeing through the air) and within seconds I was at the pickup window. Did I mention I was starving? Both meals were served in black baskets lined with tinfoil. The aroma alone had me hypnotized and the roasted peppers had me salivating. Typically I reach for the condiments and begin to pour on the ketchup, mustard or what have you. This time something told me to give it a whirl as-is. Just add the lettuce, tomatoes and red onions and try it as-is. So I go with my instinct again and I am glad I did. Wow! Juicy, tender, flavorful and delicious. The combination of the arugula, pesto, red peppers, mushrooms and the fontina cheese hits you all at once like a fierce side kick to your taste buds. I am talking about (Whack! Pow! Bang!) as if I were in an old batman episode. This was one heavenly treat and I must say that I found a new favorite. The Fontina Burger takes first place knocking the Haunted burger down a notch. The onion rings on the other hand were ridiculously crunchy to the point of over crunchiness. To put it simply I should have stuck with the standard fries because those were awesome. I almost lost a hand as I kept sampling my sisters fries and the shake, oh the shake... wonderful. I love shakes especially when they are made with fresh seasonal fruits. Delicious! I liked the fact that I did not have to add anything to this masterpiece. It was perfect as it was served, hot, juicy, tender and wonderful. I was very impressed with quality of the food and the establishment is fantastic. I honestly wish I had known about Joe's Farm Grill much sooner! Thank you for the great experience... expect us back real soon! ",0,0,0,0,1

 My wife and I went to Napa on Providence for a friends birthday, so we went with a pretty large group. This really gave Napa the opportunity to shine from a service standpoint and they did. The water glasses were always filled, the service was pretty fast considering that we were a large group and the people. The food was great and very well priced for what it was. Being that it was Sunday before 2:00 my wife and I ordered off of the brunch menu. She ordered the Napa Benedict, and I ordered the Herb Fried Chicken and Waffles. My wife's Benedict was amazing, the eggs were poached to perfection, and the hollandaise sauce tasted amazing. The herb fried chicken was to die for. It really was some of the best friend chicken I have had in my life. It was crunchy, moist, and very flavorful. The waffles were great as well. My only complaint was that I do not believe that there was enough syrup provided for the waffles. Now to the one down part about the meal, the drinks. Although the drinks did taste great, they were almost your typical drinks that you can get at other Charlotte restaurants. My wife and I both started with pomegranate mimosas, they were what you would expect from a mimosa. After one I switched to a beer and had a big boss beer which comes from a brewery in Raleigh which I am very familiar with. The beer was exactly what I would expect from the beer. I have had it several times before having went to college in Raleigh. The biggest problem with the drinks though is their price. For what you get the drinks are very over priced. My beer was $7, the most I have ever seen this beer charged for anywhere else was $4, and the mimosa's were $8 a piece. Really expensive when you think that at other places in Charlotte bottomless mimosa's are $10. I know that it isn't a fancy one like a pomegranate mimosa, but still, the mimosa was not that impressive. Other drinks that were on their menu had a higher cost than the food. I under stand a great wine costing that much but the drinks that were $10 or more I just didn't understand. Overall the experience was great and I loved the food. I am very likely to return to Napa again, but probably not likely to drink there. ",0,0,0,1,0

 So glad to have found a bar on Mill Ave. on New Years Eve with decent drinks specials. Didn't get the food, but did 5 beers for $10. Twice. Seemed to do the trick. Otherwise, this place seemed like the run of the mill (no pun intended) boring taco shop in a college town. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Sat a the bar on a Saturday night for a special event birthday party for a friend. Food was good (special prices for us), mixed drinks were a bit weak, and the bartener was terrible. I'm so tired of the bad bartenders in this town - and here was another one. And he's probably not even union, so can't use that for an excuse. We pretty much had to beg for any service. Such a shame, with so many bartenders looking for work, that they keep someone like this. Always gets a bad mark in my book. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I really didn't want to give this place two stars, but I'm trying to be fair and honest. Just to be quick and to the point: Food was wonderful. Service was pretty bad. Now to get into it a little more... My husband and I went here on a Tuesday evening. It was pretty normal; people were there, but not busy. The decor was really cool and gave a nice, laidback feeling. The owner greeted us and was super awesome and personable. When my husband asked what beers they had, it started getting weird. The owner asked, ""Well what do you like?"" Well, he likes all different beers, so it depends. He then brought the bartender over, (which was the right thing to do) and when my husband asked what kind of beers they had, he asked, ""Well what do you like?"" Ugh. (Look, I'm a bartender, and I understand how annoying it is when people want you to rattle off all the beers you have. But my husband just wanted some sort of list.) So perhaps they should work on listing the beers somewhere. Anyway, onto the meal- The food....was awesome. It took a very long time to come out, but it was good. I had the jerk seared ahi tuna salad. My husband had the jerk filet mignon (cooked perfectly) and both dishes were great. We also ordered the mac and cheese which was a hefty serving, and very tasty. Service checked on us numerous times. So after we were done and our plates were taken, our server never came back. He never stopped by to ask about dessert (which I was planning on getting). We kept trying to make eye contact with him, but nothing. We were ignored by everyone. So about 15 minutes went by when the fabulous owner came by and asked if we ordered dessert. I laughed and said we were never offered. He brought the server over and smoothed everything over. Basically- the food is wonderful, and so is the owner. The service needs to step it up. We will be back only because of the food. Oh....and I got my dessert. ;) The carrot cake is AMAZING! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Good food, Great happy hour pints are all $3. The Nachos are super good and tons of beef. Wasn't aware it was a $4.50 up charge for beef tho. Very disappointing. I don't think its worth the price ($13.50) for an appetizer, but they def do give you a lot of beef. It taste amazing too. The Beer Wrap Turkey Sandwich is phenomenal. About 12 bucks but worth it includes bacon. My favorite beer is the Kilt Lifter, great aroma and hoppy taste. They brew all there own beers and only serve them. So don't expect to get a Miller Lite there. The Scottsdale location is a nice chill place to relax at. I believe they even have a reverse happy hour that goes til 1 am. Great place I will be back!!

 There aren't many restaurants in Vegas that saddle between take out and pricey, so for that reason alone, it's nice to see Bonanno's here (it's next to Walgreens on Harmon Corner). Staff were friendly, inside is pretty relaxed for being Strip-adjacent, though I'd recommend sitting outside to gaze at the beauty of CityCenter when it's not too hot. We ordered the sausage pizza and linguine bolognese, a half-carafe of the Nero d'Avola, and had a healthy supply of garlic knots. Everything was tasty, classic Eye-talian. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Went with 4 friends, and we shared quite a bit so I got to try most of the menu. The biggest problem across the board was the service. All our questions about the menu were answered with terrible one word answers, so we ended up with many dishes that were nothing like we expected. Best example...when I asked, ""What is the 'Stuffed Guinea Fowl Supreme?"" The first answer I got was, ""It's like a chicken."" My next question, ""But what is it stuffed with? And what does the 'Supreme' mean?"" The response I got was simply, ""Dates"". That was pretty much how all our conversations with the waitress went. But terrible service aside, the biggest disappointment was the food itself. Nothing was necessarily BAD, but nothing was particularly GOOD or memorable either. They also seem to love their foam machine a little too much. While making cucumber foam, or pea foam is interesting, the textural element was used as more of a novelty than a compliment, as it was used on half the dishes. The meal ended appropriately. When asked, ""What's the 'Death by Chocolate'?"" The waitress responded, ""Mousse"". Turned out it was chilled and closer to ice cream. Overall I would have given the meal itself closer to a 3, maybe even 3.5...but such horrible service is inexcusable. They also did not open our wine until we asked, and they placed the white in a bucket, but with NO ICE! Unbelievable...There are far too many good restaurants in Montreal, especially in this price range to waste your time here. Nice ambiance though, the interior designer gets 5/5. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I used a Groupon or Living Social to try this place last Saturday. It is a very small coffee shop by day and wine bar/eatery at night. There was a private party that night but they were not over the top loud. The wine was pretty good but the ""melt"" which was a combination of a pizza and flat bread was very disappointing. I ordered the sausage melt and received what looked and tasted like little sliced hot dogs on top of cheese, no flavor at all. They also measure the wine (which is a fairly small pour) with such precision you would think an extra drop would break the bank. The rest of the menu was not appealing and the place lacked any decor or charm with it's very bright lights and no music. The staff is very friendly and I spoke with the owner who was VERY nice and seems to be trying to work out some of the kinks but until they get a better menu with good food and at least a bit of atmosphere I won't be back.

 After seeing the battle of burger show on TV I anticipated eating a delicious juicy hamburger. My husband and I both ordered the classic and shared the curly fries. After almost an hour wait at our table for our burgers the waitress came back announcing the cook had lost our order. She quickly took our order again indicating she would talk to the manager for our inconvenience. Our burgers came quickly but both were under cooked. We politely just ate them and learned our fries would be compensated. After eating we asked each other was is good, would we come back, and would we recommend it to others. Sadly with our entire dining experience our answers were no to all the questions. Vegas is a very competitive place for vacationers to spend money and quality service is expected. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Now that I have had Dom DeMarco's a few times, I think I can give it a complete review. I am not a fan of thick pizza. It's doughy and unpleasant and I just do not enjoy it as a general rule. Fortunately, Dom DeMarco's has a solution for those friends who cannot agree on a crust: Two styles of crust! One is a Regular crust (New York thin) and one is Square crust (thick and cooked in a cast iron pan). Despite my aversion to thick pizza, Dom DeMarco's really does it right. My friends insisted we try one of each, so we got the Big Apple in Square and the Di Fara Special in Regular. Both were really awesome. Naturally, I loved the thin one best (Di Fara) but even I have to admit that this thick crust is good and the combo of meats on the Big Apple was out of this world. The Eggplant pizzettes were money! Little, crunchy eggplant slices covered in parmesan and ricotta. Yes, please. Also enjoyed the Tomatoes & Burrata cheese appetizer. Two criticisms: (1) we had an incredibly long wait due to the Cougar Den in the bar, but Dom DeMarco's is popular with a certain age group of women in Summerlin, so what are you going to do? It's worth the wait; (2) that thick crust does not heat up well. It was a grease ball the next day, so eat it while it's hot! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Just tried this place recently for brunch on a Sunday. The price was about $33, which was more than I had expected. The place was okay. Nothing too special. I tried the brunch buffet at Wicked Spoon for $22 which I thought was a better deal. None of the food choices really stood out to me. They had a good amount of desserts but my favorite was probably the Butterfinger gelato. Other than the food, the place was nice and clean. This buffet isn't that crowded. When I went there was no line. Though everything was just average, the service was pretty good. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've been to other Fatburger's in the valley and this one is by far the worst. Came in here at 5:50pm to order two burgers to go, one medium and one large, with cheese and no tomatoes, and some fries. The cashier was very nice, however don't be fooled, a nice face does not mean a sense of urgency. My order was punched in at 5:59, and since I know the burgers are make to order, I expected the food to be out in about ten minutes. Wrong. The female cashier and the male cook had absolutely no teamwork whatsoever. They were all over the place and were literally falling apart, with only 4-5 orders on the screen. There was food just sitting under the heat lamp for a good ten minutes before she decided to grab it and hand it off. At the 20 minute mark, I was getting impatient, because an elderly woman got her order (two burgers) before me, and she ordered after me. I politely asked where my food was, and the cook said it was coming right up, and that if I had a complaint, it wasn't their fault because they were short handed. That's a load of BS in my opinion. I manage a high volume restaurant and any competent staff can handle multiple orders, ESPECIALLY when the whole menu is essentially burgers and fries. Even with two people, with proper teamwork, sense of urgency, and a sense of priority, they should be able to handle a work load, especially since it is what they are trained to do. 6:34 comes around and I finally get my food, along with one other woman that was waiting for her orders to come out, which had a long ticket time as well. The cashier went up to me and said if I came in next time and said they botched my food, I would get a replacement. I don't want a replacement. I want to go into a food establishment, and get my order within a reasonable time period. 30 minutes is not acceptable ticket time for two burgers that weren't even made properly. Other locations are good, just this one needs some serious improvement. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I'm in from out of town, and I'm so surprised and disappointed about the level of we received here during a quiet Sunday lunch hour. Our waitress gave us indignant responses to every request, with visible eyerolls to things like sharing fajitas. When an order came out completely wrong, she said ""Sorry for the mixup, but I don't control the kitchen"" and made no effort to correct the order. Had she showed any effort or contrition, the error really wouldn't have bothered me, but she actually seemed to act like it was our fault. It really disappointed me to have my dad treated like this on our family meal together on my final day in town. Please train your staff better and treat customers with any level of appreciation or helpfulness. ",0,1,0,0,0

 If you are reading this review on Yelp, you are probably not an avid Camelback hiker. Below are some recommendations for a first-timer: I agree with the moderate-difficult rating for the Echo Canyon Trail. Nothing super dangerous, but you do need to have moderate endurance and balance on your feet. Try not to carry anything in your hands as you will need them for navigating over rocks and boulders. Two spots have handrails; don't be afraid to use them. Get there early (before 6am) or later (around 8am during the weekday) to avoid parking far away. Also, don't let the people that run up and down the mountain intimidate you (I was passed by a woman walking her chiaua on her way down). Everyone is friendly and the views are worth it, so take your time. A really fun hike in the city. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Had a WONDERFUL spa experience at Spa Mio. I booked an aromatherapy couple's massage here for my fianc \ u00e9's birthday and we were very taken care of from the moment we walked in. The staff here is attentive and a really nice mix of friendly and professional. I especially liked that they encouraged us to take advantage of all the facilities, and never once did they try to up-sell us on other services. They didn't have to: it was so pleasant that WE were the ones asking about other services. This set the stage for a really relaxing afternoon. Our aromatherapy massages were AMAZING. Probably the best massage experience we have ever had. They gave us a choice of oils, the room was the perfect temperature with relaxing music playing. The masseuse didn't chat unnecessarily (which is rare these days) and the massage was great. Anyway, it just goes to show that when a spa goes above and beyond all expectations, people can't wait to come back. That's the effect their staff and beautiful ambiance had on us. Pure perfection. We are going to make this a monthly date! This is one classy spa! ",0,0,0,0,1

 this was my first visit. there were a variety of items on the menu. you could order from a selection of sandwiches, which seemed fairly priced at $5.50-$7-ish or create your own ... but for the create your own, you got charged for every little thing, including 45 cents for each veggie, which seemed a bit odd. you could easily create a $9 or $10 sandwich, without a side or a drink. there were lots of sides including pasta salad, chips, asian noodles, and some yummy, homemade desserts. it was a bit chilly so soup was in order. i had the sonoran rojo clam chowder, which was not at all what i was expecting. the broth was very thin, not thick like clam chowder normally is. there was a plethora of vegetables and huge chunks of potato and a minimal amount of rubbery clams. it looked more like vegetable soup than any chowder i've ever had. i also ordered a side of asian noodles, which appeared to be angel hair pasta, some sesame seeds and a very artificial asian marinade. i got a free chocolate chip cookie, which was small and hard, but free so can i really complain? both items i ordered were odd. the soup was better than the noodles. maybe i ordered the wrong items? counter service was simply unfriendly. i wasn't impressed, but i'd like to like this place. i'll probably try it one more time, ordering a sandwich, when i'm in the area, very hungry, and in the mood to spend $10 or $15 on lunch.

 Yay for good skin exams! I admit I was a slacker for the past few years and didn't go for my annual full body check at the dermatologist. Therefore, I was a little nervous about my appointment. Not only did I have a few freckles / sun spots / moles that popped up over the years, but I had a baby too... and god knows what happens to your skin during a pregnancy and beyond! Anyways, I knew it was time for a visit, but I didn't have time to trek to North Phoenix to the sister office of Scottsdale Dermatology Ltd (see my review for that office here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenix-dermatology-ltd-phoenix#hrid:XPNvqTMH5MP_ME0Fem3Yrg), where I'd been before, so I trusted my husband on this one and called this location instead. The woman that answered the phone was super friendly and scheduled an appointment for me to see Kendall Jenson, PA-C the following week. When the time came for my appointment, I followed the directions to this office on my Yelp app, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how close it was to where I live and work, and there was plenty of shaded street parking when I arrived... bonus! I didn't have to wait too long once I arrived, and I had a good experience. Luckily, Kendall was not too concerned about any of my freckles/sun spots/ moles, and he answered all of the questions I had for him. Before I left, they had me self address a post card that they will send to me for my annual visit next year... hopefully, I'll keep up with my annual appointments going forward. Now that I have a dermatologist nearby, I really have no excuses. What's yours?! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I was in Las Vegas for a company trip (haha, pretty awesome) and decided to go to Palazzo to check out what they had going on since I had not been. After walking about a bit my friends and I got a bit hungry. We decided to consult the Palazzo directory and spotted Emeril's Table 10 restaurant. We just couldn't pass up this opportunity. We got that and were seated immediately, it was a Thursday around 11am, people are probably still passed out from the night before from partying. Here's what we got: Spicy Sesame Pork Dumplings: I thought, potsticker or soupy dumplings, but they turn out being Char Siu Bao (BBQ pork bun, baked) looking items. Biting into one was like biting into a slightly denser puff pastry and then you are greeted with the spicy pork filing. The word dumplings and look made me think chinese style, but its more of a fusion between french and chinese styles. A good one worth trying. New Orleans Fried Shrimp Po-Boy with natural cut fries: If you like shrimp, this one is a must. The shrimp are a good size and are lightly battered and fried to golden. I don't usually talk about fries but they thicker cut fries here must be double fried because they aren't soft like at most places. They are crispy on the outside and smooth and fluffy on the inside, and so good. Slow Cooked Pork Po-Boy: Nice sweet molasses BBQ sauce in a freshly baked bread, with those great natural fries like above. The pulled pork was good but not stellar, the bread is what set it apart from others. Emeril's Banana Cream Pie: When the plate arrives, you are greeted by a 4-5 inch towering slice of banana cream pie with chocolate shavings, caramel sauce and whipped cream. The pie is made well, since it does not sag in any direction. I ran my fork into it easily piercing through the whipped cream, chocolate shavings and caramel, but when my fork met the banana cream, it slowed to a crawl as my fork made its way through the velvety cream and breaking up the pieces of banana. The final layer was the graham cracker crust which require me to exert a bit of sharp force and with a crunch, my fork made it through. I places the forkful of pie in my mouth and my senses were immediately bombarded with a rush of banana taste and aroma. The banana cream was velvety and just sweet enough. The mouth feel was off the charts because of the crunchy graham cracker crust, mixed with the banana cream, sweet slices of banana, whipped cream and nuggets of sweetness from the chocolate shaving and and caramel sauce. I was sharing this and I seriously wanted to order another slice because it was that good, but then I remembered I was stuffed and really shouldn't eat anymore. The major highlight of this meal was definitely the dessert. The Banana Cream Pie here redefined Banana Cream Pies for me. NOT TO BE MISSED, you will be sorry if you do. I make a very good banana cream pie, so I always try to taste test banana cream pies where ever I go and nothing ever beats the one I make. But this one! Hats off to Emeril, that man knows his banana cream pie. ",0,0,0,0,1

 OMG! This place is amazing! We came here after getting married and asking the concierge at the palazzo for an incredibly romantic restaurant. The food was amongst the best we have ever had. My husband ordered the truffle risotto ($75 for a main it worth it) which was incredibly creamy and flavoursome and I ordered the osso bucco where the meat melted in your mouth combined with the ceamy polenta and rich gravy. With the exception of the woman at the front desk who had attitude to the nth degree (in any other situation we would have walked away. She should not work there!) the service was impeccable.

 The best sweet potato fries you will have in your life! Served with powdered sugar and a honey-jalapeno aioli. Mouth watering!! The burgers were worth the $13-15 dollars.

The only down side was they charged me for a glass of water, other than that I would recommend this place, Even if you just came for the sweet potato fries! they were that good :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 I have been to this salon every two weeks for the past 5 months. When it comes to the nails they usually do a great job. However every time I have had one of the male techs do my nails they end up chipping and breaking within a few days. Also I know they have a customer rewards program however I have never once been informed about it or asked if I would like to join. I usually refer this salon to my friends and coworkers but I'm not sure I should be if they can't even remember that I am there every two weeks. They girls do a great job at nails I just wish they could remember that I come in as often as I do. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Restaurant Week gives me the opportunity to try places that I normally wouldn't be able to afford. It's low risk with a sometimes high reward. In this case that was true. I went for breakfast, so It may not be the most accurate representation of the food quality for dinner (it's really hard to make a terrible breakfast). I really enjoyed the personal french press coffee, juevos racheros were tasty, banana and marscopone french toast was as good as you think it was, croque madame was filling, and the service was exceptional. Because I went for breakfast on a weekday it was not busy and I got to sit outside. I actually went there twice in one week. The second time it was a perfect day and our server let us linger for about 2.5 hours and was the perfect amount of attentive without being overbearing. Two things I thought were underwhelming were the sugar doughnuts (just ok, nothing to write home about) and the bloody marys. Yes they make it at your table, but I don't buy into that hype. I don't care if you make it in front of me, in the bar, in the kitchen, or in the back alley if it isn't good. The bloody mary is underwhelming. I say skip the ""fancy"" at your table bloodies and get an extra entree to share with the table. ",0,0,0,1,0

 It's worth the wait!!! If you get restless, press your luck on the slots ;) It's a small counter that seats about 20 people. When we were there I never saw the end of the line. Oh man, the House Pan Roast is delicious! It's a huge portion...I couldn't finish it, I didn't complain when I had it for dinner too. Be careful with getting too confident with the amount of spiciness that you request for. I got a 6 and it was good, I was able to enjoy my food with a hint of spiciness. One of the fun things is that you get to watch your food get cooked in front of you. You can see all the passion that's put into each order. The staff is friendly and pretty funny, love it when they have a sense of humor. We also got the Bloody Mary Oyster Shooters, they were yummy too. I'll be heading back here! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Be careful not to double tip!!!!! The first time we came here everything was A-OK. No problems. I'm thinking, I'll come back again and review this place when i have multiple visits. Unfortunately, the second visit was the last visit for me. Our waiter took it upon himself to give himself a 18% tip automatically. We were just a party of 4 with a baby. I saw him do the same thing to a Korean couple with three kids. I cant believe he had balls to do that to a fellow Korean. Some Korean restaurants I go to take care of other Koreans preferentially. C'mon, you know it's true! At least, our waiter that day was an equal opportunistic,egotistical, person with an endeavor for shady business practices on all people. He took 18%...above average tip (typical for 6 or more in a party) for some lack luster service. He didn't even refill our glasses with water once. Maybe I wouldn't be so pissed if he just took a 15% tip or if there was something stating gratuity was automatically added to the bill...guess he thought highly of his level of service though. Hell, if he just refilled our water I would have given him a 20% tip. I was in the F&B industry, I know how it goes. Immaculate service earns 30% from me...easy. Maybe he thought he was the bombdiggity of a server or was just tired of foreigners visiting Vegas and stiffing him. Heck, I sympathize. Europeans and some Asians from abroad don't tip diddly. In addition to the tipping escapade, my sister asked our waiter for a bowl behind the counter. He was unnerved and said he would bring it to our table. 5-7 minutes later the bowl arrived. He was too busy calculating and counting his tips. No kidding! The bowl was right behind him. He could have just turned around, grabbed the bowl behind him and handed it to my sister. Unbelievable! I guessed that earned him his auto-tip, in his mind. Could be a new thing in Vegas too when 5 or more are gratuity included now. Would be nice to know If that's the case.Nothing about gratuity is stated anywhere and he failed to mentioned he added the tip already. Our bill just had the total. Almost double tipped him. Good thing we fought over who would pay. Wouldn't have noticed otherwise. Anyways the soondubu (tofu soup) here is pretty good despite only receiving a handful of banchan items. If you do come here though check your bill first. Or don't check it...maybe you'll receive average service and the auto-tip is OK with you. I highly doubt it though. That guy just does the basics and delivers your food. I can't believe it took another bad experience at a restaurant to get me to write a review on Yelp again. Geez! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I have been to this place for drinks and possibly food over a year ago. It was time to stop by for a casual dinner.

Hardly any greens, maybe half a chix breast, and mozzarella u could barely notice. Husband had chix parm: nice size dish he liked it. This is a cool place to have a drink but the food NO WAY.

 The three of us came here for dinner during a trade show, and we were all disappointed. My friend's petite fillet mignon was dry and sinewy, whereas my steak was way too fatty.

The reason I'm not giving one star is because of the dessert- we had the ice cream/sorbet shot sampler. Very innovative and tasty, nice presentation too!

 Went Vegan for MUNDO! Loved the chic decor, definitely my type of spot. Hidden, modern with a full stock bar. Don't forget the extensive Spanish/Mexican inspired Wine list. Appetizer: 5/5 Since your given complimentary tortilla chips and salsa, It was a given duh that we'd order GUACAMOLE. I'm a sucker for guacamole, super fresh and creamy.* Wine: 5/5 Wine from around the world, I chose Casillero del diablo, merlot 2008, from chile. Thought hmmm Spanish inspired Chile wines a must. Smooth and refreshing, with a little bite. The color was a dark ruby red. Vegan Entree: 5/5 I appreciate restaurants that appreciate their Vegan customers. So when I noticed they offered Vegan entree's I couldn't resist being a Vegan for one night. I ordered the garden quesadilla with manchego and oaxaca cheese, 3 bean relish, green chile pipian drizzle. This was surprisingly super yummy. The pop of hot spices and fresh ingredients YUMM.

 Way over rated restaurant. We had dinner here Sunday on the patio. The service started out pretty good until I asked for a sample of one of the two beers they had on tap. The $2 charge was not worth the sample. Bottle beer selection was better than most but still pretty weak. We had a beet salad that was pretty good, a caprese panino that was bland, a baked penne that was equally bland and slightly overcooked, and Margherita Neapolitan pizza that was soggy.

 Maxim deserves the great reviews it gets. The other Vietnamese places I have visited in central phoenix have been disappointing but Maxim lives up to its reputation. The food and service were just right and the prices are very fair. The shrimp and pork summer rolls and accompanying peanut sauce were fresh and tasty. The sauce in particular is delicious and the peanuts on top add nice texture- I suggest adding a dollop of the chili-garlic sauce to the peanut to make it even better. The pho is wonderful- great broth, pretty good meat. I appreciate that you can choose from two types of broth (beef or pork) and that there are so many different options for ingredients (pork or beef or chicken or seafood). The size of the regular bowl is just right and you can upgrade to a larger size if you are really hungry. My only complaint is that they give you lemons instead of limes and a side of lettuce?

 After having experienced Sushi Muramoto catering some of my old company's events, My wife and I figured we'd give it a shot. First off, the pros. The food is above average and there are definitely some stand out signature items. The braised pork belly is outrageously good and they have several specialty rolls that would definitely join my top tier list. The cons are the service. I'm hoping that my experience was a one time negative, but our dinner took 2 hours! We're pretty certain our waitress forgot to enter our order but we're not sure because we'd get periodic items every 15-20 minutes. It was one of the most frustrating meals I've experienced and they most likely won't get the chance to make up for it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Am a devoted fan of the miso salmon--the buttery miso sauce and the salmon grilled to perfection pleases me every time I order it. My sister had the herb encrusted salmon with the rosemary potatoes, which she really enjoyed (although I wasn't excited about the flavor or presentation). My bro-in-law had the house salad and the wasabi seared ahi. He's from Hawaii, too, and enjoyed the fresh ahi after scraping off the wasabi-flavored crust. I tried it and found it very much lacking in seasoning, it was way too thick of a dry crust, and there was no sauce so we had to doctor it up with some soy sauce. Service is very attentive, as usual, and we had a great table with a nice view--thank goodness, or I might have lowered the amount of stars. Kind of disappointing visit this time around and I wanted so badly to have my family rave over this place. The mango key lime cheesecake we ordered was supposed to be the redeeming dish, but it was way too sweet and the coconut added to the impacted hard crust didn't help, and it seemed like all the flavors didn't combine well enough to make this worthwhile ordering. I guess it's all about ordering the right, signature dishes, which we failed to do in 3 out of the 4 tries we had. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I went here for brunch with a couple girlfriends. It is a cute little place on Willy Street and I was excited to give it a try. The interior is very homey and features a lot of weird pictures and eclectic decorations. They have a bunch of board games and giant chess pieces up on a shelf. It is a fun place! On the downside - it was freezing in there! They were very clearly making an effort to minimize this by having the main entrance be the back entrance so people coming in to the restaurant don't open the door and let the air in, but it was still pretty chilly.

 no greeting - 4 staff members stare into the abyss of their electronics (personal) - I purposely wait for someone.

""so what's the problem, then?"" - I explain that the AC goes off and on.. on 1 minute, off 20 - and this goes for a 4 hour drive. I am miserable, again, ""so?""

 I go back and forth with Cantina. Sometimes I go and its great all around, food, service, etc. Other times the service is laughable and food stinks. Or just one is off. I was craving a margarita (not an alcoholic I swear!!) So before dinner plans at Good Food my friend and I said we'd meet here. I got there first and walked into the bar area where the couches are. There was someone cutting fruit and he didn't look up so I asked if I could order a drink from him. Sure no problem. So he makes my drink and tells me its $7 and change but I ask to start a tab. Then my friend called and asked me to order him one, so I went back to the bar and there was a woman there now too. She apologized and said she'd get me some chips. She brought the drink to the table and again mentioned the chips and I told her its fine I'm not in a rush. When the chips came they were fresh and salty and warm, all good things! The salsa however was unbearably salty and really think, like paste not watery like it usually is. We had to take it off the table because I kept absentmindedly sticking chips in it and then recoiling from the salt overload. We told the new server when she came by and she was just like ""oh really?"" After another round we closed out to meet my sister for dinner. Check was $30 for 4 house margaritas. Is it just me or does that seem pricey? I'm not usually one to scoff at the price of drinks but that just seemed highish. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I used to enjoy coming here. But man, what happened? Did management change, because everything was awful. The host was rude. Our server Brian had attitude and didn't seem to care about our needs. The food was meh. My friend ordered a house margarita and it tasted like pure rubbing alcohol. So she sent it back and said she didn't want a different margarita. The manager came over and tried to get her to buy the more expensive margarita because it would taste better. I'm sorry, but shouldn't the manager just bring her a complimentary margarita because she was unhappy with her previous one? He lingered longer trying to get her to buy one. The waiter didn't notice our drinks needed to be refilled, so we had to keep reminding him. I ordered some spicy chicken tacos-- the chicken tasted like it had been marinated in Frank's Hot Sauce, yuck! I also asked the manager to put the chicken in corn tortillas instead of the flour tortillas. They charged $2 for doing that!!! What the heck! I've never experienced that. My friends enjoyed their food though. No one was friendly and the manager just seemed clueless. I won't ever be going back. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I'm really confused by this airport since ... not going to lie but PHX isn't exactly a GIGANTIC airport, so I don't get why they had to make their rental center 15 minutes by bus from where the terminals are and arrival area(s). It's very bizarre since airports only do this to anticipate massive expansions, and ... maybe I just don't see that. Judgements aside ... There are quite a few places in this airport that are well rated and are good places. This is contradictory for airports since most airport food, drinks, etc. suck. I like that they took the time to ensure that good places are here, or invite those businesses so there's something to do when you're waiting. Overall, the efficiency is *ok*, the bathrooms could use some updating, and it isn't the best airport I've ever been to ... but it isn't the worse either. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Okay-maybe i stayed in the old tower because all the pictures on here do not look like the place I stayed at. I'm reading these reviews and I see i should have asked to stay in the newer part of the hotel. Maybe they reserve the crap rooms for people that use the travel sites (like me). I reserved via Expedia and pre-paid, i was asked upon checking in if i wanted to upgrade to a junior suite for an extra $25 a night. I thought it was a fantastic deal so did it. I just got home and checked my credit card statement and found out it wasn't a great deal, the Palms charged me the base cost (which i already paid) plus the upgrade fee. They are in the process of refunding the $200. I got to my ""non-smoking"" room and it stunk. The room was really dated and the television was just like my tv from college that i just got rid of. Old style big clunky television that was all static. My white comforter had a suspicious blue stain all over it... I will say the bathroom was decent-except for the leaky shower head. The entire old tower stinks like smoke and rattles all night because of the clubs, i was on the tenth floor and woke up at four and the tower was shaking from the music (i had been at another club drinking all night, so it must have been loud to wake me out of that alcohol sleep). The food court that is located in the casino is decent and there is a movie theater that i wanted to check out. The casino is way off the strip, so it's about $10-15 for a cab. I ended up mooching off my friends and staying in their fancy room at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, which was not stinky and where I will be staying next time I'm in Vegas. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We decided to install an entry gate for our house. We wanted a gate that didn't look too busy, yet not so plain that it looked like prison bars. We decided on a design that was simple with knuckles spread throughout to break it up. Unfortunately when it arrived, there were less knuckle than we had agreed to and it look like the prison bars we didn't want. We got a hold of Angel, he had the guys take a picture for him to look at while on the phone with us. He acknowledged that there weren't enough knuckles. He gave us two options, for the guys to take the gate to return and fix it or to take $150 off the remaining bill. We decided for them to fix it. One of the guys suggested instead of knuckles, adding four casters along the plain bars. They wouldn't have to take the gate and could come by within the week to finish the job. They returned to finish the job, they installed the casters, also put a plate along the hinge portion and a sturdy door stop to keep the gate from hitting the garage wall. All without any additional cost. The gate looks great and we are completely satisfied. Thank you Olson Iron and Angel for making sure we were satisfied. They also told us to call any time if we ever have any problems and they would take care of it. I know it's not an empty promise. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I have very mixed feelings about this place. When we walked in at first, I was almost positive that we had gotten the wrong address - even though the sign in front obviously said ""Thai Noodle"" - because the place looks nothing at all like a restaurant. It is literally an empty room with a few fold-up chairs/tables strewn around, a fridge in one corner, and the cash register at the other corner. Seriously, this place is NOT AT ALL an eat-in restaurant, and I think they would serve themselves better if they were to advertise themselves as solely a catering/take-out service. Also, I took a peek into the back ""kitchen"", and I honestly wasn't sure where the cooking was being done. All I saw was a really dark, dirty looking room filled with empty vegetable boxes - plus maybe a glimpse of the one, lone cook in a white jacket. Hygiene, anyone? Still, they had decent reviews from yelp and other websites, so I decided I'd give it a try. My friend ordered a chicken/rice dish and I ordered a padthai (my go-to thai dish), and it took us about 15 minutes to get the food. My friend's chicken rice was delicious, but I thought my padthai was at most average. The noodles were a little overcooked and broken up into little pieces, which made it difficult to eat. Otherwise, nothing really stands out about the dish, although lemon juice helped brighten up the flavor. I may try a few other dishes from Thai Noodle in the future, but I think Noodles&Company's pad thai is the clear winner on this side of Madison. One redeeming factor: they have a bowl of DELICIOUS guava candy sitting at the cash register stand. I would have dumped the whole bowl of candy into my takeout bag if no one had been watching...

 I heard about this place from some of my friends and of course on TV. So when I had the chance to visit AZ, I just had to hit it up, since I LOVE burgers. As you walk in the door, you are greeted by good looking girls in skimpy nurses outfits. When you are seated, everyone must put on a hospital robe before ordering. There are even mirrors behind the counter that are angled up for a view of the waitress's sexy nurse costumes. So far so good.... My expectations were very high but they did nothing but disappoint with their burger. Their all you can eat fries on the other hand were absolutely amazing (I even went back for 2nds). They do have a great concept here, but they just have to work on their burger recipe. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Food is great but the service at the bar is horrendous. Last few times we have went the bartender was unable to cope with even a half full bar. Went back in August on a Friday and asked if we could sit outside at one of the tables in front, bartender told us yeah but we would have to come inside to order things because it's too busy. There were nine people in the bar section. It was nice out so we sat out there anyway. When our food was ready she knocked on the window and I had to go in to the bar and bring our food out to the table, so it's got a nice authentic touch of waiting your own table yet paying someone else to do it. Eventually realized that she was doing this because she was screwing a waitress out of the table and didn't want to be seen. Classy. Same one was working the last time we went, it was dead and she still couldn't keep up. Everything she said to anyone was prefaced with ""give me a second I have to get this for these people first"" and then she would look at her phone. I mean I don't expect the best service on a Friday night somewhere but when it's dead and you can't even come close to keeping up what the hell are you doing. On the bright side we got bread with our meal for the first time in the last four visits this time so.... progress I guess. The food really is great especially the mafalda but man the service has gotten to where it isn't worth it. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I am SO ecstatic that my favorite ice cream shop is BACK!! =] ...not in Vegas, but I first went to Ice Pan in Redondo Beach about 4 years ago and they closed that location. I was recently creeping on Yelp when I saw that Ice Pan had a location in Vegas. It was a matter of hours before I found myself drooling before the menu. The cute Asian women took my order. I ordered a combination of fruit, milk and toppings. As soon as I ordered she suggested I picked a different variation of flavors. I took her advice and boy oh boy am I glad!! Now, don't be fooled by her petite size. She chops, cuts and throws the blob of ice cream on the ""ice pan"" to mix and freeze the mixture. This in itself is a show that brought a crowd of people watching her. But really, this is the best ice cream I have ever had. It's fresh, and the perfect amount of sweetness. The only way I could describe the amazing goodness is HEAVEN! I want to officially welcome Ice Pan to Las Vegas and will continue to visit and eat healthy and sweet. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Unimpressive breakfast. Cool spot, olive oil, outside seating, love that its a local business, etc...with that's said: I had breakfast sandwich on focaccia. Way to much bread, probably great for dipping in olive oil, terrible for sandwich. Egg was in similar shape to that on an egg mcmuffin, small amount of bacon and organic tomato (which you pay extra for). Was cold in middle, etc. my wife had omelette, which was again average at best. Small portion (which is fine, portions are too big in most restaurants anyhow), but she finished half, and we decided to call it and have an early lunch. I suppose its probably the equivalent of going to a steakhouse and getting the chicken. Could be a real cool spot, seems like you would be able to eat a good country style breakfast there. We definitely did not. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I tend to stay away from restaurants that have a celebrity chef attached to it. I wondered how much time did Bobby Flay actually spend in this restaurant? I admire Bobby Flay and I have had some of the dishes he inspired and like what he does with flavors. I figured Mesa would be a safe bet when I was asked to choose the place for a group of six. It was better than safe, it was excellent. The service was excellent. The gruop wasn't in a rush, and the waitress didn't rush us. She spent a lot of time asnwering questions without a hit of annoyance. I had the coffee rubbed Filet Mignon and it is probabyl the best steak I have ever had. I didn't need a steak knife, it fell apart. There was something about the coffee rub that is going to compell me to go through hsi cookbooks in hopes I find what exactly is in it. Other notable items on the table were Goat Cheese Queso Fundido, heirloom tomato salad. Both were excellent. The side of mashed potatoes was really good. This is a top notch restaurant! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Bomb!!!! Live music friendly staff and really good affordable food...and really great prices. So far so good, I will be checking in on this place from time to time to give you the honest updates you require ...plus there beers where ice cold off the tap. Update 1. restrooms where very clean and the place was 75% full. Update 2. Rosemary chicken takes the longest to cook of all things on the menu, per out waitress and it came out half cooked pink in the middle, but the staff was great about removing it off the bill and making sure we got something else, in a timely manner because they did not want anyone leaving hungry or upset and offered 2 free appetizers on our next visit... so stay tuned for the next time we go to this place it is fairly new and will be given a second chance. Plus as a footnote the rest of our for was fantastic !!!! Note to Willy, if you would pre cook the chicken by boiling in salted water and cool or remove the bones by d-boning or better yet what I would do, is: use a Panini press grill and you would get the cooked in record time with the grill marks and (no brick needed).

 Oh Pittsburgh..... I think I might have ruined myself by living in California: I can't seem to find much good, innovative, FLAVORFUL food here. Way more misses than hits as of late for me. I understand the economics of a restaurant and that they need to turn a profit, but the price is too high for what you get...period. I'm not a cheapskate or a poor student, I just know the flavor/quantity/price balance is off. There's innovation here, but it could go SO much farther with a few simple tweaks. I'm know by some people as somewhat of a 'big eater' but when I went I wasn't that hungry, and ate 5 tacos plus fritos and queso, and could have eaten a bunch more. To their credit, the roast pork was good, but it didn't have anything else to set it off, no other textures or flavors to accompany. Also props on making their own bacon, I hope you like it extra smokey tho. I might return to try the things they were out of when I was there, the chicken and brisket, but it will only be for a snack The reason they got 3 stars instead of 2: THE HORCHATA!

 Have to say we were honestly really disappointed. Considering all the other glowing reviews, we had really high hopes, but the service really ruined it for us unfortunately. Just two of us for dinner and there were only three other tables seated when we got there, yet from the point of taking our order to actually getting our meal was an hour and fifteen minutes. No exaggeration. The soup came out within a few minutes and then... nothing. When the food finally came out, one of the sides was no longer available. Waitress asked what we wanted to replace it with, but couldn't tell us what the options were and ultimately we just said forget it. The table beside us and the table behind us both seemed to have almost identical experiences in terms of ridiculous wait times. The table behind us still hadn't received their food when we were leaving and were complaining to the waitress. Aside from that, the food we did get was tasty, but I ordered the ribs and have to admit I was really expecting more than just two. They were fall off the bone tender though. The cornbread, as others have said, was a huge portion and amazing. The dumpling soup was great. The sweet potato pie was piping hot and crazy delicious... highly recommended. I'd be willing to try it again, because the food really was good, but maybe just not on a night when I'm drop dead starving. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I would expect more from a hotel mogul such as the Donald. With such amazing restaurants in Las Vegas I don't know why anyone would eat here, aside from convenience. My coworkers and I were beat after working a trade show floor and convenience won. I made reservations for three on a Sunday night for 6:30. I understand that this is not the prime time for dining in Vegas but this joint was Dead with capital D; no reservations would have been needed. The menu had some tantalizing choices, among them a $29 prix fixe which my two coworkers went for and seemed to be pleased with. I on the other hand, was seriously disappointed. I ordered the caesar salad--just fine, nothing amazing, and the pasta which was a carbonara cream sauce with cured meat. My pasta was so salty it was inedible. I understand that this type of pasta is going to be salty but this made my blood pressure skyrocket and my hands swell so much my rings started to cut off my circulation--after only six bites (I tried!). Absolutely disgusting, and I LOVE salt; I couldn't eat it. Our server (if you can call him that--another bus-person/server brought all of the food/drinks out and cleared all of the plates) kindly removed the offending dish from the bill but only after trying to patronize me by saying the dish is salty by nature (duh, dude but you taste it and tell me it is supposed to taste like a salt lick). Overall, I was totally unimpressed. An empty room, unenthused staff and inedible food=big fat NO. Go somewhere else. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Weak attempt at creative cuisine. I like Asian fusion however this place falls short. The sushi is minor league. The ambiance is cafeteria-like. The service staff is very unpolished.

 With its remodeling, this Walgreens has undergone a strange and wonderful transformation that is probably best viewed at 11 p.m. on the night before a major holiday. I may have to go back on Christmas Eve to confirm this hypothesis. The deal here is that drugstores, convenience stores, dollar stores, grocery stores, and discount department stores (Target, Walmart) all want each other's business and are gradually transforming into one another. So this Walgreens is sort of a baby Walmart: smaller! cuter! friendlier! oh-so-adorbs! let's chuck it under its sweet dimpled chin and buy lots of seasonal candy! While rival CVS has gone the route of wide aisles with cheerful-yet-strangely-useless signage, Walgreens is packing the merchandise in. The experience is much more like the drugstores I remember fondly as a child: narrow aisles, tons o' stuff, and you never know what you'll find. It has gone hogwild for minor convenience electronics -- the stuff like car adapters and chargers where it's a pain to figure out what store even to try. Also: walls of Ferro Rocher! There may be a real niche here for ""what I want is too specialized for QT or Circle K to carry it, but if I have to face Walmart or the grocery store or the mall, I'm gonna cry"" shoppers. Keep an eye out for the house brands that are now being featured prominently (nice!, de-lish, savings with a smile), as the pricing on these can be really, really good. In a sensible move, this Walgreens has recognized that people who are buying cat litter, batteries, lipstick, cold medication, bourbon, and orange juice at 4 a.m. are not people in any shape to figure out how to queue. The cash registers are approached by a cattle run built from candy and small-electronics displays, and as a person who's recently endured the Camelback/16th CVS's Queue of Mass Confusion, I am grateful that there is no ambiguity about where to line up and who's next. I want to see what happens with the displays when Christmas is no longer dominant before I get too giddy, but this store looks to have become a lot of fun. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Anyone who's ever read my reviews will be able to tell you that I love a good steak, live for cheese, adore a good wine and enjoy a nice, stiff cocktail from time to time. That being the case, Alan Albert's falls into Stephy play quite nicely. It's got the feel of an old school steakhouse and I don't know about you, but when I go to Vegas, I like to explore the history and at least dabble in the feelings of the days of old there. Sure all of the modern hoorahrah is great, but that place has history and at Alan Albert's you still feel a bit of it. The waiters are dressed as steakhouse waiters should be, in nice white jackets and know their meats. They also have great sense of humors, since I imagine living in Vegas you'd have to. On one of my trips here last year. we got an old Irish man who rapped us the specials since clearly we exuded the 50-cent vibe, what? Yeah, it was random, but this is what I love about the place. The food is awesome. Steaks are of course their signature dish, but the seafood fare is fantastic as well. Lobstas baby! And if you go, ask if they have the lobster bisque. Sometime they do, sometimes they don't, but G-D Damn is that some good stuff! Use the bread to clean the plate, mmmm mmmmm! Also, like any old school steakhouse, the sides are a la carte, so make sure to try the creamed spinach(if this spinach thing ever let's up) and definitely get the asparagus as their hollandaise sauce kicks the ass! Wine list is also pretty good, but the martoonis are fantastic and they know how to do a dirrty one without tasting like you are stuck in an over-saturated ""olive"" garden. So go check it out. Not cheap, but definitely a nice meal in a cool place with great service and no one will say ""You're money"" here. Also, it is kind of hidden. If you are taking a cab, the cab driver should know, but just know that it is on Las Vegas Blvd but kind of towards the back between two buildings. You'll see :) Enjoy! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Everyone I know raves about this place and for me, its just meh. Probably because I can't find anything I really love on the menu and its kinda greasy like Whitney B. says. The pasta servings are huge and you'll get at least three meals out of it. I do like their chicken wings - we usually order from here for big gatherings and everyone loves them. What I do love, is you're treated like family here and I like supporting local businesses that treat you right. ",0,0,1,0,0

 OK so I made a mistake...tried a new place prior to checking out Yelp!!! Reason being as we knew there was a sushi place around the corner from our house however could not think of the name nor locate it on google. So we said what the hell, we are here let's check it out. When we walked in the place was empty, we were the only customer. Hmmmm? OK so was around two o clock so maybe the lunch rush had passed? First time dining here so I ask which is your top seller boba tea since they have a variety of flavors of boba smoothie and teas. Her response was ""No ""No"" you order what you like??? Are you freaking kidding me? Wow... I ordered the crunch shrimp tempura roll, crab, avocado, shrimp tempura, cucumber. I asked that they leave out the cucumber. What a disappointment, the amount of crab was almost non existent, did not taste or see any avocado, tasted like a plain white rice roll with crunchy flakes. No flavor and they were skimpy with the eel sauce which would have helped with flavor if I could have dunked it in some. I also ordered a strawberry splash smoothie boba, this was good! It was not a comfortable experience, we were the only customer and the two ladies working sat at a table staring at us the whole time. It was ridiculous! Beyond insane staring! Have no clue why either? Almost to the point of being offensive. I am a customer not a criminal, no need to stare me down every bite, every sip. Maybe they made a bet on which one of us would throw up the nasty specialty roll they call sushi first? lol No sushi chef on duty, was a server lady and a lady that took forever making our two rolls. This place is bad in many ways! The only savior is the boba smoothie was good. That alone is not enough to ever get me to come back. The bad: Service Food Quality Portion Offensive staring from staff while dining. The good: Boba Smoothie We could not wait to check the Yelp rating and knew it would not be good after we experienced what we did dining here. Never...Never...Never again!!! Please do not waste your time or money here, I speak the truth with no exaggeration. It is truly horrid! Pictures of our visit are attached, notice the smiles are prior to taking a bite. Looks ok, but taste bad. I will go without sex before I eat here again!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I had been tossing it around in my mind whether or not I wanted to review this place. So, I'm just going to do it. I had the take-out beef ribs, collard greens, black eyed peas, sweet potatoes, and the hush puppies. I am really picky about ribs, and you could tell that these were not slow-cooked. They were sort of tough, and not at all how I like them. I didn't care for the sauce much either. The sweet potatoes were good, and so were the greens. Someone stole the black eyed peas from me, so I didn't taste them. The hush puppies were fabulous though. I dunno. I really like ribs, but I would never have them from here again. I don't know if it's worth it to me to go back and try something else. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is an ideal place to eat dinner at a fancy place without feeling the need to be in a suit and tie. Reservations only apply for indoor seating, if you want an outdoor seat you'll have to wait. Mon Ami Gabi was a very enjoyable dining experience. From the moment we were seated, our server with the most welcoming smile, made sure we were tended to throughout the evening. To start, we had a complimentary rice/pea salad along with their bread and butter. For apps, we tried their escargot which was utterly garlicky and delicious. Don't forget to use the little bread you have left to dip it into the left over sauce after eating the escargot. I think this came with six pieces. I got their steak bernaise. The cut of this steak is thin but it is surprisingly filling. This steak came with a bernaise sauce that you can't stop dipping it in. Each of their steaks come with frites. They were unlike any frites I have ever had... very thinly cut... a cross between hash browns and the end pieces of McDonald's fries. I can't say I was wild for them, but if you like crunch, these will certainly hit the spot. I also got an order of their mac and cheese which was a decent portion for a side. It was a little TOO cheesy for my taste but then again, I was starting to come down with a sore throat so that could be it. I will definitely plan a visit here again next time I'm in Vegas!

 Loud and rambunctious. Fun and funky. Las Vegas needs more places like Hash House. It's a more corporate take on a fun place like Jacque-imo's in New Orleans.... in that... it's a local joint with lots of leeway for the waitstaff to be themselves. Good music and a great vibe. It was so refreshing to see men and women of unconventional beauty having fun with their clothes for work. One server looked just like Frieda Kahlo (on purpose) and our server looked straight out of a 50s car hop. The restaurant as a whole, is a feast for the eyes. And a feast for the stomach too. The portions here are HUGE. I mean... it's like circus freak show huge. I think it's a gimmick and I'm horrified at how much waste must be created each day here.... but the WOW factor when the dish arrives at your table is undeniable. Quality of the food is very good. It's a cut above your average breakfast restaurant and the menu items are creative and fun. A little hung over from last night's party? No problem. Order the menu item that is basically a very large beer and a side of bacon. My first breakfast here was bread pudding (Snicker flavor) with ice cream and a cup of coffee. I'll post a pic on Yelp.

 I had been to this place years ago. And its just as expensive as I remember!!! I was not sure if I should give 3 or 4 stars!! My wife ordered the seafood platter as an opener!! It was big and so was the cost. This is how I described it, OK and expensive while when I think of Florida where its amazing and cheap!! My wife still liked it!! I ordered the Baseball cut fillet Mignon!! I wanted it med-rare. Have of it was but the other half was well done and dry!!! Strange!!!! It was good and I enjoyed my meal and the wine. Dessert was a white chocolate cheese cake which I had a small sample and it was great!!! I am easy going but the boss was swearing his head off at the staff and was freaking out some of the customers!! He should just be careful with the F words. Does not bother me but it did others and this is a fancy restaurant!!! For this reason 3 stars instead of 4!!! ",0,0,1,0,0

 DON'T EAT HERE ! This place was so dark! I couldn't read the menu! I asked both the waiter and the manager if we could turn up the lights and they just said no. They brought me a flashlight to read the menu! Stupid and just plain silliness. The guy and his girlfriend had to get out their phones to read the menu. We walked out. **NOTICE** the trending details for this place has gone down dramatically over the past 4 months. What does that say!!

 I've been here dozens and DOZENS of times over the last 25 years. 5 stars without a doubt. Standouts are the Italian beef with ""lots o hot"". Their cheese fries are absolute perfection... here's why. Put fries in a basket, smother them with cheese sauce, put another hand full of fries in basket, SMOTHER AGAIN WITH CHEESE SAUCE. When you are done with these cheese fries you are looking for more fries for the cheese, not more cheese for the fries. Then, when you walk out, school girls and boys break into song and birds start chirping. Oh, I have to mention the cheese steak. I don't like the standard way they do it (beef, onions, cheese) BUT if you ask for it ""Philly Style"" they do it with their cheese sauce that they add extra cheddar cheese to. Yum yum yum.

 We arrived in Vegas and were stating at a nearby Hotel. We wanted some Mexican food and stopped by here. They were playing the football games on every tv. It was loud but the games were good. We don't drink so we ate the food. It was good for America style Mexican food. The tacos were tasty but defiantly not authentic. My wife had the taquitos they were not the best but eatable.

I looked on yelp and found this shop and arrived there at 4:pm. I thought no way were they going to get to it this late in the day. They were prompt,professional and courteous and sent out their diesel truck technician, Ben, who diagnosed the issue. They called my warranty company got the part authorized,ordered and installed by 10 am the next day. They shuttled me back and forth between an RV park while my truck was up on blocks. The owner and every employee i dealt with were professionals. The repair shop was orderly and spotless, this is not auto repair it's auto surgery! I can't say enough about them. i wish i lived closer to have all my cars serviced there. Honest,reliable,professional service.. the way all businesses should be operated. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This used to be good for me 6 years ago but there are now quite a few competitors for the pizza king crown. All of them have left this place in the dust. We always get a well done pie with extra cheese and basil. The sauce tasted very watered down and that pretty much killed the pie for me. It also irked me big time to sit right next to the huge picture of Yankee Stadium (ha!). The service was above average and they did offer a bottle of red for half price so it was only a whopping $10. That was a nice surprise. The pizza might taste better if you had 2 bottles. I noticed a lot of customers going for the calzone and I will consider giving that a try the next time. It's not like it was awful pizza but so many places have raised the bar in town so much that this wouldn't even be my fourth choice. I know I'll be back here at some point since my wife still loves it but I am keeping my fingers crossed hoping this was just an off night. ",0,1,0,0,0

 In the span of 30 minutes I saw two different things that will keep me from ever going back to this mall. I raced into the mall having to use the restroom badly and when I got into the bathroom I saw a girl standing up, leaning against the bathroom stall, almost asleep (high as a kite), having peed herself. The cleaning woman who was tending to the bathrooms almost walked right by her until she saw my disgust and decided to see what was going on. This girl was so gone, a friend had to come in and sit her down on the couches by the food court, urine staines and all. Next, I was upstairs walking by what I thought downstairs was a free car, until I saw police lights on top and a couple standing by the car. I glanced down to the first level and realized that the couple was taking a photo of the male with his hands behind his back pressed up against the car. What a way to make a mockery of the AZ police Metrocenter. The ONLY positive is the Maricopa Animal store in the mall. THAT. IS. IT. I feel bad for the people that have to work here and see the disgusting people meander into their mall. Clean it up! P.S. After talking about my experiences at the mall with a friend, she said she'll never go back because last time when she brought her kids. Apparently, a raunchy rap music video was playing in the food court, which glorifies the idea that women are objects and can amount to no more. In a FOOD COURT??? I get that your main demographic is high kids that pee themselves in your mall, but people DO HAVE KIDS. Inappropriate. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Ohana was my first experience with anything proclaiming to be Hawaiian. Parking is always a bit tight as the Starbucks and other places close by bring in quite a few people. Once you step inside the place is clean and bright. They have a flat screen showing ESPN to distract you while you wait a few seconds for someone to take your order. The person taking my order suggested non-fried offerings so I ended up ordering a Half and Half plate: BBQ Chicken, Garlic Shrimp, and a drink. Under $8 for it all, not bad. I get my drink cup, head to the fountain dispenser and one dispenser is broke. I ended up getting Sierra Mist which is meh on a good day, but this was flat. Bleech. My food gets brought to the table and after a couple of bites I get up and get some soy / teriyaki sauce and some Sriracha sauce because while the garlic shrimp was good, the BBQ was woefully disappointing. I was able to cut the meat with a plastic fork and knife but that's the only praise it gets. As for BBQ, this is more like the stuff Sysco or US Foodservice sells at the lowest price point and says the sauce will make it into real BBQ. Sorry folks, my 14 year old niece's first attempt at BBQ with too many charcoal briquets and way too much lighter fluid had more taste than this stuff. And I can't forget the double scoop of the most boring white rice imaginable After having this I'm thinking the closest I want to get to Hawaiian food is to go to the store and buy me a fresh pineapple, slice it and call it a day. (Seriously I'll keep looking as this was not even close to what I had hoped for!) 1 star for service, 1 star for the garlic shrimp. ",0,1,0,0,0

 i am using all capitals to bring attention to 702 pools. the first 7 months with 702 pools were great, but then something terrible occurred. the 702 pools employees who are hired by the owner are not knowledgeable. they change frequently too. i had to pay $1500 to fix my pool because the ph of the pool was not properly maintained. it ph was allowed to be too acidic. this resulted in copper being stripped from the heating elements and it stained my entire pool plaster purple and ruined the tile. the pople who repaired stated they had never seen a purple pool in 20+ years of caring for pools. the owner of 702 pools, nick, is refusing to take responsibility. when i brought the problem of staining to his attention, he did not know what was wrong and stated he would ask someone. he later returned dropped something in the pool to remove metal staining, this further lowered the ph of the pool and a different pool company told me had a couple more days gone by i would have lost my entire heater system. i took the water for analysis after i dropped in 25 pounds of baking soda to get the ph up, but they told me i had ""dead water"" and to drain and refill my pool. nick does not have the knowledge he should have for someone who is in charge of pool services. i am now doing the chemicals on my own. guess what, it is not hard at all. avoid 702 pools. prior to the damage that occurred i had too many warning signs because of staff not caring properly for pool. the coupon or groupon is not worth what it could cost you and now i will report him to his licensing board to get my money back.

 Felt I needed to provide an update for my 2nd visit to Karma Kafe. I didn't make my breakfast ahead of time like normal, so on a whim I stopped in at Karma Kafe to see if they made breakfast sandwiches. Pleasantly surprised by the choices, I usually try to stick with ham/egg/cheese breakfast sandwiches and that's what they had. I think I saw the choices for meats were ham or turkey on the breakfast sandwiches. When I placed my order, I was asked if I wanted regular eggs, egg whites, or egg beaters. Great selection and I ended up with an egg white (salt/pepper), ham and colby jack sandwich on a croissant. Honestly it was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I have had in a while, and I won't think twice about stopping in if I forget my breakfast again in the future. Price-wise it was great, under $4 for the sandwich and definitely generous with the sandwich size. ",0,0,0,0,1

 This was my first Cirque Du Soleil show so I didn't really had any expectations coming in. I was just ready to experience! Right away, when entering the show, you are given a sneak preview of what it might be like. The people scanning your tickets are all dressed up in costumes. As you enter into the auditorium you are immediately in awe of the amazing structures/stage set up thing going on. I felt like I was entering like a Final Fantasy video games! It was beautiful and got me really excited for the show. As you are sitting in your seats waiting for the show to begin, the actor's/actress/people part of the show walk out on the outer stage thing doing some acrobatic tricks, spinning upside down and running around trying to scare people. It's pretty fun and really draws/connects the audience I think. Just a couple minutes before the show begins they do a staged reminder that cellphones and photography is not allowed during the show. The show starts off and it is absolutely amazing. The moving stage, the athleticism of everyone in the production, and the music blows you away. The production and performance of the show was just out of this world. However the story slowly kinda got lost towards the middle part and I was really confused on the ending. I had no idea how everything was resolved. I know this was the revised ending since the tragic accident but I wish they had made a better ending of it. My friends and I was so confused that we had to wiki it!! My boyfriend loved the show though cause he didn't really care for the story. If you enjoy an amazing performance than you would probably enjoy this. But if you kinda care about the story well, probably should not get your hopes up. Just enjoy it for the performances. I would come back and watch it again IF they fixed the ending. I just watched the youtube ending of the climatic battle that they removed and wish they kept it or modified the new ending better.

 This place was amazing! After reading the reviews on here, I was nervous that I would get my hopes up and be let down. So glad we decided to take a chance on this little hole in the wall. I have to say, this restaurant has the best pasta dishes I've had in the states. I can honestly only recall one other pasta dish I had that was better, and that was in Florence, Italy. The waiter was great, very kind. Service was incredibly prompt. He made some great recommendations to us on which dish to choose. The atmosphere of the place is the only part where I think they might be able to improve, and they wouldn't have to do much. It's still great- small, family owned/operated, byob was very fun; I just felt that if they perhaps dressed it up just a bit with the decor it would add more sparkle to this gem. But I loved how it was so small, only a handful of tables, very relaxed and casual. Overall- best Italian food in AZ, especially for the price. I will absolutely be returning. ",0,0,0,0,1

 I wouldn't classify this place as an Italian restaurant. It is more like an east-coast eatery. They serve cheese steak and beer and oily garlic bread and chicken wings. Stuff like that. My polla al limone was different from how I've had it prepared at actual Italian joints. The lemon flavor was almost imperceptible, and the sauce more creamy than normal. Also too much garlic. They probably don't realize that they are supposed to bread the chicken, and then saute the mushrooms in the same pan with the breaded chicken. That's how this dish ends up with a ""creamy"" sauce. The breading sort of comes out into the oil, while the mushrooms let out moisture, and it turns out great when prepared in this manner. There is not supposed to be any actual cream in it, but Times Square just pours in the cream. I dunno, I'm just not a fan of really heavy food or sports-bar-type food. It would be OK if they would market themselves as an east-coast eatery, rather than an Italian restaurant. Other than that, the prices are normal and the service is good. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place has gotten ridiculous from the first time I went. If you want to skip to my horrible visit just read up on my last experience. My first experience was pretty good. For AYCE, my favorite dishes are: Superwhite Tuna Garlic Tuna Uni(one order) Sweet Shrimp(One order) Sashimi Platter(One order) Baked Mussels They also have hamachi kama but the size of the freakin thing is a like a whale and has an extreme fishiness to it.(yes i know it is fish but the smell on this one is a bit too much). Came a second time for lunch. My first thought, 9.99 for AYCE !?!?! what a freakin deal. Of course there had to be a catch. The AYCE menu for lunch is limited to crappy california rolls to more variations of a california roll. You can practically get NOTHING with fish in it. They do however let you have the option of ordering your normal sushi for 1.00 an order, not a bad business idea i suppose but it definitely does not leave you satisfied. MY LAST experience was for another dinner AYCE. Let me first start with my first order. I began to list out all the items that I wanted. ""3 super white, 3 garlic tuna, 3 salmon 3........ BAM interrupted. The waitress said she'll put this order in first and just walked away. In my head, ""aren't you writing this down? is it that hard to remember"" Then she comes back and tells us that we should take our time since its the AYCE is not timed. ok, I get it, we shouldnt hurry, fine. So we wait and wait and finish our first plate which was very quick. Then attempt to order again. Same thing again, but this time, we only ordered 2 items. Ok, i think i can gauge how much i freakin eat lady, i understand that business is bad since no one was there but you can you NOT tell me how much food i can freakin order since its AYCE. THE WORST PART, and on top of everything, each piece of sushi, and including the roll i ordered was PACKED with rice. we order a yellow tail jalepeno type roll with some sauce which essentially was LARGE AMOUNTS OF RICE WITH SOY SAUCE, and a itty bitty piece of fish. I would not be complaining if the amount of rice in the roll WASN'T OUTRAGEOUS. After eating my meal i just wanted to scream, STOP BEING SO CHEAP !@#J!K@#!@, unfortunately i may have to come back here to get my mayor-ship/dukedom back on foursquare and yelp *sigh how sad....

 Boy what a huge disappointment. Fried rice and 'scallops' that had a pink color..... Not kidding. What makes fried rice pink? And tasteless. I would never consider returning to this place. Soup was muchroom flavored broth. Salad would've been OK if it wasn't for the large inedible chunks of lettuce 'core'. I was VERY unhappy leaving here. Never again. Scallops were irregular 'pink' pieces that had no taste and were not cooked correctly. NEVER again. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I am so in love with this place!!!! Its close to my gym and house and when i have early moring running to do my husband and I always stop here for something to eat. The food is made from scratch and you can tell! The servers are always friendly and well kept. I think they need a bigger location they are always full of diners inside and out. My husband loves the cordbeef hash he said it's the best in vegas, I always get the jacob's slammin platter, the price is cheap compared to all the food you get. The potatoes are nothing you have ever had anywhere! I always get a bagel for my bread choice with spread. I am yet to finish all my food because you get some much! This is hands down my favorite breakfast spot! I bought a discount card from my kids school so last year they had discount buy one get one 50% off, Iove a place that helps out it's schools and provides great food and svc. Its also dog friendly if yo want to eat outside with your pet not sure if they are allowed indoors ",0,0,0,0,1

 Based on the location, and a lover of sushi, I had to check it out. I ordered the miso soup, which was good..and warm, and the sushi deluxe, which was 6 pieces of nigiri and a tuna roll. All I will say is I paid for a pile of rice. There was so much rice, with small to decent sized fish, not too great. Lunch for $20, that wasn't that great, definitely wasn't worth it. I'll stick to my other uptown sushi spots. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Excellent food, all the way around. This is the kind of place you expect to have paper towels on your table, and you do, and you'll need them and love that you do. I lived in DC for a few years and there were a lot of pollo a la brasa joints all around there that I became addicted to, and miss. This is very close in flavor, if a different cultural tone. Totally recommend this for an inexpensive, delicious, and low-maintenance meal with close friends. Knowing basic Spanish is probably helpful. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Walking into MacAlpines is like stopping the clock and turning it back to the turn of the century. You can get ice cream goodies there that you simply can't get anywhere else reguardless of price. My wife and I have been here bofore but only for ice cream. This time we ate at the little tables in the back. Service was quick, efficient, and very nice. Wife had a Reuben (she always has a Reuben which makes her an expert on Reuben's I guess.) She declared it one of the best she's eaten. I had a seafood salad sandwich. My sandwich was delicious. Both came with really GOOD potato salad. I mean good!! After that we each had an ice cream soda. A real ice cream soda. Rose's was cherry with vanilla ice cream. Mine was chocolate soda with Chocolate ice cream. We were both stuffed to the gills when we left. Total price: 30$ including ice cream, and drinks. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This past summer I took my fianc \ u00e9 to the Blue Hound for his going away dinner. I made my reservation online and simply noted that he was heading to Afghanistan and asked for a table with a nice view. We arrived and were taken to a table with a fabulous view! I was thoroughly satisfied, but had no idea what was to come. We ordered the Chef's Geek Out and were absolutely blown away by the service, food and accompanying drinks. Little did we know that at the end of our meal the Chef and staff would bring a card to the table, shake his hand and express their sincere appreciation and ask that we please come back when he returns. I can't recommend Blue Hound enough and we will gladly return when he gets back! ",0,0,0,0,1

 We bought the LivingSocial deal to try this place out a few months ago but haven't had a chance to try it until this morning. We came right around 7:45am and were the 3rd table in the restaurant - a blessing because we wanted to make it to work on time after our fancy breakfast (anything compared to a homemade shake is fancy). We seated ourselves and were assisted within a few minutes. I would say both our orders came out within 15 mins - not too bad for what appeared to be very fresh, hot food. I read the previous reviews and figured I would try something that was a ""typical"" breakfast choice for me: the Mediterranean omelet. I considered creating my own (I'm one of those slightly picky people about what I have in my omelets) but felt the short but mighty ingredients in this omelet would hit the spot - spinach, garlic, tomatoes, and feta. What's not to love? I skipped the variety of potato options in favor of an English muffin. Although I love me some potatoes, I'm really glad I did! I love love love cold pressed coffee and was very interested in how they prepared their Over Easy Iced [coffee]; with cinnamon and cardamom, followed by sweetened condensed milk (the best thing ever to add to coffee) and a hint of mint. I could envision how the first three flavors would work together but didn't know how the mint would come in (and I'm not normally a mint person). My husband, a complete sucker for almost any configuration of eggs Benedict, settled on the Deli Eggs Benedict (I called it - the salami was calling his name). He chose a half/half order of regular and sweet potato tots and eventually caved, at my insistence, for the iced coffee too. I loved the homemade strawberry jam that came with my English muffin - not too sweet and a strong strawberry taste. Our server told us the jam they were using before were not up to par for them so they switched to making their own - works for me! I polished off half my English muffin before I turned to my omelet. Personally, I thought my omelet was fantastic and exactly what I was looking for. I was worried that it would be one of those three egg behemoths that is more appropriate for lazy Sunday mornings but thankfully it was normal-sized (they have three egg omelets though, if you are interested in a behemoth meal). I loved the combination of flavors, it wasn't runny inside (not something I mind but I know there are people out there that need their eggs cooked through), and I felt there was a good balance of all the ingredients, not too much or too little of anything. I complemented my omelet with a few (okay, a puddle to the side) of Chohula hot sauce - you can never have enough of that stuff! I ended up really liking the iced coffee - since it was cold pressed there isn't the normal bitter after taste that you can some times get with coffee. Instead the after taste was a marriage of cream and mint with just a hint of coffee. I thought the mint could potentially muck it up but I found myself really liking the after taste. I was worried about having major garlic and feta breath but the coffee (emotionally, I can't speak for real life) put my fears to rest because I was able to wash the tastes away and leave only the cream and mint. It was less sweet than I expected, but then I didn't feel like I needed to either - and I normally put an obscene amount of sweetened condensed milk into my coffee or black tea. Overall, I was very satisfied with my meal. I'm not always a fan of eggs Benedict - the hollandaise sauce is usually too much for me in the morning. However my husband was quite happy with his meal - the eggs were perfectly poached and the man loves himself some extra sauce and it was plenty saucy for him. He can't turn down anything with salami in it so it was just icing on the Benedict for him (har har). The amount of taters he received was epic - it took up at least half his plate! I only sampled the sweet potato taters (How can you walk away from fried sweet potatoes?) and they were quite yummy. He assures me, however, that the regular tots were just as good if not better (he assures me he is okay but I'm not sure what's wrong with him - sweet potatoes are awesome). We had no issues with service through out our meal - we were checked on once or twice, which fine with us. Check out was quick and we were done and out of there by 8:45 am, a miracle for us (I am a SLOW eater). By the time we were finishing up quite a few tables had filled up, so if you want more of a quiet breakfast, we definitely recommend this to early risers. Our experience was good and we'll be visiting again to try other things as their menu is large and promising (loco moko, French toast, and the breakfast sandwiches come to mind). ",0,0,0,1,0

 Don't be fooled by their prices. These people will nickel and dime you to death. The tactic they tried with me was to keep saying the automatic payment didnt go through so there was an extra $20 charge for not paying on time. And then, since you didn't pay that late charge within 10 days there is another $5 charge on top of that. If you call to try to settle it, they are rude. I was even called a liar the last time. I told them I am not giving them another dime. They can put the little ding on my credit. I would rather have that than be extorted by these people again ",1,0,0,0,0

 I came here after my friend kept telling me how great everything is. I figured I would order the same entree my friend had previously enjoyed. I ordered the prime rib beef chili to start, which was really good. I also ordered a strawberry milkshake, which seemed to be made of soft-serve ice cream. The milk shake was average for $7. Entree, I got ""The New Amsterdam"" which even the waitress had recommended. The meat was overcooked and tasted bland. The best part of the burger was the pastrami. Below average burger for $18. It came with fries, which were also below average. My friend had ordered a pastrami sandwich, which I took a bite out of. As I had mentioned before their pastrami is really good, but the bread wasn't too good. Overall, if you are in Vegas there are so many excellent locations to eat at and there is no reason to waste your time or money in an average restaurant. I would never go again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 When I was having trouble finding Montreal's most famous Dim Sum restaurant, a la Maison Kum Fung, I ended up stumbling to this banquet style restaurant, which came recommended to me by some Chinatown locals. It's located on the 2nd floor of a Chinatown mall, where it was an absolute zoo when I arrived. The stairs were filled with patrons all waiting for their number to be called and the crowd only got thicker with every stair step to the top. There was almost little-to-no room to move and getting to the front to collect a number felt like an impossibility. Not to mention I had 10 people with me and no reservation. I some how made my way to the front, where I managed to play nice with the manager, who was busy handing out numbers to folks. A crowd of close to 100 became a crowd of no more than 15 in a matter of minutes, due to the diligent seat assigning from the hostess. Talk about a deceiving wait, I almost convinced the group to leave for another restaurant but was glad I stuck it out. My group was given a nice private room overlooking the restaurant and not a moment too soon, since we were all starving. Service was a little overwhelmed and was not able to clean our table or get food to us right away. The staff was a little slow and getting attention to the room was marred by the fact they almost seemed too busy to tend to us. Eventually the Dim Sum ladies wheeled their carts into room and managed to serve us heaping plates of Dim Sum goodies. While most of them spoke some broken French / English, most of them had a tougher time speaking Cantonese than they did Mandarin. Food portions here are ginormous. I've never seen Dim Sum in bulk like this, not even in the South where everything was fatter and greasier. The wu gok (fried taro dumplings) looked like they were the size of grenades and when stacked on top of eachother, looked like a hairy nest of eggs or unpeeled kiwi fruits. Ha Cheung (shrimp crepe) and Ha Gao (shrimp dumplings) were both also massive, to the point where it took only a few dishes to make everyone full. Zha Hai Kieu (fried crab claws) reminded me of jawbreakers and the Siu Mai was plenty thick with more meat than rice wrap. Bigger isn't always better though, as most of the food was just adequate enough not to be mediocre. I prefered most of the cart items than fetching items from the long table in the banquet hall area. Most of those plates looked old and overly greasy. Given the price and the portions, I think I could stomach another visit here in the future. The final bill was a modest one, which came out to be $120CAD for roughly 10 people. Surely the same Dim Sum rules still apply - come hungry, get a good spot, and arrive before noon. A reservation here probably doesn't hurt either, something of which I'll consider next time I bring a big group. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Imperial Palace Overall 2 Stars Let me start off with this, ""DO NOT STAY IN TOWER 4"". I repeat, ""DO NOT STAY IN TOWER 4."" Avoid TOWER 4 if possible. Well, get back to this later in the review, but it is very important, so we need to start off with that comment. Gold Medal - FREE Hotel Room Silver Medal - Dealertainers Bronze Medal - Friendly Staff I joined Total Rewards, it is the hotels comping program. You receive points when you gamble. The more you gamble the more free stuff you receieve, rooms, food, etc. Total rewards has other hotels in the program like, Paris, Ceasars, Bally's, Rio, Planet Hollywood, and Harrahs. I usually stay at Harrahs for free, but have not been to Imperial Palace, so I decided, ""Hey, let's try something new."" Here is when new is not always good. It is good to stick to what is familiar! Still it was a free room, so I should not be complaining. At least not TOOOOO much. I arrived after midnight and most of the rooms where gone. Here is where TOWER 4 comes to play. The hotel put is in TOWER 4. TOWER 4 was disgusting and far. It was a journey up a escalator, a walkway, a elevator, another walkway, and another elevator!! All to get to a room in TOWER 4?? What was the deal. The walk to TOWER 4 you hike through heavily soiled carpets and it smelled like MJ, weed, or whatever you want to call it. If you are wondering why TOWER 4 gets all caps, yes it REALLY was that disgusting!! This hotel is popping at nights!! It is like a college party. They have dealers all day called, ""Dealertainers."" The dealers are dressed up like out favorite singers, Britney Spears, Fergie, Dolly Parton, Shakira, and the list goes on. They even go on the platform to sing and dance. Right next to you while you are gambling. The staff was very friendly at this hotel. The next day we called the front desk to change rooms and the staff said, ""Just come down to change rooms, I will HOOK YOU UP."" Yes, that was their exact words! So Ghetto fabulous right!! haha They moved us into Tower 5. No need for the caps any longer. Tower 5 was closer and alot more pleasant. If you have a choice I suggest you stick to Harrah's. But a free room is still a free room. HAPPY DEALERTAINERING!!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 This location is [super] nice and clean! Indoor pool, indoor sauna, indoor track, and even a private lift room for the women who didn't want to be working out next to sweaty, grunting manly men! The private lift room for women was one of my favorites, just because it was never too crowded in there and there was enough equipment provided that I could get my workouts done in the room efficiently. This location was [always] busy at the times I went (which were usually either after work at night, or early in the mornings around 10-12PM). I would go as far as saying this is also a great place to meet new people and get some workout tips in passing. This location provides pilates/zumba classes and personal trainers as well. The only thing I [do] contest is the juice bar. LVAC on Sahara has more variety in their protein drinks than this one! ",0,0,0,1,0

 I love sushi, it is my favorite food so I am always hoping to find a good sushi restaurant when I go to Vegas. This place was okay. I think I am just too spoilt going to Sushi Deli in San Diego which is hands down the best sushi place on earth. The sushi here was just okay to me. I got the black truffle roll because it sounded awesome and someone else suggested it on here. It tasted like absolutely nothing to me. It wasn't bad, it just tasted like crunchy cardboard. We also accidentally ordered cold sake which is quite possibly one of the grossest tasting things you could ever drink.

 I came here for a quick birthday treat with my friends and family. Hoping that Serendipity would live up to it's bragging rights as a great dessert shop, and at a really good location, I was slightly disappointed. Now, first, lets just talk about the positives about the shop. I think the frozen hot chocolates does live up to its expectation. It is amazing, and delicious! We had the classic Serendipity regular hot chocolate, and the amaretto hot chocolate. My favorite was the amaretto. I would definitely go back to try it again, and I can almost be sure that sometime soon I will crave for it (come spring or summer time). Judging by the price comparison that was described on the photo captions on their yelp page, and their menu, it looks like the prices have gone up. We paid $13 for the hot chocolate size that fits for two. The portion is big and it was good enough for three people to feel satisfied, and less guilty. The onion ring tower was ok. It is seasoned with grated Parmesan, and it comes with a BBQ and Ranch as dipping sauces. We also had the lobster and artichoke dip with bruschetta slices. That was about $13, and felt really robbed. 8 small pieces of bread and miniature cup of dipping? I wanted to cause a scene for that ridiculousness! Now the bad side, the service is freaking horrible. I mean, seriously seriously bad. I'm pretty easy going and it's very hard to let me down, but on the day of my birthday when everything was going great the one thing that slightly destroyed it all was the service. The hostesses weren't really doing their job. We had no welcoming greet, no small talk, and I even saw frowns on their faces! Then, our server Jessie didn't really tend to us very much. She asked us only ONCE if we wanted more water and that was AFTER she gave us the check? She never even checked up on us, and the place was freaking slow! Her ""have a nice day"" just seemed so insincere and animated. I just felt like I was completely disregarded, and that I was some person who didn't deserve some decent service because I didn't ""look"" the part or something. I just felt so bad..i mean this is the second worst service I've ever had and the first was McDonald's! But I can't even blame them because they are probably slaving in the kitchen at a low paying wage! Work at McDonald's flipping burgers if you aren't gonna even TRY to give good service! For the price I fork up for freaking frozen hot chocolate I should at least get decent service. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I get that gambling is something to do in Vegas, but does it have to be everywhere? I mean even the grocery stores have sectioned spaces specifically for slot machines. Now, I do like to play a game of chance every once in awhile, but I also need a safe bet. Fry's happens to be one of those safe bets. The first thing you see upon entering is this hokey slot machine facade but don't let that deter you. There are some good buys to be found inside. And in their defense, at least it makes a little more sense than the cowboy theme at their Palo Alto location. I usually find a couple DVD's or games for the DS. And at the very least, I get to practice a little Guitar Hero or whatever game they have on display. So for goodness sake, if you've forgotten your phone charger or if you ear buds are busted, please make a trip out here instead of wasting your money elsewhere. And with the money you save, you'll have a little extra to play with when you go back to the tables. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This is a great option if you are wanting a nice dinner without completely breaking the bank. It can still get pretty pricey, but the entrees are in the $25 - $35 range making it possible to keep your check down if you don't add a bunch of extras. Our service was pretty good, I never had to wait very long for anything. I sort of made my own entree. I wasn't looking for anything very heavy. I was eying the ""Spaghetti Chitarra"" but thought the prawns sounded good on the Fettuccine with pesto sauce. I ended up with the Chitarra with prawns instead of meatballs. The pasta was delicious. It definitely tasted homemade. The prawns were some of the best I've had - super fresh and perfectly cooked. For dessert I really wanted the Crochette, but unfortunately they were out. We ended up going with the semifreddo al terrone, which was like a frozen meringue. Great flavor and not at all heavy. I definitely thought this place was way better than Shibuya across the hall. We didn't have reservations when we showed up at 6pm on a Sunday night before a concert, but they had a long wait when we tried to come on Saturday so I recommend reservations if possible!

 My buddy and I came here looking for something warm. The ramen place we wanted to eat at was crowded and we did not really want to wait so we tried out this japanese shabu shabu joint. Apparently, there are not that many shabu shabu places in Las Vegas so this one is supposed to be the one to go to. We entered the place and it felt underwhelming from the start. The restaurant is nothing more than 4 painted walls, a bar, and some tables. We were seated and we took a look at the menu. Swish menu: http://www.swishlasvegas.com/menu.htm To be honest, it is not the easiest menu to read and they use terms like healthy and hungry instead of small and large portions. My buddy and I have been binge eating all week so we weren't that hungry so we opted for the healthy size. The food came out decently fast and she turned on our burners. They use the can of gas burners here and ours didn't run out but i can see that happening and being awkward. But the food was just mediocre. The sauces seemed very salty and to me it just was very blah. The healthy serving size is really healthy. My buddy does not have a large appetite but even he was ready for round two of dinner after we left swish.. I guess if you are dying for shabu shabu in Las Vegas you should try here, but i've been to shabu shabu places that are much better than here. Oh, tourists this place is about 10-15 from the strip, in my opinion not really worth the travel. To each his own though. It is safe to say I most likely won't be spending my limited meals in vegas here. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Alright, finally got to see what the carpet looked like after the grand opening which was so packed we could not even see the floor. Very nice place for a date night and a cool bar to watch the big game and even the patio looked sharp. Very upscale is a little of what we need over here in the west side and I refuse to knock it for the crazy grand opening. We left after 10 minutes and ran up to Arrowhead Grill for dinner that night, but you cant fault a place for being to popular. They can't help that they are so good! Anyway, we double dated with friends in the area and we started with the shrimp appetizer on top of rice, I am not a big fan of shrimp but it was pretty good, we also all ordered 1 tortilla with butter (which had a sweet flavor to it so it made it special). I ordered the green chili chicken enchiladas......can I say heavenly? Hell yes I can, this stuff was great! The perfect amount of cilantro, sour cream, a tiny bit of spice, and just a great dish. It was in a 10"" low rim bowl with a side of white rice. My wife and her girlfriend both ordered the 7 layer salad which I guess was good because they both cleaned their bowls as well. My friend ordered the Argentinian steak....which I presume came from Argentina. My buddy let me steal a bite and I will be coming back for that since it was darn good, it had a fajita flavoring to it served with mashed potatoes. The menu overall isn't to large....it had a few salads, sandwiches, appetizers, only a few entries like the steak and enchiladas and a couple of fish as well. Then the bottom had a few options for their street tacos and then some desserts. I am so pleased with this place and cant wait to return. Once again a home run for Chef Charles!

 I was pleasantly surprised at this hotel. I was aprehensive to staying away from the strip, but ended up satisfied with the location and accommodations. Starters, the rooms were clean and well kept up. The atrium was a bit blah, but definitely relaxing. Swans swam about - I haven't quite decided whether they were nice or if they seemed a health hazard. The staff was great! A friend arrived before I did and the staff allowed her to check-in and get settled without needing me there. Breakfast staff were very efficient and HILARIOUS. They defintely brightened our day each morning and remembered us, by name at that! The staff manning the free cocktail hour (that's right, free!!) each evening was great too. Drinks were made quickly and properly. Although, they had a one drink limit seemed out of the norm to me. I was quite disappointed with the ""complimentary shuttle to/from the strip"" because it didn't run often enough nor long enough. Random hours, mid morning and afternoon with service ending at 9 PM. Strange for a city that never sleeps! I'll definitely consider returning on my next Vegas getaway! ",0,0,1,0,0

 This is one of those places you always come back to regardless of how you're feeling. In fact, you may start your day somewhere else and say ""let's grab a Negroni over at la bocca my brother""... And then my brother says ""ummm duh, does a bear poop in the woods?, does a priest love little boys? Does the average American owe more on student loans than what I owe on my car payment?""... Hells yeah let's go to la bocca!!! Come one come all. It's chill mixed in with great service and non pretentious bartenders who want to see you good and drunk just like I want!!! I'm looking to my right and there's a woman with a cardinals hat yelling at the tv. I'm looking to my left and there's a guy drinking a dirty martini. It's that kind of place. By the by, the food is top fu**%ing notch brothers and sisters. I just had a mini orgasm in my mouth. Don't judge me ",0,0,0,0,1

 The first time i came it was delicious and had fast service. Second time I went i ordered a breakfast sandwhich without spinach salsa or peppers. Got it to go. It took forever. And it had more mushrooms than anything else. It didnt even have cheese and it came with peppers. I even asked before getting the bag if she had made sure it was no spinach pepper or salsa and she said yes. What a waste of $9. All i can taste is mushroom. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Used to be very good, not great. When Robert was manager, we felt our business was important to Mac Shack Now they have changed the quality of the chicken that they use... so we stayed away for a while. Recently, we were compelled to try them again, we called to ask about the chicken to see if it was boneless skinless chicken... we were told yes... so we ordered to go... Got it home, skin all over what little chicken was actually in the meal... Not Good, they don't know the difference. We do ",0,1,0,0,0

 I HATE and I do mean HATE going to the dentist. However Dr. Dachs and his team always makes my visit a pleasant one. I always see Dr. Chris who I swear is not old enough to be a dentist, but he does an excellent job. The entire staff from the receptionist to the hygienist, to the Dr's. have all been very wonderful and patient with a wimp like me. They are always honest and upfront about every procedure that I have had or may need which hasn't been much (thank goodness). So if you are looking for a great dentist office, go and check out them out. You will be pleasantly surprised! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Located inside Desert Sky. The girl who did my hair did it okay but seemed like she'd rather be somewhere else and didn't really seem engaged and helpful. No tip for her. I went with my sister and my sis got a girl who seemed very helpful and offered hair tips and was really sweet. Mine seemed like she wanted to go as fast as she could, didn't care about me or my hair and she didn't even ask me if my hair looked okay after she was done. Cuts are a pretty standard price, every month they have specials which they display near the entrance. Overall a decent place. I think they could have some better customer service. I pass by this place sometimes and I see almost nobody inside. Might just go to Supercuts next time... ",0,0,1,0,0

 Applebee's What to say? It's OK-The 2 for $20 deal is Great!!! An appetizer & 2 entrees for $20!! We got 2 of them and a dinner salad. Appetizers: Boneless Buffalo Wings-HOT Spinach Artichoke Dip Entrees Ribs w/Fries x2 Quesadilla Burger A-1 Burger NO Dessert! ICED TEA all around. The service was sketchy-started off with watered down tea. The food was ok-at least the appetizers were-good bar food. The burgers were greasy,bland and had gristle in them. The ribs were bony,NOT smoked but the sauces were good!! Not bad for CHEAP eats but theres much better places as Suzie Q pointed out! ",0,0,1,0,0

 I've only been to the bar/lounge area so I don't know what the restaurant is like. Wish I had gone. So here is the review for Koi bar/lounge. The dance floor is surrounded by couches for VIP reservation so there was not a lot of room to dance on. The music is good but that depends on the DJ. The bar service was quick, but because it is small place, the service is faster. Ladies get open bar as far as I know on Sunday nights even at 2 am in the morning. The floor was so sticky because everyone spills drinks all over. I'm sure that it's like that at other clubs, but not as bad. As I am dancing (in floppy) it kept sticking to the floor. There's not much decor, but you really can't see anything until the lights go on. Koi has the potential, but it's not there yet. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We dined here w/ a large party @ 8:30 on a Sat night. This is important for two reasons. The first is they were out of the beet salad AND the bolognese pasta presumably b/c we were the last diners. But we were really surprised that an italian restaurant was out of a staple dish like bolognese. Second, when we got up to leave not one staff person was in sight. No ""come again soon"" or ""thanks for dining with us."". It felt odd. The bread w/ olive oil for dipping was awful. Really dry and tasteless. Ordered the Arancini balls which came w/ fresh tomato sauce and were very good. For entrees, GF and I both had lukewarm scallops/tiger shrimp over fettucini in a light tomato sauce. It really needed to be served hot. It was disappointing. Friend Bill ordered Zuppa de Mari which arrived, strangely enough, on a long flat dish and not in a soup bowl w/ out any broth. Zuppa? Not really. Coffee was delish - served tableside from a glass press. Wine corkage was still $7 and I think they charge so much b/c the place is so small and they don't want people to linger. There is potential here but they need to execute the basics better. I'm sure they'll figure it out the way their other two Regent Sq businesses (Mcbrooms Beer & D's Sixpax) have grown over time.

 Not really a lot of merchandise to browse and of course, none of the regulars from the show are in the store. They have a corner of the store set aside for souvenir merchandise and the place just wreaks of tourist trap.

 I have to say, I absolutely LOVE Chronic Tacos. I was initially hesitant to check it out, but ever since my first experience I've been going back consistently. These days I hit it up at least once a week for their lunch special (a huge burrito, chips, salsa, and a drink for just over $8), sometimes even twice a week. Personally, I prefer the chicken, but the carne asada wasn't half bad either. Once I find something I like somewhere, I don't tend to venture too far outside of my ""usual"" order, so I can't really comment on much else on the menu. That said, the service is always good, the food is delicious, and there's always something at least moderately entertaining on the tv's. Seems like they've got a good selection of alcohol and beers, but I've never really gone there with the intention of getting drunk. Overall I gotta go with 5 stars, keep up the good work! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Value, value, value! Ok, it's kind of silly to say that I've found a secret spot in Las Vegas in a restaurant that's been around 30+?? years, but that's exactly what The Hush Puppy is to me. The GF brought me here as she loves crab. She ordered the 1+ pound crab legs while I ordered the gumbo. Best gumbo I've had in town. Sorry, Palace Station...yours was way too salty. The crab is good and the salad was ok. The pecan pie though was awesome!! Wished the hush puppies had hot dog in them because I love corn dogs but the sweet butter goes well. Will be back soon!

 I really want context to be a good store, but they are such pricks and their selection never fails to disappoint me. I say this as someone who is committed I quality products, and is perfectly willing to shell out for clothes, a long as they meet my rigorous quality standards. But man do I hate these guys. I periodically go in, hoping against my better judgement their selection or service will have improved, but am only reminded why I hate them. Their selection: i wish they would actually commit to american made. While they appear very proud of vein from wisconsin, most of their clothing seems to come from japan. I am about as interested in Japanese denim as I am in Kobe bison: jeans are a symbol of America, so I want them made here. American made aside, they really only carry a few brands. Their APC jeans seen cheap to me, and everything else quickly approaches $300 dollars without backing the price with better quality. They should at least stock some of the more gold-standard brands: Raleigh, tellason, 3sixteen. There are a lot of good jeans available for $220, so stock them. The one time I trie on their jeans, I couldn't get any sizes even close: I'm a 32, and most of their jeans were way to skinny. I'm a very average size for a white male, yet they had almost nothing that for me. And their non denim clothes are a joke: a $400 Japanese hunting shirt? I wasn't aware the Japanese had wildlife to hunt or guns to shoot, so I'm not sure why they would sew shoulder patches and shell pockets on their jackets. Again, price without value. Filson makes hunting shirts too, but they look better, are made better, are mad To top it off, the guys their are such pricks. I always feel like i am inconveniencing them by shopping their. They barely answer my questions, and they are way too self impressed. Madison could desperately use a decent men's shop. I'm tired of doing all my clothes shopping in Chicago. Context just doesn't fit the bill. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Get. In. Finally, a local bar that is actually close enough to be my local, and is awesome enough to make me want to keep going back. Done. The Argyle has recently been bought over by the Brass Monkey (one on Drummond Street, one on Leith Walk). Whilst The Argyle is keeping its name, it's now part of this local Monkey chain. And the downstairs bar, that used to be called something like 'Below', is The Cellar Monkey. I was there this Friday past for their opening night, and it was rammed. This is testament to how great the place already is. However, this is where perhaps the only less-awesome issue was. As a result, you couldn't hear the music too well, it was reaaaallllly loud and with not-very-good acoustics it was hard to hear each other talk. I mean, we're all used to being out in a busy bar and having to talk louder. But this was more akin to club territory. Probably the loudest bar I've been into. The bar itself isn't too big either so it was quite crowded to get into. I was back again on the Saturday night and it was much more chilled. Still really busy considering it was its second night, but this time it was just the right amount of folk. You could hear the music, it wasn't too loud with folk nattering, and you could easily get a drink at the bar. The drinks are pretty cheap (everyone commented how cheap their rounds were) and they have a brilliant Bloody Monkey shot. With a good selection of beers, and even some cocktails on the menu, all they need is maybe some food or a pub quiz and I could see this becoming a very regular spot of mine. So I think as this places finds its feet / paws (what is Monkeys have anyway?) it'll be an awesome place to go for a quiet mid-week drink, or even an afternoon gander at the papers, getting comfy on one of the homely couches. Or for quite a few cheeky pints on a Friday or Saturday, but still enough of a neighbourhood bar that it's not going to be rammed with the usual weekend crowd. It's definitely what Marchmont was in need of. Mon' the monkey! ",0,0,0,1,0

 My mom wanted to go here for lunch last Friday & I was actually kinda excited, because it's been a few years since I last came here. Parking was a bitch & that was a task in itself! Any way, we made our way back to the hostess stand & was told there would be a 30 minute wait. For lunch, really?! We decided to sit at the bar where there was no wait. Lindsey was our server & she was so sweet, checked on us often too. For starters we ordered the bistro calamari & boom dip. I forgot how big the portions are, what were we thinking ordering 2 apps?! The boom dip was yummy but the calamari was just ok, way too much breading/coating! For our entree we decided to split the 14"" aunt margherita pizza (thin crust) & added artichokes. My mom only had a bite since she ate a lot of the apps, I had a slice & it was ok. Pretty bland in flavor, barely any cheese & the crust had a similar texture to cardboard. I took the leftovers home & my hubby agreed, he wasn't diggin the pizza either. Total (not including tip) was about $40. While the food was just ok the service was great! I'd like to come back & sooner than a few years, because I know I've had good food here in the past. I think next time I need to order some pasta & definitely the pizza cookie! ",0,1,0,0,0

 We arrived last night to LVH where we were greeted by the valet attendant. He flagged down a bell man to help us with our luggage. Then gave us directions to the front desk for check-in. The line to check-in was really long. It took us about 45 mins to check-in. The receptionist was professional. He answered all my questions. He made sure we got one of the updated room since they are still remodeling the Classic rooms. The only bad part was he guided us in the wrong direction to our room. House keeping was working on our floor. So the hallway was full of linens & room service carts. Which seemed odd since it was already 10:30pm. Then again it's a busy place, so maybe they are overwhelmed with work!!! Our room actually looks decent for the price. Compared to the old classic room, it's a big improvement. There are a few issues like the faucet keeps leaking. Some of the furniture is scratched up pretty bad. The bed is comfortable. Overall for the price it's a good deal. Some of the down sides. You have to pay for wifi per night per device. Since, I am paying the resort fees. I get one device connection. Additional devices is $13/night. The bottled water in the room is $4.00/bottle. The coffee is $3.25/cup. What ever happened to complimentary??? On the house??? We usually never have coffee in the room. Most of the times I carry waters & sodas, so it's rare that I drink the water in the rooms. Specially for that price here!!! With all that said, I would still stay here if I can get it for a cheap price. I paid $44.00/night through orbits the weekend before New Years!!! ",0,0,1,0,0

 We went last night.10% of total revenue went to the school and it was PACKED, as expected because Sundance parents/grandparents are the best! Anyway, what was pleasantly surprising was the accommodating service!! We threw away our coupon on the bag for a free cup of ice cream but the server at the counter was willing to give one to us anyway!! We decided on a bigger size but still, she offered! Cleaning off the tables only to have another customer (us) patiently waiting yet still with a positive attitude and not stressed! Made for a wonderful experience for the grandkids PLUS they now like Culvers! (the promotion works Culvers!) It wouldn't have been a first choice to take the kids to, usually won out by McDonald's or BK because they have play areas, but they liked the buttered buns and the ice cream and all the burgers!! We will be back! Hope you decide to do another for Sundance :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 Okay, so I've been to the Carnegie Deli in New York, and it is fantastic. I was staying that the mirage and remembered how awesome the New York location was and decided I had to take my girlfriend there. Wrong Decision. This place was awful in comparison to the New York location. The food was okay, which is not saying much for Carnegie, because the New York location has FANTASTIC food. I'm also a little peeved because in NY, you can get the Blintzes with their fruit toppings, and we couldn't here. That was the first strike, since Blintzes at Carnegie are amazing. I had the Corned Beef Hash and my girlfriend had the Thick Cut Ham and 3 eggs with home fries. I was really expecting a lot out of the hash because they are known for their amazing Pastrami and Corned Beef. Wasn't impressed. It just didn't have a lot of flavor. It wasn't bad flavor, but there wasn't much there to taste. It seemed like the way they cooked it took the flavor out of the corned beef. Maybe I should have gone with the Pastrami Hash, but who knows? Anyways, my girlfriends meal was definitely better than mine, much more on par with the breakfast I expected at Carnegie. The ham was cooked and had a nice caramelization going on. The fried eggs over easy were cooked perfectly, but the home fries just weren't that great. The inside was a little dry and the outside was a little soggy without much flavor. That was probably the most disappointing part for me because I absolutely love good home fries. Next, the service. The service here is bad, especially in comparison to NY. I hate to keep comparing it to NY, but if you are going to use their name, it's gonna happen. In NY, the employees seemed happy, lots of smiles, friendly, and it was like they enjoyed working their. Here, I didn't see a single smile and every employee looked like they wanted to punch someone in the face. Our server asked us what we wanted to eat like 3 times in the first 2 minutes we were there, but we needed a bit to decide, and they didn't return for 20 more minutes. I said a needed a couple minutes, not 20. The kicker, though, was at the end of the meal. In case you couldn't tell from other reviews, the portions are HUGE here. So, I obviously had some of my hash left over (about a third of it) and wanted a box. When I asked for a box, the server asked ""Are you serious?"" and looked at me like I was an idiot. No, I was joking! You caught me! (Sarcasm). In conclusion, don't go to Carnegie unless you are in New York. Walk the extra 20 feet down the hallway and go to BLT Burger, where you will not be disappointed. ",0,1,0,0,0

 What a horrible business with atrocious customer service! I learned of Tiger Lilly at the Las Vegas Bridal Spectacular in August of 2014. The representatives seemed very pleasant and accommodating. Don't they all at the beginning? We scheduled a time for a phone consultation the Wednesday after the show. They never called. A month goes by, and I finally e-mail them to find out what happened. Marina Bradstreet responds, apologizes, and indicates she will give me a quote for my wedding. I provide her *exactly* what I'm looking for - down to the specific design and number of bouquets, boutonnieres, corsages, etc. Two week go by, and I don't hear from her. I e-mail her again asking when to expect the quote as I have other vendors who are waiting on me to make a decision. She replies that it is ""impossible"" to give me the quote because they are in the process of moving offices and she's ""too busy"" with the current wedding season. Impossible? Really? The other florists I contacted had me a quote the same day. You mean to tell me this business doesn't have time to take 5 minutes out of their day to generate a quote? Unbelievable. Needless to say, they lost out on my wedding, and I would recommend others stay faraway. You can find quality florists elsewhere in Las Vegas without the abhorrent customer service. Don't waste your time with Tiger Lilly. P.S I'm willing to forward the e-mails I got from Marina to whoever wants them so you can see how horrid the customer service really is. Just shoot me a message and I'll be glad to send them your way. ",1,0,0,0,0

 After experiencing many of the other ""finer"" steak restaurants in the area it was only inevitable that I try Donovans. I have had a gitt certificate from there for sometime, thus we had a reason to try. It was a Saturday night and the place was pretty busy for the country being in the midst of a recession. My husband and I got there a little before the rest of our party. We sat at the bar that definetly had a cool vibe. I had a decent glass of wine and my husband had an overpriced martini, that he enjoyed. Once the rest of the party arrived (my brother) we were seated. There seem to be some confusion at first to who our waiter was and this set the mood for the rest of the evening. I am a huge fan of Mastro's and Capital Grill, therefore I compare all restaurants to their quailty and service. Donovans just could not meet that burden. Seared Ahi = ehh. It looked as if it had been sitting out for awhile. When I eat ahi i like to look as fresh as it can, obviously. Wedge = My husband orderd the wedge. It was the weakest wegde I have ever seen. Honestly, they should be embarassed. Ribeye = I am not a fan of ribeye, it is too fatty for my taste, however, I hate ordering my own steak because I never finish it so I share with my husband. He is on a ribeye kick at this moment. Anyways, I found it charred, dry, and overly fatty. Peppercorn filet = My brother ordered this filet and seemed to enjoy it. Though he did note that it was definetly not worth the sticker price, Mac and Cheese = AWFUL... go to capital grill you will thank me later! Overall had I not eaten in other steak restuarants maybe Donovan's could fool me. If you are going to spend the money definetly go to Mastros, Capital Grill or even Durants (very cool place)! In the end it was just ehhh and not worth the money! ",0,1,0,0,0

I was expecting a line but we walked right in. So glad we did not have to pay a cover. Although the layout was nice, the decor was cool, the pool was a huge disappointment. It's tiny!

 I love the bar at the Royal Palms, not far off the beaten path, yet in a world unto it's own. You can easily pass the entrance as you cruise down Camelback. Once you turn into the drive way the valet team greets you to park your car. On the way to the bar, stroll through the lovely garden/fountain area - as you step into a more tranquil time. The bar has a number of nooks & cranny's, four cool seating sections - the fireplace room, the tables along the windows bordering the garden, the spacious corner and up at the bar. The entire property has an early Arizona motif which is consistent in the bar with comfy chairs & couches and a wonderful mix of floor tiles. Caitlin, our waitress was welcoming and crisp with her spot on recommendation's. Pork flatbread, was a stand out appetizer with a flavorful consistency of meat, cheese and mushrooms. The Bergstrom Pinot, a real treat, was a nice compliment to our food. This gem of a hideaway was the perfect spot for a light bite and glass of vino on a rainy Monday night. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We have been coming to this establishment since I could remember and we probably come 4 to 5 times a week as individuals either for a drink or food since it's so close to our work. Today on the other hand a group of us fresh off a long days work go in and have a few beers but get greeted with nothing but attitudes and a cold shoulder everytime we ask for a drink. The bartender went as far as saying and I quote ""Can you guys order all at the same time because your inconvenienceing me"". It's not like it was a busy day I understand besides us 8 guys maybe 4 or 5 other people. So we were honestly kinda baffled by what he had said and he responded with if we don't shut up he will kick us out. We honestly were not being rude what so ever but he insisted we leave because as I quote ""this ain't fuckin Applebee's"" and he's probably right because we would have never been treated like this. All in all we were treated as crap when we asked for a beer and were ignored the entire time. So we will not ever come back for a beer or any food ever again and we will let everyone who works with us not to come here also. We will take our asses to Applebee's from now on lol. Ps.

I was very surprised to see all the cool house wares they have here now. Not that I really need another thing in my house. I don't! But, it is fun to look and I have bought a few things anyway. Such as ,I got 2 wonderful sets of crystal glasses for a song. This is real crystal by the way. Not just cut glass. They were quite beautiful. So even though I did not need them. I thought they were well worth the price, they were truly beautiful. There hours are better, they are open longer now than they were when they first opened and that is a plus. The girl working that night took the time to wrap every bit of stemware very carefully. I did really appreciate that as well. You never know what you will find. I love a lot of the furniture they are showing now as well. I just have no where to put it all. But, if you are in the market for some cool home items. I think this is your shop. ",0,0,0,0,1

 i was so pissed. as good travelers, i checked on our 3:55pm flight back to San Jose and it was on time. got picked up and dropped off and checked in by 2pm. therefore, i arrived 2hrs before our flight. sat around for a bit, got a snack and then got to losing $40 in 5mins when we were told our gate has been charged to another gate...B24 to A3. that's a different terminal but OK, here we go. still have about an hr left before our flight so we got our things and walked over there. we sat there for about 20 minutes to be told that our gate has been changed one more time but now back to gate B24. still enough time to get to our old gate and make it to our flight. mind you, during this whole time, no one has told us if there was issues w/ the plane or anything, just that they apologize for the gate changes. we got to our gate, 30mins left and now we are told that our flight is delayed for an additional hr so about 4:55pm until we leave. fine...we sat. and then was told there's some engine issues and we dont know when our flight will be leaving at all. to make it short...4 hrs later...total of 6 hrs at the airport before we board our flight and leave for an hr flight home. they really do everything in their powers not to cancel a flight but then keep all the paid flying customers waiting. I know that's actually the airline's fault about the delay but the service to the customers who have paid and be there at the gate...minimal information was given and hrs after hrs, it's just a waiting game. when i asked if i can get a flight tomororw, no problem but no one will pay for my cab to the hotel or the hotel itself as they are not canceling the flight. this is partial USAirways fault but it is also the airport's fault for not providing the customers with more options when we are stuck there for more than 2 hrs. no real updates until the very end. mind you, it's an hr flight only but I waited for 6hrs to fly for one hr. so frustrating. so glad to be home.

 Good food. The chicken and beef that comes on the stick is actually very good. It's not the cheap junk that you get at most places. Very good texture and flavoring. The shrimp though, not so much. It comes heavily breaded which I am not a fan of at all - although this is well done. I prefer more of a light batter but will just steer clear of this next time. The fried rice is excellent but a little spendy. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Don't worry be happy. The poor waitress seemed so depressed or moody better yet said. I didn't want to ask for anything, I didn't want her to go all psycho ninja on my ass. I didn't receive 1 smile from this lady. The whole time I was there I just wanted to leave. On with the food. I had a Caldo de albondiga, honestly though it tasted like it was from a can. It wasn't all that great. Even I could make this soup better. The cheesy salsa was bomb.com It was a spicy salsa with cheese melted inside. $2.00 for a canned soda because they don't have fountain drinks. Speedy service is a fact at this joint Solicitors are welcome Beer is served cold Overall this place is clean For now this places doesn't meet the standards for Mexican, perhaps Salvadorian. I wouldn't recommend this places at all. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Hey everybody,veggie blogger here! Not sure when the definition of vegetarian meant load up on black beans but Sol practices it. Ordered a grilled veg burrito. Sounded good on the menu since the burrito supposedly should have had onions, peppers, pico de gallo, sauce, and beans. Dissecting my burrito I ended up with an overflow of black beans and onions on the side with nothing else in the middle. To add to that, I had more beans on the plate with some rice. Overall the burrito was cooked right to my liking. The salsa that came with chips was flavourful and spicy. Black beans was cooked just that there was too much of it. I would have liked more veggies than beans. The Don Julio margarita was excellent!! The rice on the side was tasty. Though most of the people on our group didn't enjoy their meal, I think it was good for a one time experience. But I don't think it's a restaurant I would look forward to coming back for a second time. This place in the Scottsdale quarter was average. ",0,0,1,0,0

 all the 4 and 5 star reviews had me excited to give the place a try! Walked in after getting showered and refreshed at the hotel. Glad I had read on a review that there was no sign out side, at least we knew what to look for. Staff was friendly and I really liked the decor and vibe of the place. He was not a fan of the communal seating, especially with the two elderly gentleman and their escorts attempting to carry on conversations. Ordered a round of drinks and ordered the short rib sliders with tater tots and the mac and cheese (which the server proclaimed was ""LIFE CHANGING-you have to have it "". Place was freezing so the wait seemed to be longer than it probably was. a chef and maybe a manager were arguing with the bartender about her ringing an order up incorrectly , fine I get it but really in front of the guests? Sliders looked good, mac and cheese looked good. He grabbed a slider and one bite he was done. The braising in rootbeer is great, but there is NOTHING on the thing to counteract the sweetness. The tater tots were way way overcooked to the point there was no white in the middle. The mac and cheese while decent, was no where near ""life changing"" I spent years in DC if you want life changing mac and cheese go to Cafe Delux in DC. he had been excited to try the bourbon brownie. But instead we left most of the sliders, half the mac and cheese and two half full drinks and went elsewhere for drinks and dessert. ",0,1,0,0,0

 There's no denying that it's a cool place with a very nice decor and ambiance. The kinda trendy place boys and girls go on a Friday night to have a snack and a club experience. Having said that, it's too expensive and presumptuous for my taste. The waiters will be at your beck and call as long as you're ordering one drink after another. There's a $1-7 dinner menu with $25 alcohol consumption at the beginning of the week that's worth the price if you drink 3 cocktails, but only if you get the large and more expensive entrees. Overall the dishes are small, so plan on getting have a second dinner somewhere or getting 2 entrees from the beginning. And yes, it does take them 45 mins. to an hour to serve you some bread, despite asking repeatedly. It's a cool concept with good food, I only wish the price/size ratio was a little more realistic.

 We eat here all the time, the food is always good, however the service depends on who your server is. We have eaten here almost weekly for the buy dinner and get a dinner for tomorrow deal, one time service was great, the second was okay, and the last was horrible. I've never in all the times I have eaten at Olive Garden, had burnt and crispy breadsticks!! It's hard to tell what service will be like until you sit down. Nonetheless, it's quality Italian food for a fair price, if you can deal with the unknowns regarding service. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I've taken things here a few times over the years. It's in a convenient location, the staff is friendly, and the clothing always looks great. My big issue is that the employees stand directly outside and smoke. This looks awful and smells awful- especially when it blows in the front door choking you while you wait in line. I have no idea how they manage to keep the clothing from reeking (or maybe I've just gotten lucky). I could certainly come here more than I do, but I despise walking through a cloud of smoke every time. ",0,0,1,0,0

 The first time that I went to Daily Dose I didn't exactly have a great experience. It took a while to get service and when we did get it, it wasn't great. I'm happy to say that my next visit was the complete opposite! We were seated quickly and the servers and I'm assuming this person was a manager was super nice! I have only tried the appetizers and have been pleased with those. I had the pretzels and the jalapeno chorizo mac n cheese. The pretzels were pretty good. It comes with two tasty dips, but the mac n cheese is to die for! I could eat that dis everyday! I even took a second order home for my husband to try. I ended up eating that one too!

 Stayed here with 3 rooms for a bachelor party. Beds are very comfortable and soft. For the 4 hours of sleep per night it felt amazing. Rooms are ok, standard cheesy Vegas hotel room. Water pressure was great in bathroom. They put us all on the same floor, which was nice. Great location on the strip, but check in and check out process were very slow. you'd think for a hotel with thousands of rooms the front desk would be able to handle the capacity a little better. Also, the Monte Carlo Cafe in the casino is one of the worst restaurants I have eaten at. Overall, not my favorite hotel on the Strip. If you need a average priced room on the Strip in short notice, then it is definitely a great option. If you are planning ahead a couple of months, you can get a better hotel at or about the same price. ",0,1,0,0,0

 had a package deal, dinner at the Sugar Factory and the play Jersey Boys. My son and I were celebrating his birthday. The play was fantastic, however I was disappointed with the restaurant before I was even seated. The hostess was a young women with a tattoo on her back with long straight black hair. She was so inhospitable. No smile ever. We were told the wait was 20-30 minutes and if we wanted to wait. I told her I had no choice because I had a dinner voucher. The Salmon was dry and asparagus over cooked. My son enjoyed his $36 dollar drink. My drink was too sweet though. My waitress was fine. Seemed over worked.

 Jekyll and Hyde is the ONLY place I've drank Innis & Gunn all night, from start to finish, from woe to go, from crack to thump. For those of you who haven't tried Innis & Gunn, it's REALLY potent and tastes so good you just fly through them. This was a problem at Jekyll and Hyde. The night in question wasn't a busy one and there were plenty of staff on, but for some reason service was SLOOOW. Mega slow. I was waiting 5 - 10 minutes in a one-person-deep line. This was not cool, my pal and I were commiserating a dirty break-up and needed alcohol swift and constant, not slow and sporadic. So I started buying two drinks each per line-up, then eventually three each. I don't like to do this because I can't control myself; I drink quick and hard and get too drunk too early. Which is precisely what happened. After a few hours our table was COMPLETELY covered with empty bottles. Completely. When the glass dude came to clear them away he was all like ""Are these all yours?"" and we were like ""(unintelligible sounds)"". And then the guy was like ""Impressive!"" In one passive action, I stopped caring that the service was slow, the tables sticky and the music not to my liking. We had impressed the staff at a heavy-drinking establishment with the amount we had drunk! Bar-cred for us! If you don't mind your bars a little bit sticky and scrappy and with a 'who gives a fuck' attitude, give Jekyll and Hyde a whirl.

 I'm going to a concert in a few days and I wanted a haircut before then. This was very last minute and the place I usually go to was completely booked. I called to see if this place had any openings and they got me a spot within just 30 minutes. Not to mention, they were very patient with me on the phone as I had to put them on hold several times. Erin was very patient and fixed my hair up even though I probably asked her to do something more to it at least five times. I have never been satisfied with a haircut before but finally this time finally did the trick. I loved my haircut. The price was a little more on the high end but it was well worth it for what I got and it looked very similar to the hairstyle in the picture. I would definitely love to go here from now on.

 OMG no I'm not saying Oh My God, OMG is the name of one of their burgers... I didn't have that one and I was glad I didn't because one of the normal sized half pounders did me in just fine thank you very much. I had the Capitaine Flam instead. It was a more traditional cheese, bacon, onion and mayo sort of deal. I had ordered a poutine as well and with so many choices I didn't know where to begin. Seriously if you have trouble decided things in everyday life don't come here. Your brain will blow up in your head trying to decide. I ended up with the smoked meat poutine because hey, we are in Montreal yes? Well technically we are Laval but you get the idea. The food is is something you won't see everyday in just any place. To start things off the menu is in Francais. If you don't speak or read French hope that the people you are with do... I was able to get by just fine but there are some things I just wasn't sure of entirely. Everything is in order of price from lowest to highest so if you venture down to the bottom items yes you will see some outrageous things like the Epic which I don't think I could finish if I was given an entire day to do so. For the ingredients of that particular burger there are some things that to me just do not go together but some that do. For instance bacon and anything just about go but fried Kit Kat? They should rename this burger ""WTF"". Add to that brie, mushrooms oh and 4 x 8oz patties. Apparently from what I could interpret from the menu is said something to the effect that if you finish it you get your picture taken along with a bottle of Pepto Bismal. After something like this you would need a cab ride home too. The photo of the Epic looks like a mountain of food on a plate. I barely could finish my normal burger because my poutine was gynormous. My friend had the Pac Mac which was a burger that had the bun replaced with formed mac and cheese that appeared to be breaded and then deep fried both top and bottom. My other friend ordered a pulled pork that had enough meat fall out to make at least one more sandwich if not two. The drink menu says on the front of the cover ""do not open"" in French. The drink menu is extensive because the bar is like a 10 shelves high. Some of the items on the shelves are like old TV's and other nostalgic items. I went to this place on a TUESDAY and it was packed. I was told on weekends it's crazy. The place looks like a club at best a bar, not a restaurant/bar and the food they serve is something I'd see on TV because everything seemed kind of unreal. The place is kind of noisy inside as it is sort of a bar scene kind of place. The music is loud and most of it was '80s and it was really bringing me back to my youth. This place has to be one of the most unique places to eat I've been in a sense that it's not just a restaurant or just a bar but a real experience sort of what Planet Hollywood was always trying to be and never was if that makes any sort of sense. The food here is just crazy. This is not your typical burger bar... Remember when I said the most expensive stuff was at the bottom? The two bottom poutines were one with foie gras and the other was lobster. Ya this place is not Five Guys thank you very much. Oh ya if you want a shot of Johnny Walker Blue that's on their drink menu too... just a crazy place you would expect to see in the city as they do have one downtown but in this restaurant area in Laval? Cool cool cool. We are so going back to this place next time we are back in Montreal. Literally translated this place means, ""Beauty and the Beef"". ",0,0,0,0,1

 3 strikes your out! It pains me to write this review, my heart actually aches. I wanted to love this place in fact we went back 3 times to give it a shot, I don't normally do that. Sadly we left in heartbreak and will never go back. We have been to Japan, Sushi capital of the world. We are not professionals but have traveled the world. I have respect for those who carry that tradition over to our side of the pond. The owner is amazing his cuts are exactly where they should be the fish are precisely cut the rice is also perfect, he is amazing. So all that going. Great! well not so much. We were treated horribly after our first trip. When we sat at the bar the owner served us the sushi was great. The next 2 times not so much we were pushed off to the sideline. This time was busier we sat at his bar his sidekick took care of us. Sushi is not all about the fish is is about the service, presentation and cut. This individual had none. No service. No presentation. and the cuts were horrible. Fish was slopped all over the place no design or pride it looked like a serial killer left a crime scene. We wanted the owner to wait on us but it seemed he was always busy with his vips. We Will NEVER be back. Treat everyone good and your place will be filled. Treat one person badly and your place will be empty. Three times you're done... ",0,1,0,0,0

 We made the mistake of stopping here on my birthday last year. The inside was packed, as was the outside back bar. So we went to their side bar (which was much more open), they only served Blue Moon, Bud Light, and 3 kinds of Skyy Vodka. Instead of fighting the other crowds, we cut our losses and opened a tab there. Its started to rain, so we went inside to the only open space, the front dining area. When we were ready to leave an hour later, my fiance went to close his tab at the side bar. It was closed. So he went to the back bar and waited another 30 mins for one of the bartenders to get to him. Turns out it was the guy we'd had at the side bar. He asked where he could close his tab since he had opened it at the side bar and that was now closed, the guy said ""At the side bar."" ""But its closed, you served me over there."" ""I DONT HAVE TIME TO HELP YOU."" and he went to the next person at the bar. When my fiance went back inside, obviously pissed, he ran into one of our friends and told him what just happened. One of the bouncers overheard their conversation and asked "" Did you get your card back?"" They do the open tab agreement rather than keep your card. Since my fiance had the bouncer replied "" Then just leave. That guy doesnt deserve a tip anyway."" Robbie Fox's: Rude bartenders, pretentious food, rad bouncers. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Worst. Service. Ever. Some are very nice but inept. Some are terribly rude.

But the beer selection, free peanuts and GREAT popcorn almost make up for it. I visit here nearly weekly with a group. We just have beer, maybe some wings - our needs are pretty minimal, but we have fun joking about how CBI consistently sets new records for poor service. We occasionally get a good server, but they're usually gone by the next visit (come back, Dallas!). It must be a terrible place to work because the staff turnover rate is clearly very high.

 Unfortunately, the district manager has confirmed that this location was shuttered on Sunday, 9/1/13. I had just started going here about three weeks ago and the place was starting to grow on me in a weird sort of way. The first time I went was for the Tuesday $2 for any draft beer day, and that was pretty good except for the short pour beers which I thought maybe was just a fluke and not an everyday occurence. Joined their on line club and went back the following week to redeem the free burger coupon you get upon joining. The server switched my burger with someone elses's and gave us both 1/2 off, so I saved the free burger coupon for next time. The next (and it turns out the last) time I went was 8/29, because I received a coupon for a $5 burger to celebrate the start of the college football season. I should have known it was the ""beginning of the end"" when I walked in about 3:15 pm and nobody was behind the bar, and the North Carolina-South Carolina game that they were hyping for the start of college football season was not on any of the many TV's in the place. After about 5-10 minutes a bartender appeared and I got my usual short pour draft. I presented the $5 coupon and ordered a burger which came out way more done than the medium I ordered. Was too hungry to complain but when the bill came they had applied my free burger credit from the on-line membership that I was saving instead of the $5 coupon I had presented. The manager said he couldn't re-load the free burger credit to my card, so he hand wrote a card ""good for any sandwich or burger"" that I could use on a future visit and commented how instead of getting a $5 burger today, I got a free one and still had a free one coming. Like I said, this place was starting to grow on me because of all of their rather comical screw-ups. The last laugh is on them, however, because I guess I have to go to Peoria if I want to redeem my ""free sandwich or burger"" card. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I was signed up for a year membership and during that year there was one good massage therapist and she left to work somewhere else. After that I tried new therapists each month and after trying 7 different therapists I realized that it wasnt going to get better. Two of the therapists were right out of school and they told me that. I felt bad for them and didnt want to complain but the massages were bad. Then I decided to cancel after and it turns out that you only have one month to use any extra massages you paid for which is tricky. They also make it complicated to quit. I had to speak to manager who wasnt there and then get some form emailed to me and fax it back and follow up to make sure it went through. During my membership there I recall many times customers were really unhappy with the details of their membership and I would watch them argue with the staff. Due to bad quality massage therapists and tricky contracts and bad management personel I wouldnt definately try somewhere else. Good thing it is a competitive market and there are other places that will like to earn your business. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Primanti Brothers is pronounced like this - Prih - MAN - Tee. It is not Prih - Mahn - Tee. People from Pittsburgh will take this error very seriously. So, onto the food. The famous Primanti Brothers roast beef sandwich is a very regular sandwich with some soft fries and OK coleslaw in it. The size of the sandwich is ""above average"" but it is not the gargantuan monster that I was hoping to see. The roast beef is fine but it really isn't anything to write home about. Primanti Brothers suffers from ""Philly Cheesesteak Syndrome"" - It is a food item that has come to represent a city's food scene and really just for tourists. It is fine food at a reasonable price but there are a hundred other, superior options. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I was in and out for a specific item so I didn't really get to check out inventory or full layout but the guy that helped me was really cool and they had what I wanted. ATTENTION: temporarily not accepting credit cards. I asked the employee about this and he said it is due to banks holding funds from gun stores. Hope all the ban talk and craziness goes away soon.

 First off, the service was very good. My husband went here a few times because he had some problems with his cell phone. He had a blackberry curve but his contract was up and he was interested in getting a new phone, an upgrade, (although he liked his old blackberry but disliked the little ball- gets dirty and needs replacing), so when he got one (free with 2 yr. activation), he was glad at first. Then it wasn't working properly (could not hear him speaking on the other end) after about 2 weeks. So he came back here, to see what could be done. He went to the one on Russell/Pecos, where he got a replacement (which turned out to be a refurbished one; which he did not know until he got it). Well, since he had already agreed to a new contract, the people assisting him, kept this phone for observation, and reset it a few times. Guess what? It still was not working the right way (the ringer was not working, so he could not receive calls), so he was stuck. Although the service was nice, and the people were nice about it, they were unable to keep him as a customer. So, the service was good, but the product was not up to par (and because this was a family plan, his payment would jump up significantly; some bs data upcharge of $10/mo). ",0,0,1,0,0

 The Dane may have great beer and a good atmosphere, but the food is borderline inedible. The menu is far too large, first of all. They have burgers...and hummus. They serve Italian ""specialties""...and beer and cheese soup. No restaurant can pull this off and pull it off well. During the Badgers game yesterday, we ordered chicken nachos. I think that the chicken must have run through the nachos, because I couldn't detect a single piece of chicken in the mix. The nachos were not good. We also ordered hummus. Three of us ate roughly 10% of the platter, it was that bad. The waitress made no effort to ask us how things were--and it was not a busy time. Service is generally okay, but wasn't yesterday at all. Drinks and beer are fine here, but if you want to eat, go elsewhere. ",0,1,0,0,0

 My mother-in-law was in town, so we decided to go get mani/ pedis. I found this place and thought the reviews were pretty decent and decided to give them a try. First, they were very friendly and gave us both great pedicures. We both got the deluxe (mid-range) one and they did a great job. But that's where the fun ended. I got a regular manicure, which went fine until I got outside and realized how horrible the paint job was! She gave me 2 coats, but the second only covered about 60% of my nail and you can clearly see the layers. She also shredded my cuticles (it wasn't painful, just didn't clean them up after trimming them). I had to fix them myself when I went home. Save yourself the money and paint your nails at home. But, if you're looking for a good pedicure, I would definitely recommend them! ",0,0,1,0,0

 This is Charlotte's best kept secret!!! The food is absolutly delicious. With a huge menu (almost to big lol) the Cooks really have a great personal touch.. my gf and I went in to eat and she asked the server for dinner not on the menu. Not only did they go above and beyond with the customer satisfaction but mellow mood of a nice hang out cozy bar ""like back home"" def made me want to come back. We also had a few drinks and the Bartender actually made us a couple shots. Although the name of the shot is a little out there I will be back to try another ""Duck Fart"" for sure lol. The best part is the bar also owns Palones the pizza restaraunt next door. I see myself with a few buddies having a few beers and eating pizza while watching March madness basketball very soon......!!!!! I recommend this place to EVERYONE... even if you have kids there is mulitple games and a pool table to play. They even have a 100inch screen that hooks up with a Wii for fun bar games and entertainment!!! ",0,0,0,0,1

 The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because I do like the food at Panera in general. This location and the customer service are terrible here, to the point where I won't even bother going anymore. I work in the area and have given way more chances than I should have for them to try to redeem themselves. The staff seems as though they have no training in customer service, I even called one day to complain to a manager because I was apparently interrupting a conversation between a cashier and a customer who already paid. The customer even said, ""Oh, I'm sorry. You can take care of her"". The cashier proceeded to say ""It's ok, she can wait"". Are you kidding me?! That was a first at any restaurant I'd ever been to. Another time I went in during the evening, the place was basically empty. The cashier asked if she could take my order, I told one minute I was deciding. She walked into the back and didn't come back, I waited for someone to come help me which they didn't so I left. I don't have too much to say about the parking lot because I would walk there but I know it's hard to get in and get out. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Pretty cool alternative to those of us who don't booze it up in Vegas. We did the sample coca colas from around the world. 2 trays, 14 different sodas for $7. Not bad. We had a few favorites such as the Mango Kiwi, the Watermelon and an Apple flavored one. Be aware that not all of them taste good. The Beverly tasted like socks. You have been warned! Overall, it was a good experience for someone who likes Pepsi over Coke. ",0,0,0,1,0

 A buddy and I went Lemongrass for lunch today. Now I have to admit I have drove by this place for the past 2 years since my office is right down the street. As I pulled up I figured this only has two options being great or making me feel like I need to take the afternoon off.... I don't know why I was surprised, other yelpers have said the same thing and I agree. This place is good. This is one of the better hole in the wall places I have been to in a while. I had the salad with Lemongrass Basil Chicken as my entr \ u00e9e and was very pleased. Now I did go with the spicy level 2 out of 3 but this isn't a true Thai scale in my mind. Next time I think I will go with the level 3. If you are looking for a fresh, filling and authentic Thai meal for a reasonable price in Tempe make your way over to Lemongrass. ",0,0,0,1,0

Our appetizer came after we finished our meal and when we asked for more bread earlier the waiter joked about how there is a one loaf per table rule.

 It isn't anything spectacular but it isn't terrible either. Sometimes the food is a little extra crispy and sometimes it is just right. I would give it 4 stars but really must give it 3 because it isn't consistent every time and certain things have been questionable. I will say this though, IHOP is right across the street but I would defiantly choose this place over them any day. That still doesn't say a whole lot about this place. I usually order waffles. If it isn't overcooked it is very tasty. I tried the chicken and waffles once but the chicken just seems like a frozen chicken finger they nuked and put on top. The eggs are usually the only thing cooked perfect and they do taste good. I have asked for sides before such as extra ranch or mayo and gotten weird extras in the cup it was brought in. Basically, this place isn't bad every once in a while but to take family and friends I would go t Rachel's Kitchen or up to Bagel Cafe. I get a coupon every now and then in the mail and that is when I generally eat there. ",0,0,1,0,0

 We came here post-show to get something to eat/drink. I'd looked at the menu and it looked reasonable so we made an Open Table reservation and headed over. The menu was not up to date online and unfortunately wasn't as cheap as I'd seen. My biggest complaint is a) this isn't a real gastropub and b) the beer list is laughable. Horrible. Terrible. They make it sound like it's this really expansive and amazing beer list. What is it really? It's basically the swill of every western country. Coors, Bud, Stella, Guinness (Guinness isn't swill, I'll admit that), PBR. Oh, and those swill beers? Yeah, the PBR was $9. It's so absurd it's almost funny. We were going to wait 20 minutes for happy hour to start, so at least the beers would be half off, but when our waitress came over she explained that they had a New Belgium seasonal for $3/pint. I don't understand how they can sell PBR for $9 and an actually drinkable beer for $3, but whatever. For food we got some salads and sliders. My greek salad was a big portion and good, and we also got some fried pickles to share. The majority of our pickles were bread and butter, which I don't think works very well in a fried pickle, but they came with several sauces and were pretty good. At this time our server got super overwhelmed and sort of ignored us for 15 minutes at a time, but the bussers were very nice and even asked if I didn't like my food, because I only ate about half of it out of fullness. It wasn't bad for a somewhat affordable after-show option, but honestly I'd avoid it in the future. It acts like something it's not and man, that beer list. I don't normally call myself a beer snob, but I'll happily wear my beer snob hat for the rest of eternity if it means I don't have to see that sad a beer list again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Now I know why, no matter what day of the week it is, there is a good crowd of people at/in this place. While it's one of our neighborhood joints, it took our good friends who live miles away raving about it for us to try it. I'm a gelato fan, and hubby likes good quality ice cream - but Yogurtology did not disappoint! The place is well lit, and spotless, which says a great deal when you are talking a self-serve frozen yogurt shop with several flavors of frozen yogurt, a bottom station where there are various choices to put in before the yogurt, and then a HUGE variety of toppings. You can imagine how messy all of that could get, but not here. Staff was cheery and friendly and not all stained up with the product (like other popular places that serve ice cream). There were 4 of us, and we all sampled a few different flavors each. My choice was the cupcake batter - YUM. Not too sweet and a great base for my topping choices of strawberries, bobas (little gelatin-like balls of flavor), raspberry sauce and Oreo cookie crumbles. The only thing I was disappointed with was the foundation oatmeal creme filled cookie, which was so hard it nearly broke my spoon. I thought it got hard from the frozen yogurt, so waited a few minutes to try it, but it was still really hard, so I tossed it. Hubby had salted caramel, cupcake batter, and red velvet cake, no toppings. Very good combo, salted caramel was a little too sweet for me. My girlfriend had pomegranate, which was very good and reminded me of an Italian ice. It was very refreshing. I'm sure we will be back! With or without our friends. Watch those toppings, as they definitely add weight, and you are paying per oz. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The Cheesecake Factory is definitely on my list of favorites....Ive never been to this location before and I was in the area so I decided to give it a try. The service was great, our waiter was very attentive, and the food was pretty good although my shrimp was a bit over cooked (I had the shrimp and chicken gumbo)...one thing that really bothered me was how filthy their silverware was (there was pieces of leftover food on my spoon and butter knife).

 Bramble is one of these places you can feel quite smug about taking visitors to, as it's the kind of bar you need to have inside knowledge about, location wise anyway. Away from the main strip of bars on George Street and Hanover Street, and residing subtly at basement level just off Queen Street, Bramble mixes up classy, stylish and funky in a cocktail infused, DJ accompanied atmosphere. The bar area is small, with sultry lighting and little pockets of cosy, cave-esque seating and big armchairs, where you can lounge with friends or with whoever you please. This is certainly an ""intimate"" setting, although something about that word makes we want to laugh immaturely, as it just sounds far too grown up. Let me put it a better way, if you've lived in Edinburgh for a lot of your life, and you're fed up with the nosey, gossiping eyes of people you know peering to see how your date's going, then I would recommend Bramble as a safe house to hide away in. Aside from just being a very cool little bar, the main reason to seek out Bramble is the fantastic selection of cocktails on the menu. Always a sucker for pretty presentation, I favour the cocktails that come in a tea cup and saucer, but all of the cocktails on the menu look amazing, and the bar staff go to pains to make sure everything is mixed up correctly. The bar gets pretty busy at the weekends, so get your cocktail orders in early if you're banking on a seat all evening. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I really wanted to like this location. I mean I REALLLLYYYY wanted to like this spot. I grew up near Beach Hut in northern Cali and it quickly was one of my favorite lunch spots of all time. I was stoked when I moved to NV and saw that they had a Beach Hut, it was one of the first places I had to go eat. Upon arriving, I gave my order to a worker that I'm not sure knew where he was. There are certain things I like on a sandwich and certain things I don't, usually it's not complicated and this was no exception. Somehow just ordering turned into an approx 10 min ordeal. I wish I could explain how it took so long to just go through what I wanted and what I didn't, but unfortunately I went through the process of repeating it twice (very slowly) and he still seemed confused. The sandwich came out after another 10 min wait and was awesome, the food here I truly can't knock, it really is good. The next time going here was fairly uneventful luckily (which truly should be expected at anywhere I go). There was a longer than normal wait considering my order was the only one they were making, but the food made up for it. My next trip here really bothered me to the point that I don't wish to go back. I want to say, I DON'T mind waiting if the food is worth it, I may get a little annoyed considering there's typically no cooking for a sandwich, but I'll deal with it and be happy. So upon walking in, I head right to the counter and give my order for a To-Go order. Based on my previous experiences with Beach Hut in general, I know it'll take 5-10 minutes at least. After being outside for maybe a minute or two tops, a young girl calls my name and tells me that my order is ready, which I found out. I asked if she was sure it was mine which she tells me ""yes"", I repeat back what I ordered just to make sure because this seemed unusually quick. She again tells me that it's mine while looking slightly annoyed. Unfortunately I feel like somehow it's my fault for not trusting my gut instinct and actually opening up the sandwich and checking to make sure it was right. So fast forward to 15-20 drive home and opening up ""my"" sandwich... well... i think you can guess that it wasn't mine. If it was just a minor screw up like the same # but with/without onions I would be ok with it, but unfortunately this was just completely a different sandwich. I don't prefer to have mustard and this thing was loaded up. Normally I'd chalk it up to just a normal error like when Fast Food happens to toss the wrong item on your burger, but this just doesn't have the same feel to it. If there was more people inside ordering at the time I could understand just tossing the wrong sandwich in the wrong bag, unfortunately there was only 1 other person ordering and that was after me. Best guess is they screwed up someone's sandwich and found a quick way to get rid of it. I'm sure in the future I'll break down and give this place another shot based on my love affairs with the ones from my home town, but I just don't see it happening anytime soon. It's been 3 months since my last time here and I don't know when I'll try it again. The food really is great and based on that alone I want to rate this 5 stars, just the employees/service bring this one down so badly to the point I feel 1.5/2 stars is appropriate. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Since I went to New York and failed at going to the original location I was excited to see that there was one in Vegas. I have come here a few times, and each time ordering something different to indulge my sweet tooth. The decor is cute, but the location is too small, always a long wait, so be prepared. Luckily where it is located there is plenty of seating while you wait. They also have a walk up window for those of you who just want to satisfy your frozen chocolate cravings and not have to wait too long. Whenever I come I am usually with a large group and we usually all order a different item. We mainly come for the desserts and not food, so I honestly can't rate that part, even though everything does look delish. From what I have seen the portions are large, enough for sharing, which I would recommend. That way you have room for dessert, which is the main attraction here. ",0,0,0,1,0

 i usually do not eat japanese food in vegas just because you could basically find good basically anywhere in california. But my friend insisted we eat here because sushi should be pretty quick but man were we wrong. We waited well over 45 minutes to get one sushi roll, salmon sashimi rice and sashimi. How long does it take to make food that require no cooking besides the rice? The sushi came out and was smaller than a average vietnamese spring roll and my god it tasted horrible. First off this place is supposed to be a high end ""asian restaurant"". The sushi was worse than those pre made plate you could buy at safeway or costco. The service was not all that great as well. This place has to be hands down one of the worst places to eat sushi that i have tried within the last ten plus years. Very disappointed in the overall experience. To top that off we had to pay basically 100 bucks for a crappy tasting roll and a few pieces of sashimi. I would advice anyone who loves sushi not do dine here. Long waits and crappy food complemented with crappy service. They need to focus less on decor and invest more money on the kitchen staff or new head chef. ",1,0,0,0,0

 My bestie and her BF were in town and wanted to head on over here as they've heard nothing but good about it. I never really seek out buffets, but when tourist come I will oblige and indulge. Just a note that a few of the pictures show a price list when it first opened and it is NOT accurate. The profile picture is a outdated price list. This is the cost (currently) as follows: Breakfast (Mon - Fri, 7 a.m. - 11 a.m.): $25.99 Brunch (Sat - Sun, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $40.99 Lunch (Mon - Fri, 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $32.99 Dinner (3 p.m. - 10 p.m.): $45.99 on weekdays, $50.99 on weekends One thing about this place is that it is sleek and modern and was very well designed and the music selection contemporary downtempo type stuff. Of course we came for the food and the buffet was nicely spread out and nothing was looking old and dried out. We came around 4ish on a monday so it wasn't busy and had no line. That sometimes is a cause for concern that they wouldn't rotate out the lunch out fast enough, but everything was fresh by that time. I wouldn't want to wait hours in a line to eat either and would probably greatly change my opinion of this place. I rarely think anything is worth standing around 1-2 hours so I will go before rush times. I got a little bit from various savory stations among several rounds and nothing was bad. Even at some other higher end buffets I've had some misses I did not eat which did not occur here. Most ranged from good to very good with only two OK items (fried chicken could be juicier but had good breading, ceviche a little too lime and not enough salt). I was most surprised that the oysters were sweet and not strongly briny, mussels and snow crab were good. The meat station was solid - the veal steamship was juicy and fall apart tender, the lamb chops were perfectly cooked and good quality and the skirt steak was really tender which I'm normally not a fan of as it can be stringy. The baked salmon was surprisingly not overcooked and was perfect, The handmade dim sum were rather nice as I went back for seconds on their pork and leek dumpling. Dessert wise they were also strong. I really enjoyed the panna cotta with berry, the creme brulee was great texture (though the top could have been torched more), their warm pizookie type cookie was awesome with a scoop of ice cream and fresh whipped cream. They had french macarons, which is my favorite, and theirs was surprisingly decent! I loved the orange with chocolate creme macaron out of the 5 flavors they had and overdid it with inhaling these. Service was great. He was on top of drinks, but was also friendly and engaging conversation. My bestie really enjoyed the variety and definitely thought it was worth it and gives it a 4 while she giggles about my funny hobby. Her BF is a bit of a picky eater and doesn't eat some of the higher ticket items like the seafood bar to have made it worth the high pricetag of what he got, though he thought it was good. I can see why this buffet gets rave reviews. It is quantity that is serving up some quality too. I don't know if it's ""good value"" enough for me to return on my own, but I'm sure I'll be back at some point with tourist friends. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I'd been to Settebello once before and finally made it back last night with my husband and another couple, and we all really enjoyed our meals. The service was great, and I love the Italian decor. They don't take reservations on the weekend, but we had no problem getting a table. Here's the food breakdown: Caprese salad - awesome! They really know what they're doing with this salad. We ordered it at another pizzeria in town last weekend and it was just so-so. Settebello really got it right. Mmm. Diavola Pizza - We shared this since we were getting dessert, too. This was really good. It has a bit of a kick to it, but not too bad. I love the fresh mozzarella, and the crust is so chewy and good! Nutella Pizza - This was a big reason why I'd been wanting to go back. We saw it on the menu last time we went but exercised some self control, and I've been thinking about it ever since! It has an awesome presentation and just looks delicious, and it tasted delicious, too! Our friends got the La Bomba (caramel surrounded by peanut butter gelato coated in chocolate), which was also delicious. We will definitely be back! ",0,0,0,0,1

 For many years my husband and I lived in San Francisco where a favorite restaurant quickly became a faithful friend or a country one likes to visit again and again. Once we resettled in Madison, we regularly frequented the Caf \ u00e9 Continental on King Street because it reminded us of the great restaurants we had formerly enjoyed and also because of its unique style. Besides its first-rate menu, the theatrical decor, with its Renaissance colors, and the engaging drama of the place, with its subtle lighting and joyful sounds, kept us, and many others, coming back. Now relocated to Fitchburg, the Veranda carries on the tradition of the Caf \ u00e9 Continental and the high culinary values of the Schiavo family. Brunch on the weekend is when we typically have chosen to come. The Veranda benedict, boasting the best ingredients, features asparagus and prosciutto or beef tenderloin and Bavaria smoked bacon with an addictive Hollandaise sauce. Included with the order is Rose Marie's recipe for a warm, creamy potato side dish. The Benedicts alone are worth the trek to the suburbs. Alternate selections include a similar array of omelettes, French toast or pancakes. Also on the menu is a rich array of fresh oysters as well as mussels and clams--devilishly good in a Chablis and garlic butter sauce. Specialty items include Rose Marie's original spiedini, besides other selections we have yet to try. Then there are the many freshly made pasta dishes (the pappardelle pasta with shrimp and wild-caught scallops bathed in a buttery cream sauce is splendid), sandwiches-my favorite is the grilled chili-ginger marinated tilapia and my husband's the curry chicken with dried cranberries and romaine lettuce served on a toasted ciabatta) and then the salads (an old reliable for me is the Veranda Caesar salad with grilled chicken, shaved cheese and croutons. Irresistible on a cold day (a hot one as well!) is the mushroom soup which is velvety and delicious, the slices of bread accompanying it, and other dishes, are marvelously fresh and warm. The deserts are original and appealing. Famed Babcock Hall espresso ice cream with little chunks of truffle based on a Veranda-inspired formula anyone?. A taste of the afterlife, to be sure! The outdoor "" verandah,"" with its bower of shadowing trees, hanging baskets bursting with red flowers and fluttering canopy umbrellas, seems ideal for a home-made lemonade or any one of a number of stronger spirits from behind the fully-stocked (nifty zinc counter) bar. Savor a glass of fine cabernet or pinot grigio from the luxury of options on the bar's wine list. On a late afternoon, add to this an appetizer of caponata bruschetta or fried calamari with a lemon garlic aioli. Many of the loved recipes which were appreciated by the hundreds of patrons who made the Caf \ u00e9 Continental their restaurant of choice have returned. Abundant portions of the best in quality of pasta, steak, seafood and greens are proudly served. The interior of the restaurant is warm, embracing and truly ""continental"", a honeycomb arrangement of rooms perfect for special events. One feels special, a part of the family, greeted the moment one arrives by the hostess, who brightens the experience, then offers a comfortable booth or table. Staff are friendly and engaging. The premises are immaculately clean. Once you begin going out to the Veranda, the distance seems not so far and this fine ultimate destination actually seems very near. Carole M. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Great neighborhood sushi place! Close to home, excellent vibe and atmosphere - easy going and never too hectic. Great service, and the sushi ranges from excellent to good (I think it is tough to get fresh fish every night in Arizona - so, some times, some of the sushi isn't as fresh as others). Check the website for their happy hour and 'two for' specials - always helps to feed the heartier appetites! ",0,0,0,1,0

 When you think of Las Vegas, you think of bigger and over-the-top, but prepare yourself for disappointment upon entering the Hooters Restaurant in the Hooters Casino. To put it best: it's an ordinary Hooters restaurant that happens to be in Vegas, as opposed to being the ""Vegas Hooters."" Expect your typical Hooters experience but in a drearier setting because the Hooters Casino is a bit dingy, and with so many other places to visit for cheap greasy food this place is usually very quiet. In my opinion, Hooters should consider putting more money into the location and making it a Vegas destination. There are other places with better looking waitresses and cheap food/drinks, so why limit one's self to this hole in the wall location? In Vegas, there are too many options for attractive waitresses to be stuck at this place - that's the feeling that I got during my visits. There is nothing wrong with the place and it is your typical Hooters experience, but shouldn't the expectations be higher in Vegas? I have been to several Hooters restaurants throughout California, and have been to the Vegas location 3-4 times. I actually stayed at the hotel on one occasion during a last minute Vegas trip when my usual places were booked, so I have a thorough perspective of the hotel, bar, casino, and restaurant. The Vegas Hooters isn't bad but it really can't compete with the other Vegas options. The casino and bar area is sad and depressing, but the rooms are super cheap and better than the local roach motels. I'm a guy that likes wings, beers, and stealing glances at the waitresses, but in Vegas, there are so many nicer places for the same cost, that I can't really recommend the restaurant unless you've never been to a Hooters restaurant before. It's not bad, but there is no energy and the vibe is nonexistent. This location is average when compared to other Hooters locations, but less than average when compared to other options in the area.

 Well we went with intentions on belting out some great tunes while drinking some great drinks. Unfortubately, the catalogue is dated, and the bar is smoky as all hell (expected). However, after giving the DJ a nice tip & song request our turn NEVER happened. The same people were called up on stage drunk out of their minds (to be expected) to sing; were talking 4-5 times.. Kind of made us wonder, why weren't we called? Hmmm... Nevertheless, we won't go back, were still looking for a great Karaoke bar that will allow us the opportunity to have a great time. ",0,1,0,0,0

 SCAM!!!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!! my car was in vegas, i was out of town. my car needed work done prior to when i got back in town, i spoke to a man named anthony who assured me that he could take my credit card payment over the phone and have it all done in no time.... the car was brought there by a friend, and when he got there, they told him there was no one by the name anthony that works there. as soon as my friend told me that, i called, and ""anthony"" picked up the phone and said to come back in. so we set it up for 2 days later... 2 days later comes and i call to make sure ""anthony"" is there . once again the man on the phone tells me, ""no one works here with that name"" my theory is that ""anthony"" gave a fake name, in hopes of stealing my credit card information.

 Bad service and the dim sum wasn't that great either! As everyone knows, you don't go to a Chinese Restaurant for the service -- it's all about the food or in this case the Dum Sum. We came here on our visit to Las Vegas and decided to take a gamble on this place. Unfortunately, the house won the bet and we lost. Let's talk about service, or the lack of service. Every time we requested something from the waiter/waitress, we had to ask two or three times. ""Miss, can we have some water?"" ""Excuse me, can we have some water?"" ""Hello? We asked for some water earlier -- can we have some water?"" Maybe they didn't want us to get full from drinking, but I sounded like a broken record. When we finally got the water, the waitress didn't apologize or seem sorry that her service sucked! On to the food --- this was some gross Dim Sum. The har-gow was blah - the chow fun was stick and nasty - the fried rice tasted like crap. Nothing good here! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Went on a date here with my boyfriend after finding a Groupon for this restaurant. We ordered Chicken Pad Thai and roast duck with vegetables. The pad thai was not very good. The roast duck was decent, but when I ordered a side of rice it was over priced and the portion was very small. In fact, all of the portions were small and overpriced, including the VERY SMALL and expensive spring rolls. My boyfriend ordered a coke and it was very expensive and did not get free refills. Would NOT return to this place again. Especially if i had to pay full price for it. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I've been to the Peppermill a few times, both the lounge and the diner sides. This last time was just bad. Initially we wanted to sit in the Lounge by the fire pit, but after 15 minutes of sitting at a dirty table and getting no service we had to get up and ask someone for menus. When we received the menus we decided to go to the diner side as there couldn't have been more than 10 choices that you are able to order in the lounge side. Okay, fine. We get to the diner side, the guy who seats us is a complete...I had to ask him to seat us! We table hopped to finally find one that wasn't a) by a bunch of loud obnoxious drunk kids or b) underneath a full blast AC going in October. After finding a table getting a waiter was our next struggle. A man walked by and asked if we had ordered, we said no and he just walked off. We were pretty confused as I thought no was a pretty universal word. When we finally got him to come back we waited quite a while for the less than mediocre food we were served (again, I ordered a burger). I get that this is a cool place to go if you're absolutely trashed and hungry in Vegas late at night, but NEVER EVER go here sober. Trust me, the food and the irritation isn't worth it. Ugh.

 Took my family here for dinner on a Tuesday. Chose this place over Buffalo Wild Wings. BIG MISTAKE. Food was horrible! Tuesday's they have .35 cent wings ( didn't know this until we say down and looked at the menu ) but the wings were super greasy, small, no meat, and tasted very bland. I hate restaurants that promote specials like its a deal and all the do is take away from the quality. Very disappointed and will never go here again. Should have stuck with what I know best, Buffalo Wild Wings! ",0,1,0,0,0

 While the staff here was friendly, I don't think I'll be returning my dog here anytime soon. He came home with some dried blood in the crevices on his face, and while I know he can be obnoxious and that he probably brought an injury upon himself, an explanation from the staff when we picked him up would've made a difference in how we felt about the situation. However, instead we brought him home and then later found the scabs. I don't like that you can't see the dogs in the play area, and when you walk in it almost sounds like they're all just locked up when I believe they say that all day play is included. A few other things happened but they were pretty minor and could've just been a miscommunication on my part. Overall, I think the employees care a lot about the dogs and I don't fault them at all, but I do feel that management is trying to cut corners or refrain from telling the whole story and I can't say that I would trust them again. Very nice facility, though! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Cutting edge Italian food presented beautifully in the perfect contemporary setting of the Cosmo. Scarpetta's food is about building and layering flavors from a few ingredients to produce a harmonious dish. For starters, raw is best. The tuna ""scusci"" is excellent. The tartness of the marinated veg pairs perfectly with the fish. The raw yellowtail dish, with its pure simplicity brings out all the subtle sweetness of the fish. Finally the wagyu tartare. Wow, the use of the hazelnuts and Parmigianino cheese creates a totally unexpected flavor! For pasta, its gotta be the duck and foie gras ravioli. Other yelpers said they loved it. It really is good. The pasta is perfectly cooked and works well with the sweetness of the marsala reduction. Top mains include the branzino with pine nuts and green garlic gremolata that totally brings out the naturally nutty flavor of the fish and the pancetta wrapped veal loin, served with sweetbreads. The flavors are very subtle and absolutely delicious. The wine list is very good with a nice balance of Italian wines (not just super Tuscans). Vintage depth is OK. Prices are in line with Vegas resorts. Service is very efficient. Overall prices are very good for a restaurant of this caliber. Recommended. ",0,0,0,0,1

 We only go to One World when we're too intoxicated to realize that well, we're at One World. My roommates and I would usually wake up in the morning with a couple plain white cardboard boxes on our living room table with nothing left but grease stains in them. Seems like the $5 dollar pizzas win us over after a long night on Green St. I have had One World sober. Maybe if I was drunk, it would have tasted better. Not exactly quality ingredients and the bread tastes a little like the white cardboard box it comes in. Open basically until the sun rises, it does it's job of satisfying late night hunger. Personally, I'd opt for passing out instead. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I cannot say enough good things about this business. First and foremost, it appears to be very clean and the people who work her are very nice and professional. Now, onto the review of the actual services. I've been here probably five times for pedicures and it is by far the best treatment for your money. A standard pedicure is $25 and that includes polish removal, nail clean up and shaping, salt scrub, leg and foot massage, hot stone rub, hot towels, and polish. Where else can you get all of that in a clean, professional setting for $25? Even better, I have never been rushed! Most of my pedicures here have lasted almost an hour. Highly recommend! ",0,0,0,0,1

 We've eaten at multiple roy's locations throughout the U.S. And although the Maui location stands out, this one is still one of the better locations. My significant other loves this place and always gets the butterfish, I've tried a variety of dishes with fixed reviews, the salmon is one of the best I think. I have to admit that when we come here and it's slow, your Roy's experience is much better than say on valentine's day or close to it. Still this place is pricey, most of time it's worth the cost but on some occasions not so much. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Very clean. The people working there used to be more helpful. They usually can get you in quickly. We had mostly been happy with them. They also do boarding and grooming. We have been using them for 3.5 yrs but considering switching. Here's why: You can no longer get an appt with Dr John anymore, nor can you talk with him. The other drs I do not trust their opinion...one guy was such an airhead he took my dog's blood pressure, forgot to write it down, then when we were paying and leaving, he detained us to redo it. Dr Cesar? I think his name was. We got a lady one time, she seemed ok but not as personable as Dr John. All of them have a different opinion of what dog food you should be using. I mean, HUGE difference. I called a week ago, trying to get a surgery taken care of we had put off due to finances...I asked what the procedure is to get it done now since the price quoted me was more than 1 yr ago when we couldn't afford it; do we have to have a consult or something? The girl didnt know. She put me in hold, then told me to come consult with (not the surgeon but another vet)...and when I asked; why would I consult with NOT the surgeon, and was that going to cost extra, she told me not to yell at her. Honey, you have not heard me yell. That was condescension for your not knowing good customer svc skills or how to do your job, not yelling. Anyway, she assured me she would talk with Dr John about it and get back to me ASAP. Not sure when ASAP is, but we are a week out now. SOOO I guess I will check with another vet about this needed surgery. This originally was 5 stars until lately, with the not-the-best service. I am thinking it probably should be even lower stars, but Dr John did do a good job on the first surgery and even offered to float me a loan paid back when I could, but monthly, just out of his concern for the dog, but at the time I was overwhelmed with bills and didn't want to add one more huge one to the pile. BUT since he is not really available to even talk to, new ppl may not even get this good kind of caring cust svc here anymore. Sad that it has gone this downhill. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Courteous cashier got me the best deal on my purchase (chicken gyro combo as opposed to a more expensive separate chicken gyro and small greek salad). Chicken gyro was a great blend of thick sliced chicken, cucumber mayo dressing, onions, and tomatoes all on a soft warm pita. Greek salad had all the expected toppings: feta, tomatoes, onions, pepperchinis, onions and a vinaigrette. For being a rather fast order, food was delicious. Order was around 10 dollars. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I had a Groupon for Charr so my husband and I decided to go there for date night. I loved Aiello's when it was open and I like the Salumeria they have next door. Charr was decent but not overwhelmingly good. The atmosphere is nice... I like the decor. Most of the servers are attractive young males. I had a Moscow Mule which was refreshing and potent. I thought the drinks, including the beer were overpriced. My husband ordered the Charr burger, cooked medium rare. He said it came medium well. He still thought the beef tasted good though. I ordered the roasted veggie sandwich. It was okay. The aioli that came on it was delicious. The bun that both my sandwich and my husband's burger came on was good and I liked the idea but it came apart on both of us. The fries were thin and crispy and yummy but our server only brought out one serving for us to share. I noticed other tables of two each had their own serving... hmmmm. Luckily we were more than full despite sharing one serving of fries. Service was good except for when my husband had to flag someone down for some mayo after getting our food. It took a solid 5 minutes. Our total bill before the Groupon discount for 2 burgers, fries, and 2 alcoholic beverages was around $45. A little overpriced for a burger date night. We will return for happy hour. The drinks were tasty and I am eager to try some of their appetizers. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Strolling around uptown, I came across Aria at street level of the Bank of America building. Through the windows I could see an inviting bar area so I decided to choose Aria for my dinner. I was greeted warmly by the hostess and then found a seat at the bar. The bartenders were quick to speak with me and offer me a beverage. I ordered the shaved kale salad and definitely recommend it. In addition to the kale, there were shaved Brussels sprouts and chopped hazelnuts. The salad was finished off with a hazelnut vinaigrette. Really nice. My main course was the carbonara pancetta - the pasta was done perfectly and the sauce had just the right consistency - not too heavy.

 I have very mixed feelings about the Mirage. Some things were great, others just OK, while some things sucked ass. First the good: The renovated rooms are very nice. Flat screen TV's plus all kinds of ports for computers, video games, and an Ipod dock. Lots of granite , very comfortable chairs, all around a tasteful, comfortable room. Also the air-conditioning was quiet and very cool. The only complaints about the room were the cheap plastic toilet seat that wouldn't fucking stay up when I was urinating, and the shower/tub combo seemed claustrophobic and I couldn't help but get the entire floor wet when bathing. The buffet was also very good, and laid out well, no bottlenecks of people standing holding their plates impatiently waiting for food (hear me Paris?) The asian items were my favorite along with huge cold crab legs. Japonais restaurant was excellent. Though expensive, the service was amazing and every single item was yummy. I did have good luck in the casino on the slots, despite Mirage's reputation for having a tight casino. I played ALIEN slots and won like $150 in a matter of seconds when I hit a bonus round and blew the alien out of the airlock. I screamed out loud I was so happy. I never ever win anything. That made my fucking day!! Now for what was bad: Caribe Cafe--this place sucked big steaming brown loafs! The service was atrocious, the menu very limited and expensive, and the food was dog shit. All big strip casino's have a diner/coffee shop usually open 24hrs, but this place was awful in every way, even the coffee sucked! Downscale, older places i have stayed at such the Imperial Palace, or Tropicana had better coffee shops. There also seemed to be a lot of small technical problems which were frequent. The card keys were stubborn and had to be inserted repeatedly EVERY SINGLE TIME I entered the room. When I contacted the front desk they talked down to me like i had in IQ of ten. Scripted, condescending answers and questions--""Did you insert the card right? Make sure the strip is facing this way, etc. etc"" I also had problems with my MGM-Mirage players card having to get a new card TWICE within a four day visit. Each time the ignorant, inept employee gave me a totally different (wrong) explanation on why my card kept malfunctioning. I hate it when places of business refuse to honestly answer questions and give scripted or made up bullshit answers. The final demonstration of incompetence was on my final day in Vegas when I had a slot machine voucher I wanted to cash in. The computers were down and it was impossible to cash in the voucher, even by going to a live teller instead of a machine. Thankfully the voucher was only for $7.67 but still... The only time the hotel incompetence worked in my favor was the mini bar in the room. Me and my friends had some of the tiny liquor bottles in the mini bar and should have been been charged approximately $36. Well, it's been over a month and no charge on my card! Woohoo! I shoulda drank more;) So, would I stay at the Mirage again? Probably not. Despite the reasonable rate of $77 a night and the nicely updated room and excellent location, there was just too much spotty service and general hotel incompetence to make me wanna risk it.

 I've come to like Solo quite a bit. I'm a professor at ASU and like to do a lot of writing off campus (continuing a habit I picked up in grad school). Solo is great for that. Meets my criteria: *decent number of outlets for laptops *seats that aren't too tiny and uncomfortable *free wifi (ask barrista for password) *espresso ground by hand, not by a machine *skim milk available *plenty of parking *air conditioning not too strong *not too crowded *music not too loud See? I'm picky about my coffee shops. The only downsides I've found are: *there's really no food at all except for the limited number of bakery items they receive each morning *like most coffee shops, pretty bad art and a lot of dust everywhere *too small As far as the coffee goes, it's fine. Not too nutty, not too burnt, not too acidic. I'm just glad to find a shop where there are no automated espresso drinks. Oh! And the biggest plus: friendly staff of adults who know what you're doing and why you're there and won't bug you so you can get your shit done. A++ WOULD BUY AGAIN. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Very nice ambiance and cozy breakfast place. I had the salmon breakfast bagel. It was really good, I don't think anyone can really mess that up. I haven't tried their coffee since I am a tea person. But the tea was served nice and hot. I wish they brought the tea to you instead of a more ""starbucks"" routine since this place is a big step up from starbucks. The staff was really nice and simple. My only complaints: There was a piano inside and it was beautiful. HOWEVER, someone kept playing it and it was so loud right in my ear, they should have put the piano outside on the patio lounge area so you wouldn't be trapped by the noise. The music being played in the background was not appealing. It reminded me of a teenager who overused eyeliner with emotional issues. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I typically love their beer selection and their food..... Until this happened: Hi, I came in with a group of 10 people on Saturday March 22nd around 730-8pm. We sat outside on the patio and our server was a young girl with pink hair. I believe her name starts with a D, that is what the receipt stated. I am VERY UNHAPPY with my service. I am a vegetarian and ordered a veggie quesadilla. I was served a PORK Quesadilla. I even took a bite, not thinking about it. She later came out and said not to worry that my veggie one was almost out. No remorse, no apology.... I WAS SERVED PORK AND I ATE IT. This is not acceptable. I live on Knox, very close to this establishment. I am furious that this has happened. I am also furious that the server didn't compensate me in any way for making a HUGE mistake!!!! I paid my bill, for my quesadilla but obviously did not tip her for doing such a terrible job. I would like to be compensated for the terrible service and for the huge mistake your employee made. She also broke a beer bottle next to our table and NEVER cleaned it up. We had to step over broken glass to leave. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I didn't actually stay here, my fiance's dad and his now wife did for their wedding/honeymoon, and we came here to visit them often. The place is very modern looking, clean and it's a relaxed vibe since there isn't a casino here. I hear it's a bit on the pricey side to stay there, but I think it's expected since it's newer and the overall decor kind of gave me that vibe. Each time we came in, we had to present to them the card key which I can understand why they would have to, I just remember thinking it was a little annoying at first. We ordered something at the cafe there and was not impressed at all considering the cost of the food (too much money when you know there are cheaper eats elsewhere). I can't remember what exactly I got, but I remember two things: my egg was fully cooked but it was supposed to be over medium and the asparagus was burnt, like literally black. One thing that was a little annoying was one of the days we were there, both card keys were locked in the room and we waited FOREVER for someone to come by and help us. One of us even had to call the front desk to make sure someone was still coming. We did notice a lot of people checking in, but I don't know, you would think they could allow at least the janitorial crew to let us in, even when we had all the proof in the world they were staying guests there so that we didn't have to wait for, I don't know, a half hour, maybe an hour, outside the room just to have someone unlock the door. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice hotel and all, but I'd probably stay at a different hotel within the City Center that's as elegant looking and costs just as much. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This is a spacious, clean and well organized Nordstrom Rack. There are many bargains to be had although a lot of the merchandise looks like it is direct to the Rack instead of merchandise that arrived via the Nordstrom stores. The entire back portion of the store is shoes and unlike some Racks which only have one shoe out and you have to go and ask a clerk for the mate, this Rack has both shoes out. Some of the discounts were not as deep as I would have liked on the higher end labels, but they were still a bargain. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Not bad but not great. I just visited Geno's for the first time looking for an authentic Philly experience, and this (i'm sorry to say) is NOT it. The atmosphere was not bad with plenty of seating and the game was on multiple TV's. The service was ok, nothing to write home about. The BIG disappointment was the portion size of the cheese-steaks. For $8.99 you would think it would be loaded with meat and toppings (like the picture's show) like Philly's actually are for the same price, but you will be SADLY mistaken. Do not waste your $$$ here if you can help it, I do not have the answer on a local authentic Philly yet, but this is not it...The search continues. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place is awesome! The only downside is that it's busy. They have more seating in an atrium area, but it is hotter than the main seating area. The coffee is pretty good but the bake goods are outstanding. The internet connection is reliable and free. The cliental is mostly hipsters. The staff is friendly and have always thanked me if I leave a tip (even if it's only a dollar). This place is worth a visit. ",0,0,0,1,0

 2.5 stars. For 6 chocolate bites, I paid about $15, which I feel I overpaid for chocolates that are just ok tasting. Many of the chocolates I picked out have this wierd, yet subtle sugary, grainy taste on the outside. If you were to try any of their chocolates, I would go for any of the truffles. Those actually taste a lot better than other chocolates, but I would probably head to Godiva next time. And yes, the lady behind the counter wasn't that nice to us either, but it's probably because she has to deal with drunkies all day long. That or having no customers at all. I would probably hate that job too. But after we were in there for about 10 minutes talking to her, she warmed up to us a tad. ",0,1,0,0,0

 First of all, I decided to have a massage on my last day of a hectic business trip because hubby raved about the best 25-minute massage he had ever had here at The Spa at ARIA. Unfortunately, the masseuse he had was not working the day I went in and mine, although professional enough, did not listen to my requests (a common theme at this resort) to focus on my back and shoulders and to increase the pressure. This just left me more frustrated and knotted up than beforehand. Getting to the spa is a bit confusing; the lack of signs is also a common theme at this resort. Stepping out of the ""spa"" elevator, you find yourself in a relatively dark hall, with the women's side on the left and the men's on the right. The doors have no handle; you wave your hand in front of a sensor -- that is, if you can read the tiny little instructions in the dark. Once inside the spa itself, I also spent time walking around in circles looking for certain areas. The funny thing is the large green, un-spa-like exit signs are everywhere, but you have to figure out where everything is on your own. There is a relaxation room in the women's side (I'm not sure about the men's side), but you have to go out and into the co-ed waiting room to get picked up for your service. This waiting room was filled with uncomfortable square couches which did not allow for any relaxing position whatsoever. It was also open to traffic on three sides, so you could see and hear people walking around and talking or pushing carts of towels around. Very non-relaxing. The women-only relaxation room was also the same room that you walk into from the elevator, and the noise and conversation of people checking in or out did not belong here. Two special rooms, the salt room and the one with the heated stone beds, are accessed just outside of the co-ed waiting room. Again, signs are practically non-existent. These rooms were unique, and I would have enjoyed them more if each bed or recliner were more private. The co-ed pool had a partially nice view of some distant mountains framed by buildings and a large neon sign of the Elvis show. It is basically an extra-large, rectangular jacuzzi; supposedly 33 persons max can fit in it, but just 4 of us was making me wanting more space already. The standard spa facilities included a nice steam room, sauna, cold plunge pool and jacuzzis for women- and men-only, and fruit, water and tea. The robes were all OSFM (one size fits most) but much too large for me. When I asked where the swimsuit dryer was, the first attendant didn't know, and another one said it hadn't been hooked up yet. In the shower, the hot and cold are reversed. Another design flaw of this spa is the toilet area is separated by a door to the rest of the spa facilities, but there are no sinks to wash your hands in before touching this communal door. Hubby confirmed this was the same in the men's side. Something was broken the day I was there, and the women's section smelled awful. I have no desire to return to this particular spa, except to try a massage from the therapist who worked on my husband (one extra star for her). ARIA's spa simply did not have an appropriate design or zen-like atmosphere. ",0,1,0,0,0

 If you know exactly what you want and don't need to speak to anybody then MAYBE go here. I have been in twice and on both occasions left an armful of goods behind that I had selected because of my inability to get anybody to help me with other articles. The staff seem to go out of their way to avoid you. The place is totally understaffed. You have to beg for help and then get a nasty look for interrupting a conversation with another staff member. If you need help with Bike accessories - FORGET IT. They have a so called bike specialist who both times was not in and nobody else in the store knows a thing. The line I was given is that they are trying to find staff. Are you kidding me, in this recession you can't find good people!! The best was when asked upon leaving the last time if I found everything I was looking for and saying, ""No there was nobody to help me"", the answer I got was ""Okay"". They don't give a darn about customer service and don't deserve your business. The worst part is that seems to be a common theme if you look at the reviews for other stores. BTW both times I was one of only 2-3 customers in the store. ",1,0,0,0,0

 This is your typical serve yourself fro-yo... In general, I think I'm running out of steam with this concept. For me, it's just getting old. The cups are always so big. I need to exercise a lot of self control to put that realistic amount of frozen yogurt in there and not go overboard. Can't they have a normal size cup? Just a rant-y sidebar; no stars off for this. We tried a sno-ball, which was really good. They had a ton of flavors for these. Considering that, in the summer, the Beach Bums Hawaiian Ice shack is only a little ways down the road - and they have more options as far as flavors and mixing with ice cream - I think I'd choose that over this. The store was clean. There was sort of a photo enlargement gone wrong on the tables. Anyone else notice this? OK, so I'm just entirely too tuned into weird details. Good service and good product as far as serve-yourself frozen yogurt is concerned. ",0,0,1,0,0

 This is what YELP is for and the Baladie cafe is for Yelpers! I can really appreciate a small privately owned place. I appreciate a place where the owners appreciate my business. It is a small place in a Vons plaza - but the Vons is closed. I have been by here a million times but never even thought about going in here for lunch. It is a tiny place with 5 or 6 tables. They have mediterranean food and greek food. I had the Gyro plate with some fries. The fries were seasoned and served with a flavorful dipping sauce. The Gyro plate had all the fixins for a gyro but it was unassembled. I liked putting it together. All the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. This place offers a great value. The food is quality eats... something you would expect in a finer establishment with higher prices. So for a quick serve place and quick serve prices - you get great food, real plates, and great service! Since I live in the general area it was refreshing to find a mom and pop joint mixed in with all of the chain restaurants.

 Well, I wanted to like this place. I was here recently with a bunch of coworkers, one who has been here many times in the past and was raving and even he said that this time, it was just ""meh"". I ordered the Rib Eye, rare...it was medium/well when I got it, dry and cost $50! Crazy! I also tasted the asparagus side (just ok), the large baked potato (just ok) some potato/onion side (greasy), the fries (cold) and I had a tomato salad (didnt care for that at all). What I'm saying here is, the food was WAY below par and the prices were outrageous!! I'm only glad I didnt pay for anything. If I had, I would have complained and sent the food back. The food quality was a joke. The service was fine and the atmosphere was fine as well however at the end of the day I only care about the food and it was not that great, end of story.

 This is my favourite bar to go to for a quiet drink. Though it's attached to the Cameo Cinema, you don't have to go there only if you're going to the cinema. Because it's normally associated with the cinema, it's almost guaranteed to have seats. It's not just good for a drink, it's also pretty good for a cup of coffee or tea during the day. It's a bit darker than I'd like it to be, but it's still got a great atmosphere at any time of day. It also serves as an exhibition space, and I've seen some pretty good artwork there. That plus all the oldschool film posters makes for a good vibe. They normally have wireless, though if your laptop isn't charged, don't go there to use the internet, as they're not actually allowed to let you charge your laptop or other electronic equipment there. They also have a few hot paninis and the sort to munch on there, as well as cakes and biscuits and nuts. Definitely drop by here if you want somewhere quiet to go, even if you're not going to the cinema. The staff are really friendly and have brilliant taste in music. ",0,0,0,0,1

 When we arrived, the bellhop a and valets very extremely friendly and helpful, but at the check in desk we found out that our booked room was taken, the receptionist seemed very stingey on making up for our reservation too. The hotel is very beautiful, with a very elegant young feel to it. In the room was when we realized they seemed to be nickel and diming. The refrigerator was full of all kinds of drinks but with very manipulative sensors installed that automatically charge once moved. We asked the bellhop to remove them entirely so we may use the refrigerator, he assured housekeeping will come in about 10 minutes to do just that but eventually never came at all. (Later in the trip we called to get more towels in our bathroom as 4 people use the amount house-keeping leaves in one day. They never came. ) When I tried accessing the wifi hotspot either my iphone or the redirection link to allow access did not work at all. I found out you need to open Safari to initiate any response, and even then there was some problem with billing issue which made us call the helpline. For the price of the room, I was surprised to discover that not only is wifi not free, but it is limited to only two devices regardless of if we had a double queen bed room. Inside the room we had noticed numerous switches broken, a wall plug that didn't work, and a pole to the balcony banister broken off. Not a dealbreaker, but c'mon. Overall it isn't the worst experience to be imagined but there was a lot of potential for having a great consistent customer experience, in which I did not receive. ------- Over the trip I decided that this hotel is good for meeting up at to find some pretty cool bars, but as far as customer service and staying at the hotel, it's irritated our friends multiple times this weekend.

 Mmmmm. Popcorn. Many, many flavors of popcorn. Sweet, savory. Chocolate, nuts. Buttery, salty. All of it. And MPK does it well. I love that they offer mini bags ranging from $2-$6. Forced portion control. If I was given a barrel of popcorn, I would somehow manage to get it down. So why only 3 stars? Less than impressive customer service. Now the lady at the front (owner?) is great. Very helpful and friendly. The girls in the back...not so great. I was in before Christmas to buy 13 mini bags...all different. Although there were numerous people in the back, there seemed to be more socializing than actual work going on. It took a good 20 minutes or so to get my order ready. I could have eaten the product faster than they packed it. No worries. The shop is fun to browse. But when my order was finally ready and I was heading out the door, an employee came out with a bag that they had missed. At this point, I knew they probably did not bother to double check my order, so I did it when I got to my car. Even with the bag they missed, I was still missing one...a $6 bag at that. Again, the lady at the front was very apologetic, but the gal working in the back was argumentative as she ""knew"" she had packed that particular flavor. She came out front to get my entire bag, so that she could go through it herself and see what was missed. Apparently, I am both a liar, illiterate, and unable to count to 13. So now I'm waiting again with nothing to do but wonder why they didn't do this before they gave me the order. Finally, she was sufficiently convinced the missing bag was, indeed, missing. Upon returning my order, she remarked it had been packed, but not given to me. I still might not have dropped my rating if not for the fact that while I was waiting for the sleuth in the back to solve her case, another customer came in complaining that she was missing 5 bags of her 20 bag order. Unfortunately for her, the order was for an office function that had already taken place. So moral of my long-winded review is to give MPK a shot if you're a popcorn lover, but make sure you check your order before you leave. They won't. ",0,0,1,0,0

 So i went here one late night freaking starving! So I decided to get something real quick. This carls jr was the first fast food I spotted. And my experience in this particular carls jr drive thru was theee worst service I have experienced in my life! First of all the woman at the drive thru took at least 3minutes to even respond and she got my order wrong twice! I actually had to pull up to the srive thru wondow because she could not get my order correct. Finally she gives me total with a rude tone and slams the window in my face while Im asking very politely if she can repeat my order. And to believe it or not that was only strike one for me! so finally she gets back to the window 5 min later (and I am not stretching the truth at all when I say she took 5 min) literally snatches the money from my hand (strike 2) and again slams the window in my face! Ugh! I was really getting to my very last nerve at this point. So she takes awhile to come back my food and of course she gets my order wrong. (strike 3) she over charged me! And surprisingly I kept my cool. So I drive away and get get home and she totally skimped me on my fries! I dont know if this lady was out to get me or if someone is trying to test my patience! who knows! Maybe she was having a bad day and decided to take it out on me?

 Please save yourself the trouble of living here. The apartments are ok and there are better ones in the area. Its Phoenix, AZ and the summer heat tops at 118 sometimes. Guess what, my units AC broke down 5 different times and they serviced it time and again until it broke down during one night. They would not provide you with any form of assistance but put you up with a portable unit they would install if the maintenance guy is in the complex. This complex was built in 1998 and painted again in 2012 before Lincoln took over. You can expect $200 + electricity bills in the summer if you are renting the bigger (2BHK and 3BHK) units. When this place was run by Archstone, it was a lot better. The front was much more cordial and easy to deal with. Look at them now! They are all as good as hoodlums and extremely rude. If you dare to finish your lease and leave them, you will be hit by some of the weirdest fees ever. You forgot a piece of paper while moving out? Guess what, thats $50 a piece of trash. Please stay away from this apartment complex. Only positive side is that the mall is right opposite to it. But yeah, thats a pain in the buttock if you hate noise.

 I went with my son and girlfriend. Evening service during the week. Very friendly servers. They seated us promptly and with casual conversation. The shrimp fondue looked so good we ordered it. Enjoyed the fondue, slightly runny but it was great on the chips and bread. As I ate a chip something hard was amongst the bite. I pulled out a 3 inch long white piece of plastic that had melted on the chip. They served rolls, The rolls were amazing except there was only 3, on the plate and they were golf-ball size. We constantly had to ask for more. It was as though they were small pieces of gold nuggets that they didn't want to share but were forced to. Granted the waitress (sorry, did not hear her name) did it happily. My son ordered the 12 ounce steak, which they ran out of and were willing to give him a free dessert if he ordered the 14 ounce steak. I asked if he could have the 14 ounce for the price of the 12 ounce, but they couldn't do that. I ordered the rib-eye. They brought out our food in a timely fashion. As I cut into my steak, the waitress came back to see how everything was. As she stood there talking to us I saw a hair in my food. She removed my plate to fix a new one. The manager quickly came to our table and informed us that she would not charge us for the meal. This is when I showed her the plastic that I had pulled from eating the chip. My 2 guests finished their meals when I received mine. I ate a little of it and it tasted wonderful. We ended up having something unexpected come up and had to leave. I placed my order for my daughter at home and my son placed his dessert order, to go. I was surprised to see she only took my steak off the bill. I was surprised due to the fact throughout the entire meal there were issues. Not having what they should or letting us know they were out, plastic and hair in our food. I understand you cant stop everything, and sometimes these sorts of things happen, but all at one time...embarrassing. I did give the restaurant 2 stars because beside the unwelcomed extras to our food, it actually had a very good flavor. I truly enjoyed the food and the friendliness of the servers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 went to Vegas last weekend for training. my cousin recommended goin to Firefly and stressed on how good it was... so we headed that way. i was hungry. hardly ate anything all day. training classes from 8 to 6 with only 30 min breaks in between hour and a half classes. had coffee for breakfast, and a nasty spring roll from a cheap ass wanna-be asian food place at the riviera. i was starving. we get to firefly and the place is packed. we were told it would be a 20 -25 minute wait. my stomach growled at me in anger. 20 - 25 minutes???? i just might pass out during that time. so next door was a different kind of fly.... dragonfly...an asian joint. we proceeded to check out the menu posted on the window. as we were doing that, one of the servers came out and assured us it was really good in there. they enticed us with an available table right at that very moment. the place looked pretty cool inside. not too big. one small bar in the corner. cool dragonfly decor on the walls. some kind of anime porn projecting against the wall... that was interesting. the service was good. our server was actually really nice and very helpful. i had a raspberry margarita. it wasn't too bad. they had a pretty big selection on the drink menu. i started with a miso soup which was actually not too bad.. i then had a volcano roll and it was... eh... ok. portions for very small, and not very cheap. and i was still hungry. so my friend and i decided to split a sampler with some rice. (we're so Filipino. ) probably not a good idea since the beef was pretty much raw, the chicken was too salty, and the meatballs were too mushy... overall the food was eh. next time i'm waiting for firefly.

 Love love love this place! We have eaten at some of the Cabo's in other Station's and this one is by far the best one. It does sadden me that each of them aren't has consistent as this one. Right now they currently have a special (obviously subject to change) where you can get Fajitas and a Margarita for $9.99 wish players card. The Margarita is on the rocks. The Fajitas are so tasty and have such good flavor. I take a tortilla and just rub it all across the skillet to let is soak up all the juicy flavor. For an appetizer we always get the ""Chili Con Queso"" it costs $8.99 but it so darn worth it. It it a good helping that you can munch on with chips then put on top of your food when it arrives. It is very thick and cheesy! The decor has all sorts of bold colors which my man doesn't like but I actually do. They have TV's in the bar and above the kitchen that usually have sports games on. The salsa is the only terrible thing about the food... It just doesn't taste fresh or like salsa. ",0,0,0,1,0

 These guys are great. I have a 2006 VFR800 that I bought from Apache Honda 2 months ago. The first week I had the bike things didn't seem right, so back and forth I went with them. I finally had enough and took the bike to Alex to do a once over and tell me what else they forgot to check before selling me the bike. They got me in the same day. Did a thorough job and walked me through everything that Apache Honda had missed or done wrong. They were able to get me in and get things fixed at a great price. After having it serviced at Alex it ran so much better it was awesome. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 is because of the customer service area. The area is clean, but the carpet is oil stained, etc. from the bikes (They store them inside at night). For me this was not an issue, but for some it would be. I highly recommend Alex for any motorcycle service. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Applebees food while it isn't the greatest, it is what you expect. So I went there with the expectation to have some pretty good food and a pretty good price and I wasn't mistaken. Food and price were what I expected and was worth it. The problem was the service. I walked in and the host was talking to the manager about something not work related. The host said hi, and then went back to talking. After a few more seconds and after the manager looked at me and looked away, the host decided to ask if I'd like a table. I said yes and that there would be one more joining me, so he took me to a table. The server took about 6-7 minutes to come and greet me and I ordered my drink. My friend came a few minutes later and I still hadn't gotten my root beer I ordered. After a few more minutes, the server came back and asked for her drink order and she ordered a pepsi. I still didn't have my root beer. After about 10 minutes he comes back with both drinks and we order. Food comes out fine and it tastes like what we expected but the server is no where in sight. So in the hour we were there, we interacted with the server 4 times. We both drank our drinks and needed refills and each time another server who happened to be walking by refilled them. The reason I gave them two stars is because the food is the only thing that saved them from getting a one star review for their service. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Totally overhyped!!!!! Good Buffet so far but let me Tell you we went to few openings wynn, cosmopolitan & every Buffet was good when they opened but After few Weeks prices went up quality down very sad& Bad. :-( The line for Lunch was about 1 Hour on a monday. Was it worth the wait. No maybe i m Not sure :-(. Cashier: omg sloooooooooowwwwww as hell they are Not Even friendly. Hello we waited 1 Hour so just give us a smile Girl Host: ok. Didnt explained anything. :-( just seated us. Its a New Buffet i expect more Motivation. Food: Good choices i loved the Pasta. The Guy was so nice & helpFull Desserts were excellent. But wicked Spoon s gelato is better Everything was Good Not excellent. Most of the stuff was cold. Decor & ambiance: nice very nice contemporary. Waiter: very very nice George i think???? Girls @ the desserts so nice & patient. All in all Price was ok for now. Who knows they will maybe change it soon? 48$ Lunch for 2 with the Reaards Card, Quality was Good but This is how it is when Buffets just Open. fresh squeezed oj. ;-) Why only 2 *? Almost None of the Things were labeled. I Really like to know what i m Putting on my Plate, Waiting Time 1 hour is too Long when just 1 cashier is staying there, the others were not existing ;-( restrooms Not existing inside or Maybe i missed it???! Nobody knows the prices???? They are Not Even Written outside. Why is it such a Big Secret???? All in all if they Improve& Hold the quality i will try it again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Make an appointment for registration....I went in thinking I could just register but there was something wrong with my account. Then 3 hours of my life passed, lunch was eaten, and then I got to talk to someone about the ONE class I needed to schedule.

 Ya know, it's really tough to enjoy a meal when your experience with the hostess rubs you the wrong way right when you walk in the door. We met some good friends there this past Thursday, and were there to use our groupon. They have a two year old - which normally isn't even worth mentioning, but that's where it went horribly wrong with the hostess. For some reason, she looked down on us - and not just because she's taller. Basically she said they had a table in the back where we wouldn't bother anyone with the ""child"". I realize that restaurants such as these are normally quieter, more intimate, less rowdy, so it's not what she suggested, it's how she said it. Our friend's child happens to be very well behaved, but she assumed we would be a distraction or a nuisance. The fact that she was a ginger, while not affecting her poor courtesy, is still worth mentioning. The server was attentive, for the most part, with the exception of drink refills. I can't comment on the quality of the steak, because everyone I was with who ordered steak ordered it wrong (medium well / well done). The food, for the most part, was forgettable, and unfortunately, we will not be back. Luckily it was a cheap night thanks to groupon!! ",0,1,0,0,0

 My one week stay at this Residence Inn was fairly good. My suite was clean and spacious. Nice comfortable living room and kitchen area. The A/C was controllable and did well throughout my stay. The first night the bed sheets had a mild bleach smell but after having them changed, I had no problems at all. The hotel staff and room service personnel were friendly and professional at all times. The complimentary breakfast was surprisingly good but not much variation but enough to start the day. The privacy at this hotel is great with several entrances besides the front desk secured by key card access only. The parking lot had plenty of spaces throughout the hotel and had no problems at all. The one issue I did have was with the laundry service. A few of my shirts were stained by an oily liquid which I was able to remove with a fresh wash once I made it home. Not professional at all and very expensive which is the reason I dropped one star. I recommend this Residence Inn and will definitely stay here again. ",0,0,1,0,0

 Oops. I guess my review of this place slipped through the cracks. I saw Human Nature about a year and a half ago (right after they opened as it turns out). I was never a fan of them back in Australia, but I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining their show is. I had no idea that they are such huge fans of Motown. Like probably everyone else, I just saw them as an Aussie boy band. The fact that they now headline a Vegas show sponsored by Smokey Robinson is strange to say the least. Little did I know, they actually started out singing those types of tunes back in high school. So really, ""Smokey Robinson Presents Australia's Human Nature"" is a return to their roots. It's not in my list of favorite shows on the strip, but it's certainly worth checking out, especially if you love Motown. And who doesn't love Motown? ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ok... i'm not getting the hype. The problem I had was that with everything good, came something bad. - Menu: huge selection of basic mom-pop italian food. The pizza is definitely the highlight, Problem was that it was too huge, including the goofy oversized menu that hit my partner in the head all the way across the table. -Pricing: pretty good. some things were high, some were low, but all in all i have to say pretty darn good for the portions. -Portions: We had the garlic cheese bread, awesome and HUGE - almost too huge though for an appetizer, to the point where it filled me up too much and i could barely finish my pizza! The pizza, as well, was HUGEEE (we got the chicago style - DO NOT get appetizers if you are getting a chicago style because you WILL NOT finish it, or even come close, be happy with pizza for the next week). On the other hand, we also got the ""zany zitti"" which was... well pathetic. Small and unsatisfying, served in a bread bowl, and i mean cmon how many carbs can one person have??? The flavors were boring as well - not something i would ever recommend, being i've made better at home from a box. -Flavors: Not bad, but not special. not surprising - so in my opinion, therefore not interesting. All in all - if my guy wanted to go back for the good pizza, i'd be ok with it, but its definitely not a place i'd drag my friends to on a good thursday night. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Went here about two months ago and am only now getting around to reviewing it. I think that should stand for something in terms of my experience there. The service was ridiculous. If one is going to charge the prices they charge for regular Americanized asian food... at LEAST make sure the menus you hand people are clean. Or your plates for that matter. Or silverware. Seriously! Did EVERYTHING have to be covered in grit or a mysterious sticky substance? Next up... the menu. Not everyone eats meat. How about a little more choices for us who prefer tofu over dead animal? I ordered the Coconut Curry Vegetables. Bland bland bland. I've had more flavor out of an unseasoned packet of ramen. And would it kill them to actually put some tofu on the plate? I guess I just don't understand the hype. The prices are ridiculous for the quality received. You're better off going to some little hole in the wall place where the food actually tastes like food and not reheated leftovers. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I finally went back to L'Avenue after a 3 year absence and was dying to see if it changed. I will keep this review short as everything has already been said about this place: Located in pretty much the hippest area in the city. Expect a long wait, especially on weekends (even at 2PM). Funky decor with the music to match with. As Montrealers, we tend to take all the breakfast restaurants we have for granted. Even our breakfast chains like Cora and Eggspectation are fantastic. I lived in California for a few years and there was this IHOP near my place which was always packed...an IHOP for God' sake! It turns out that it was better than the Denny's a few blocks down the street and those were basically my only two choices without having to drive miles for breakfast! ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ive been here a few times since its attached to the casino @ flamingo (where I sometimes stay) sometimes i get a margarita to-go, and other times I've chilled at the bar, i usually go for the ""Perfect margarita"" over ice along with some chips and salsa. i haven't tried any of the food yet. but the HUGE volcano nachos and the burgers seem to be heavily filling the tables when Ive come. The restaurant has two bars the 1st ones in the front of the restaurant and there's a (standing only) little patio which is facing out to the strip. good for people watching and catching a breeze where the weathers nice. the 2nd bar is in the back of the restaurant by the stage/projection setup For those who want a souvenir there's a gift shop @ the entry of the restaurant which sells glassware, margarita mixes, shirts,flip/flops, hats etc.. **tip #1 ** there's a 2-4-1 coupon for their ""whose to blame"" margarita in the fun book they give you when you stay @ the flamingo. (avg out $4 ea margarita!!) which u can drink there or get it to go! boo-ya! **tip #2** you get more margarita when u get it a to-go cupppp :) ",0,0,0,1,0

 Tried this on the recommendation of a co-worker. We won't be back. Severely over priced for very little food. The best thing I can say is my husbands very small steak was pretty tasty, however that doesn't make a meal and for the price of it there should have been more than a 4 Oz piece or other things to go along with it. I have the yellow tail with ponzu (some of the poorest ponzu I've ever had). And iced tea from concentrate, might as well have been drinking tin can.

 We went for lunch and had a duck confit sandwich on a fresh baguette ($12) and a Noca chop sandwich ($10). Both Top quality with the salad being probably the best I've ever tasted in Phoenix.

The rooms are nice. Very spacious. Nice lay-out. Nice balcony. Nice big TVs. The room was very clean, and maintained well during my stay. The front desk folks were very friendly. I checked in and out with no issues. Very speedy. The breakfast is good. Buffett is OK, but a bit pricey. menu items are a better option...

 I was just writing a review for Triple C and realized I have never written a review for Noda. Personally, this is hands down, my favorite brewery in Charlotte. I am an IPA drinker so maybe I am a little biased as they have an abundance (but never to many in my opinion) of IPA's. I prefer their original nodaryzed myself but also enjoy the Woody and Wilcox, Ghost Hop, and the new Pacific Reign. All are super hoppy and just the way I love them to be. All are higher gravity so be careful.

 I really wanted to add a romantic activity to our romantic night in Vegas with the hubby and the Gondola boat ride was added to the list ! First of all if you don't know your way around the Venetian please ask for directions or you will get lost in this giant hotel! After finally locating the ride we were instructed to go to a shop and pay for the boat ride. Ok so the catch is you can pay additional (80.00) and have the boat to yourself and your loved one(s) or you can just pay for you and your loved ones and hope you have it to yourself. I almost shelled out the extra money but decided against it. Good thing I didn't--the hubby and I walked to the boat dock and we lucked out and got a boat all to our lonesome selves!!! Winning! So our boat person was very friendly and had an Italian accent and sang and talked to us the whole ride. I guess you are paying for the singing because the ride itself sucked. I wish I surveyed the area of where the boat ride ends and we would have done something else. It takes 3-4 minutes or so to get to the other end (for the inside ride) and then you turn around and head back. The ride isn't that long and really not worth 20 per person. I wish we did the outside version but this closes earlier in October and colder months. I loved our boat person but we could have gone without this activity. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place has so much potential and unfortunately isn't tapping into it. For a prime location in university city I expected it to be busy on a Saturday night. To my surprise it had three tables seated. I was more so embarrassed because I had made a reservation. The service was good for the most part. Our server was in training but had a good understanding of what she was doing. They are privileged to have the best bartender in the city on their staff Daniel L. In terms of the food, it took more time than I would have expected for it to come out. I ordered a pizza and found myself slightly underwhelmed. Most of my toppings seemed to be thrown on after it came out of the oven, so my veggies were still raw. My husband got a panini which he ended up eating the next day (he filled up on apps) but said it was really good. I think with some more advertising and a broader menu this place could be a big hit. I will say, around 10 pm Saturday nights it turns into somewhat of a lounge and the atmosphere is pretty grown and sexy....I believe that's how the kids call it these days.

 The employees/students at EMCC are very friendly, however, they can be very unprofessional. I feel like students run the campus and the adults sit and watch. It's been almost a month for the entire Maricopa county school district to process my one piece of paperwork, holding me back from financial awarding. I've been in arizona for 4 years and this happens to be the most unprofessional school I've had to deal with. Never, have I witnessed such a lack of work ethic in a higher education facility. I'm not even sure I want to attend EMCC anymore, for the simple fact that I've spent months trying to get prepared for school, when they may not award me at all. Why should I have to call every week to make sure you're doing your job? I see no justification in that whatsoever. I have my own job to do, so I'd expect them to do their job, not laugh and giggle on the phone because you're not used to the technology. Isn't that the reason you're working at the school? To learn?? It just blows my mind that they take an entire week to process 1 days worth of paperwork. I hope they get it together soon, especially for the safety of my education. I'd hate to be taught by the same people that can't even file simple paperwork. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I'm no expert on Korean food. Before ordering from Kantapia I had eaten Korean food once in Toronto and it was delicious. I decided to try this place because it is near my job and I was tired from eating at the same restaurants. I was happily surprised to note that there were a lot of Korean people eating in Kantapia, which is always a good sign. As I was completely clueless about Korean cuisine, I asked a couple of questions to the waiter, who even let me taste the sauce for the Don Katsu (fried pork), which I ended up ordering for take-out. By the way, they have a particular take-out menu. It was absolutely delicious. The fried pork was filling yet not heavy. I was a little concerned about the purple rice but it was really good and sticky thus easy to eat with chopsticks. There was also a small salad. Overall, a great balanced meal. Best of all: The price. $10.06 with taxes. What is there not to love about a full meal for $10 or less? ",0,0,0,1,0

 i'm a local and decided to check this place out with a couple of friends. we decided to chill by the cozy pool and dip our legs into the jacuzzi. we loved the fire and waterfall features. the main lobby area was very comfortably laid out and inspires guests to mingle with each other. the beds by the pools were very comfy and i loved the little sand bonfire.

 So much fun!! Relax and let your inner artist shine!! I have been to 5+ BPs and they have all been a blast! The Instructors are very helpful and let you paint whatever you want. I like to 'bend' whatever the subject is, so I like the freedom. I marked 'inexpensive' for price. I feel that (especially w a coupon) the price is more than reasonable for what is included. They have moved from the McKinley location. They are now just North of Roosevelt on the East side of Central. Best to get there from Roosevelt as Central is one way there. ",0,0,0,0,1

 ED HARDY'S FAVE HOTEL. LIKE WASSUPPPPP!!!! There are a lot of very good, and very bad reviews for this hotel. I kind of read them like ""idiot"", ""brilliant"", ""idiot"", ""brilliant"", and so on... That should tell you something. I almost feel like writing, ""trust me, stay away"" and not go into all the miserable details of a completely lousy Vegas experience at Epic levels. - no soap or shampoo available. Nope. you must pay 24 dollars for that cleansing privilege. - check out is at 11. If you are late, or you want to stay in for an extra 30 min, or 5 min, or 1 min, they charge you 100 bucks an hour if you can believe it. Wow. Even the prostitutes that hang out at the bar have better rates than that. - they charge around 15 bucks to your bill for...well...nothing...hotel service fee. The lady at reception said it was how the hotel brings in more revenue. Uh huh. I get that. But how in the hell does a hotel charge me for nothing? I mean, 15 or 150, the principle is the same. Complete scam job. - tiny, teeny, weeny, little towels. Enough to cover my leg. One of them. Again, no bloody soap!!! not even a bar. Sick. Even motel 6 gives you soap. And now I'm naked with no towel and dirty as sin! - food all around mediocre. Nobu is the biggest joke on earth. Oh, I'll save that review for another time along with the silliest fake-Italian restaurant. Mama mia, e bene - says the large fake-Italian man who should compete with Adam Sandler for who can do a worse accent. - Service: well, think what would happen if the same people who were part time prostitutes/drug dealers/musicians/Ed Hardy fans, etc. all got jobs in the service industry running a hotel and now you know who you will be dealing with at the Hard Rock - Clientele looks like they all just broke out of Arkham Asylum and/or an Ed Hardy fan museum. Seriously, this is a fun place to hang out at for 20 minutes and then your head starts to pound from the drugs someone dropped in your drink and you wake up pregnant in a 3rd world country as a love slave. At least that's what happened to me. Please, Mom, if you're reading this...save me. The guy who has me wears a trucker hat with swarzky crystals... STAY AWAY. Big waste of money hotel, hiya Tai-Pan. Me thinks you wanchee go elsewhere hotel no lying, hiya? Like Motel 6 where they have free soap and towels! Yay. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Ordered the personal pizza. disappointing. Then dough is cut from a larger, refrigerated ball. It is then ""massaged"" into the size needed. No throwing pizza to size. Even for the larger pies, I didn't see the usual pizza toss. Perhaps it's done in the back of the store? Crust is a bit thicker on the personal pie than the regular NY pie. Crust is bland and tasteless. No spongy/crusty olive-oily flavors at all. Tasted like pre-made cardboard. The base sauce is only average and has a canned, institutional flavor. I'll give them more time to improve, but if this is the best they can do, the shop isn't going to last very long. UPDATE: I can't let John A's review go unchallenged. I'm a local who loves NY pizza. this isn't a ""strategic"" pan of a pizzeria. mama Theresa's has a LONG way to go and using commissary provided canned drek as fresh ain't gonna cut it! want good NY pizza? try Luigi & Sons in Rock Hill on Cherry Road! first Generation Neapolitans and a great family affair that has been serving the community for years!

 We saw the event on Yelp and wanted to check out the Grand opening.. It was extremelyyyyyy packed..It was hard to even find a seat because it was so busy. We ended up finding one, and I'm not sure if there were even waiters or waitresses because no one ever came to help us. We ended up finding seats at the bar and sat there. So I originally wanted to try their mac and cheese. & guess what, they were out.. Bummer. I ended up getting the Caprese. This has chicken, mozzarella, tomato, basil. Let's just say I liked their fries more than the entree. I think the truffle fries were the only good thing here. My boyfriend ordered the union grilled steak burger. This thing was smothered in bbq sauce. & they made it way too hot because he burned his hand when the sauce dripped. It was extremely loud and packed when we went. I couldn't hear anything anyone said. The only highlight was getting to see some of my Yelper friends there. I won't be back. ",0,1,0,0,0

 As soon as I knew I was traveling to Pittsburgh for work, I searched on my Yelp app restaurants and things to do near my hotel. One of the places I bookmarked was Meat & Potatoes. Talking to one of my Yelp friends, the night before I left on my trip, he recommended this same place so, now, of course, I must go. I arrived in Pittsburgh on a Wednesday. That night, I went straight to this restaurant. I could see it was busy but, I only needed a table for one so I thought I would be able to get in. Nope, it was 100% full and wait time was about 1.5 hours. Good sign... week day and this busy, must be really good. So, again, using my Yelp app I made a reservation for Lunch the next day (should have done this from the very beginning...) They opened at 11:30am, and my reservation was at 12:15pm. I arrived right on time and was happy to see it wasn't crowded this time so, plenty of seats to choose from. I sat right in front of the bar, where I could see the mixologist working her magic. My server was great, friendly, always with a smile, and gave excellent recommendations. I was between a pasta dish and the mussels. Since it was lunch time, she said the pasta would be too heavy and I would definitely have leftovers (not practical when staying at a hotel) so I went with the mussels which I love, and can say they have one of the best dishes I've ever had. It's an almost endless mountain of mussels in a coconut milk, lemongrass, curry broth, with cilantro and chili. The chili is spread out through the mussels so you get the heat from it on some and it's absolutely delicious. On top of that it comes with half a loaf of perfectly made garlic bread. I'm not a fan of garlic but this, I could not resist, it is divine by itself and even better when dunked in the broth. This dish is truly outstanding... you can see for yourself, check out the picture I took and tell me your mouth is not watering immediately... Other thing I love is trying signature drinks, especially when you see a bar like the one at Meat & Potatoes. Equipped with every tool necessary for a mixologist (not a bartender), glasses of every type, herbs, bitters, fruits, you name it, they have it. After looking through the ""Libations"" menu I went with the Vieux Carre - hennesy cognac / bulleit rye / cocchi vermouth di torino / benedictine / angosutra & peychaud. My server described this as an ""in between a Manhattan and an Old Fashioned"". They add one of those big blocks of ice to keep the drink cold and not watered down, and a lemon rind. It's elegant, strong, but smooth and with a touch of sweetness, excellent for sipping and enjoy the beautiful bar. They also have outside seating, which I'm sure would be very enjoyable on a beautiful day or night but, personally, after seeing the d \ u00e9cor and bar inside, if I ever have the chance to go back, that's where I would like to be. Where I can see those wonderful drinks be created and the amazing food is just steps away. Regardless of what time you go, where you sit, or what you order, I assure you, one visit is all it takes to become a fan of this place. To those living in the area... lucky you! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Ok, I cannot seem to find a friggin laptop cord that will charge my 5 year old laptop (I know, I know, that's like 10 trillion years in technology years, I must be some cheap ass fruit for not throwing this one into the heap at the dump and conforming to mass consumerism. I am an idiot who does not deserve to find a replacement power cord. But I digress...). So, after determining that I would only find universal crappy cords that would not work on eBay, Hubby and I decided to bite the bullet and... actually drive to a store... and buy one- just like we used to in the good 'ol days. This Radioshack is very near to our house so we swung in. Much to my surprise, there were 2 very helpful women working the floor. They even opened packages and attempted to charge the laptop while we were there. We wound up spending $108 (on a stupid cord which we later found out powers the laptop but doesn't actually seem to charge it, so I guess it will be going back) and walked out decently happy. So, even though overpriced and not perfect, I guess technically we got what we needed and the service was pretty good. On a side note, I am only giving the overall experience 4 stars- for some reason every experience I have ever had with a Radioshack indicates that it attracts douches (I hope this isn't a reflection on me going there). There was a total jerk customer who was jerky to my little boy and kept saying stupid things like ""WOW, this is a LOT of batteries for $9.99, what would I even DO with ALL these batteries??"". Yes, jerk, it is a good deal. Don't buy them if you don't need them. And a weird guy with a boy who seemed be trying super hard to seem super smart and know-it-all-ish. Great, I don't need to know that your dumb parents saw fit to give you a cell phone at the ripe old age of 9 or that you understand blue tooth technology. Anyway, its not Radioshack's fault that they have moronic customers, but it is a tribute to their outdated marketing, store displays and organization, and somewhat lame variety of slim pickins cell phones and remote control Tonka Trucks. If they would just try a bit harder to join this century instead of making time stand still they would probably do better. But what do I know, this is all just my opinion. Anyone know where a loser can get a functioning power cord for a 10 trillion year old Gateway laptop? ",0,0,0,1,0

 I must say first of all that my initial visit here was mind blowing. I don't think I've had a dining experience like this in a loooong time. I walked in and was greeted by too-cute Chelsea. She's adorable, friendly and engaging. She's definitely a great place to start the dining experience. She even remembered me the second time I went in (and where I sat!). Then Toni (I hope I spelled that right) greeted me. She's the perfect waiter. She takes your order, gets you what you need without a bunch of talking, but not rude or silent, she checks back with perfect timing and is just on point. And the food. WOW. It was SO delicious. I had the sweet-chili glazed salmon salad. I asked for the dressing on the side and it came out and was beautiful. This salad is the salad to end all salads. The salmon was cooked perfectly, the togarashi tofu needs to be a menu item by itself. It was a taste explosion! The salad is substantial and is really something so above and beyond what you think you'll get at a chain (and you'll forget it's a chain soon enough - this food is more than on point!). It's divine. The second time was almost a crushing disappointment because of my previous experience (although it wasn't that bad, I was just so hoping for the same one). The waiter was okay. He wasn't friendly, he didn't come back and ask how my salad was (I got it again!). He filled my drink up okay. His service just felt rushed, sort of, even though the restaurant wasn't busy. I got my salad with the dressing on this time. NOTE: DO NOT EVER DO THIS. It was DRENCHED. I almost gagged with all the salad dressing on it. I won't make that mistake again. The salmon again was cooked perfectly, but this time the tofu tasted like cold tofu. Ick. I also had the edamame, but you can't really mess that up so it was fine. All in all this restaurant has my heart if only because the people are so incredibly awesome and as long as Toni is there forever (with cheerful Chelsea!) I'll totally be back. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This Outback is in a great location for shopping at some fun stores and the parking is easy. The food was served up quickly, our server was polite and efficient in taking care of our needs, and everything was clean. The downside was the food prep - we wanted un-buttered steaks but when they came out they were very obviously covered in it. It's not a deal breaker and we didn't have time to wait for a ""do over"" since we were on our way to another place after. I actually prefer the steaks un-buttered at Outback since it brings out the flavor of their seasonings more. Everything else was prepared to order and we will definitely go back again since this is the first slip up we've had at an Outback in some time. Overall: A- ",0,0,1,0,0

 I will not be going back to this Capriotti's Shop!! First, I made a credit card purchase and one of their employees used my card and charged $140.00. The owner called me and told me how did I know it was his store and I told him that I had not used my card before then or after then. He told me that someone could have written my number down months ago and used it the same day that I came into his store. He then told me why was I upset since I did not make the charges the bank was going to credit my money. I told him it was the principle and then he called me ""sweetheart"" and I told him not to call me that. Then he said what did I want him to do? I told him nothing. I wanted him to know and now that he knew and since he got nasty he could do absolutely nothing and I told him to have a nice day and I hung up. I do not know why people think you are always out to get something. Maybe owners need to understand that if their employees take peoples credit card numbers and charge $140.00 worth of merchandise on someone else maybe they need to call you with sincerity in their voice versus attitude and disgust. Instead of acting like it could not have happened or it was your fault for purchasing with your debit card maybe an apology would have been better. But let me be clear I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK TO THIS CAPRIOTTI'S BECAUSE OF THE OWNER!!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Oh, where do I start? I too would have given this hotel a big fat zero!!! I have stayed here before and had a great time. This time around it was AWFUL! It started with checking in, we did get to check in early which was cool! Yay this is going to be a great trip!!! UNTIL... we get to our room seemed clean except a little dusty (I'm allergic to dust so that was fun) as we are unpacking we get a knock on the door. Hello, are you checking out today... hmm no... we just checked in.. oh?! says the supervisor... great... let's hope they cleaned the room...and off we go about our day... I do say.. we had a good view that we paid for of course they didn't have any free upgrades available.. good thing I didn't tip the desk person before asking.. We woke up to stained sheets.. awesome... although laundered who wants to wake up to blood stained sheets?! Now the fun begins... We obviously went down to tell the front desk whom had no clue who was in charge.. ""I'm sorry you'll have to talk to the people down there (points to the other end of the LONG desk"" when we arrive there we hear ""I'm sorry you'll have to talk to the people down there (right where we just were) and OH I can't help you I'm not logged in"" hmm right.. We did get the manager and she was great. She quickly helped us and ended up getting a credit applied to our room.. plus the sheets changed.. Sounds great right? Until we tried to use this credit! Wait for it this happens later... Off to the pool. The pool was great! Make sure you go get your drinks and food the wait staff is soooo slow! It's worth paying for the poolside seats and don't let them make you pay 50 bucks they will give it to you for 40! Just say someone told you. seems they don't have a set price. OH the food at the pool was the best in the whole hotel no joke! and it didn't cost 20 bucks for a 5 dollar hot dog! Just get up and get it yourself LOL So, we have this credit right so let's spend it at the pool right? Well, the credit wasn't on our account.. really?! more excuses from the front desk on how it wasn't their fault that it wasn't there blah blah blah.. the manager at the spa made it happen all good again... however loosing more time.. The gambling (tables) were good but I noticed that the guests were not tipping so please tip people these guys make min wage! Plus it's much more fun when the dealer is happy! The slots were sooooo tight it was like gambling in Seattle horrible! OK, we go to check out late.. called the front desk to make sure we use up the last of the credit and make sure that we use it for late checkout.. what credit.. holy moly not this again! another half hour wasted going through all the BS (Remember this is the highlights of the trip) and once again we get to hear the ""it wasn't me, not my fault blah blah"" finally get the OK to stay late and check out at 1pm. Off we go on our way... Until 12:30 when we go to retrieve our things from our room... the keys don't work... the desk didn't advise us that we had to get new keys.. really?! now that's the way to take care of your already mad customers.. we call the front desk AGAIN explained what happened and again not my fault blah blah OH and they say... we have a new system and everyone is having problems with it (that would explain why you don't get your mlife points).. they sent security to let us in.. never showed.. we had to go down and get security ourselves... As we are on our way to the airport we are expecting a credit to our credit card for now our free upgrade... and we get an email from the front desk that we now have a zero balance charge.. seriously??? we have to call again? So needless to say.. even though the MGM owns this place it seriously sucks! My friends stayed with us and didn't upgrade but... housekeeping broke her phone charger and it was like pulling teeth to get a credit to her credit card to replace the charge and went on a hunt to get a charger. awesome... OH... the ""free internet"" was awful! so slow! I just used my iphone! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I am rating Senor Taco based on 2 items: California burrito + chicken/steak fajitas. I love the fact that they offer these two items and it's a great escape for me when I am craving them (which happens quite often).

Good portion sizes though and a decent salsa bar. ~3 stars for now. ",0,0,1,0,0

 I don't get it? I don't understand the fascination with Culvers? The food costs twice that of Wend's, Mc D's, Hardys, or Burger King, and with the doubling of the price it has double of the grease! They figured if you ""butter toast"" the buns you can serve stale bread and know one will know. If you order through the drive through you will be given a number and have to wait. Worst yet if you order a sundae you will get it first while you wait 15-20 minutes for you order to cook. Just in time for you to enjoy you sundae as soup. Worst yet it is not ice cream it is ""custard"". A frank'en food knock off of real ice cream. Oh, and the fry's are soggy. I don't get it.

 I feel compelled to update and add a third review. Although this place has good food and I have gone four or five times now I am very upset over how rude we were treated today on 9/12/13. The woman who works the counter is always a bit off and snappy but today she was actually very ugly to my friend and I did not appreciate it. Sadly it was my friends first time visiting. What a horrid first impression. My friend is so sweet she felt the need to apologize profusely only for asking questions about the menu and food allergies. I told my friend that she had no right to apologize since it was the woman's fault not hers. The woman who works behind the counter does this type of thing all the time but today she was extra special nasty. I hate to tell her but you never know who your customers are so you should respect all. ( if she only knew-lol) The weird thing is that all the other workers in this restaurant are extra delightful and excellent. I guess they make up for Ms Grumpy and Overwhelmed. I understand having a bad day and am usually very forgiving of that having worked in many restaurants myself. However, you should never sigh, bang the counter, yell and scream, continue to shout, ""15 minutes to closing time"" and complain about how dirty your customers are within earshot of them. Also, rolling your eyes at a costumer for only asking about your Delish food is usually frowned upon in good costumer service manuals. This worker is the odd ball for sure. ( Lordy is she the owner? That would be funny. Funny sad, not funny, haha) I don't believe I will come back unless this is corrected. This is not NYC's Seinfield's Soup Kitchen. ",1,0,0,0,0

 Traded timeshare here for a 1bdr w/ partial kitchen that sleeps 4 (as advertised). The resort and service was great. Wished we had gotten a larger room but this what was available at the time. If you're looking to bring your family of 4 here I would recommend at least getting the 1bdr w/ full kitchen as the smaller 1 bdr option will be a bit tight and just become smaller towards the end of your week's stay. I would come back here but I definitely would go bigger if you're planning on bringing your family here.

 You can't get anymore authentic than actually going to Mexico...San Diego was pretty close though. But now that I live in Las Vegas I can't seem to find a Mexican restaurant that can live up to Mexican authenticity. So I did a drive-thru order for a chicken chimichanga burrito. Got the order paid about $9 with the extra $1 debit/credit card charge. Hmm. Brought the food to my hotel room...ate it. Disliked it. Too salty. Got mad. Threw half of it out. Still hungry.

 I probably would have given this restaurant 2 1/2 stars if I could have, but didn't think it deserved a 3 star rating. The term ""meh"" definitely applies here - nothing exciting with the food, drinks, service or atmosphere. The homemade chips, guac and salsa were all bland and the portion size was very small. My sandwich and my dining companions' burgers were very bland. Oh, and don't order the sweet potato fries. If you're looking for a burger/sandwich/fry place you can find much better in Madison, or even Middleton! ",0,1,0,0,0

 Tacos N More has become a standby for us here in the Copa.... Don't want fast food and don't want to drive to town - lets go have Tacos! The staff are very friendly - the place is clean and the food is good. We usually get to-go - having a Mexican Coke or Mike's hard while we wait. Almost everything is available a la carte - though the beans and rice are good - I usually just go for the main course! Carnitas - yummy. Seasoned Pork - also yummy. Carne Asada - has a good flavor, but I usually find a gristle piece and get grossed out (weird I know). Ground Beef - also very good - and not your mama's orange seasoned meat but course ground and flavorful. Tamales - delish (last time we were in there they suggested them enchilada style - yum!) Rolled tacos - Very good. Hubby likes the quac - and 2.50 for a big container isn't bad at all. Also a nice salsa bar. I think my only complaint is the chips - they are thick and kinda stale tasting to me. *insert catchy jingle music here* Next time you're in the copa - come and try some tacos! And Moreeeeeee!

 Started working out at LA boxing since it first opened up this location to work out my cardio and actually learn how to fight and always find it convinent that this gym was just down the street from me. Unfortunately been gone for a couple months because traveling for work and go out of shape. ;( Finally come back and decide to get back into shape to only to come back to find new staff members and trainers working there and alot more people there. But truthfully, I don't mind. Started right back where I left off working on my cardio, boxing etc. because of the awesome staff. Truthfully, this new trainers are more hands on and more motivated then the former trainers. And another upside is the fight team they have during the work. Could actually go light sparring and work on the mitts a lot harder than normal. People think its too much to pay for this gym but truthfully they never really been to a ""fighting"" gym in las Vegas where they offer weights, classes, personal training and a ""fight"" team classes.

 God awful service. The cashier didn't say ONE word to me. Not even one! There's food on the ground and merchandise misplaced throughout the store. The owner of this 99 cent only store really needs to get his or her act together. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Me and my friends got the buffet pass where you pay fifty dollars for a wrist band and you have 24 hours to hit as many buffets you want in these designated seven hotels. We hit three - Planet Hollywood, Flamingo, and Carnival World Buffet. We definitely saved the best for last with this buffet. Most of the food was extremely good! Of course, being a huge buffet, some of the food is not going to be as good. But id say i loved 80 percent of what i ate. Even though 50 percent were crab legs. ",0,0,0,1,0

 The first time I went here was as the guest of my cousin for her work X Mas party. She is a grade school teacher as were the rest of the attendees, so to say this was pretty low key is an understatement. It was a great time though and the food was pretty tasty. The staff was attentive and the atmosphere was really enjoyable. This positive experience, however, really set me up for disappointment when I decided to meet some friends here for a regular bar evening on Friday. First off, I thought swingers bars were only the subject of crazy mishaps and investigations on CSI and Law and Order. Turns out, they really exist and this is it! It was the bar's 10 year anniversary so there was free champagne, a live band (they were actually really good) and tons of 40+ year old cougars on the prowl. I spent most of my evening on the patio as to hopefully not catch anything but a draft of wind, if ya know what I mean. Unfortunately, after the third request to turn the heaters on, the waitress informed us that all but two heaters on the patio were broken. Guess they were just there for show or to create the illusion of warmth, like the fire pit that didn't actually work. I was told by a fellow patron that this was a swingers bar at which point I thought he was making fun of all middle aged people on the dance floor bumpin and grindin (I still can't get these images out of my head). On my way to the bathroom though, this sentiment was confirmed. A very friendly and intoxicated woman walking in front of me pointed to a door and said ""I have seen no less than 8 couple bang (she used another 4 letter word, but let's try to keep it clean here folks) in there"". She then proceeded to tell me that Cocomo Joes's and her husband cheated on her after they frequented the bar for the last 5 years of their marriage when they were in an ""open"" relationship. I felt bad for a moment until she blurted out ""all is forgiven now that I found my sugar daddy here"". She wasn't kidding. Although I got quite the kick out of the people watching, I can only pray that this isn't me in 20 years. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're into that sort of swinger thing... ",0,1,0,0,0

 We stopped in here after dinner in the area. Even though we'd already eaten, I always like to look at menus to see if it's a place worth coming to for food. Their menu looked excellent with some very unique takes on typical bar food. The beers are interesting and there is a great variety of offerings. The prices are really good for their drinks and the pours in the mixed drinks are generous. Also, Kim, the bartender, is awesome! I caught that they had undercharged us on our bill and when I brought it to her attention, she just smiled and said ""No big deal! Don't worry about it!"" She got a big tip. The patio is also dog friendly and huge! This is a really fun place where a lot of people seem to be regulars and it was definitely hopping. I would come here again for sure. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I can understand why some people give this place 5 stars and some shrug their shoulders and say nothing special. The burgers here are ground fresh by an in house butcher and the meat is good, not greasy and very juicy. IMHO, if you added some ground chuck you would get even better flavor but overall they have some of the best tasting burger meat out there. They cook on a griddle that is heated by burning hard woods, an interesting concept but to be honest I could not taste any smokiness to the meat. Also, IMHO, grilled meat tastes better, but griddled meat is juicer. The burgers are served on what appears to be a Portuguese style bun, rather plain tasting they add very little to the burger itself. Toppings are simple lettuce, tomato, onions, etc. Their goal is to highlight the meat and not cover it up with lots of toppings or sauces. On the side I had the home-fries, which they suggested, and to be honest they were disgustingly gross. Overcooked lumps of potato and onions saturated in grease that not only looked bad but didn't taste very good either. I like the ambience of the local burger joint, but thought a burger for $ 9.00 was pretty spendy. Service was good. Bottom Line: Some of the best meat that I've had in a burger, it was cooked perfectly and very juicy - skip those home fires (yuck). If you are burger purist, enjoying a plain all American hamburger with nothing fancy you will love Tessaro's, if however, you like a more complicated burger with lots of dressings / sauces and complex toppings you will find Tessaro's lacking. So why three stars? 1 off for the home fires and 1 off for not grilling the burger over that hardwood. ",0,0,1,0,0

 On one hand, I love tapas like I love my children so I would like to have given this a 5-star rating. On the other hand, the recommended items were average and a couple of the items were just not very good. The reviews on Yelp had prepared me for the lackluster setting in a stripmall but the restaurant is nicely appointed with Spanish ambience (music, art, wine). The service was attentive.

 Definitely an experience. I've always drive by this restaurant and wondered what it would be like to eat up there. I finally got the chance to take my bf up here for his birthday. Great place for an occasion or romance. In order to make a reservation, you need to give them a credit card. Interesting. The view is beautiful. You can go see the strip at sundown and the Bellagio fountains. The tables that we were seated near the window is very tiny. Barely have any room. I liked how they had a bread tray to choose from 4 different types of bread. I recommend the rustic; more Frenchy. Service was good, not excellent like what I expected from a high-end restaurant. Wild Escargot on Sweet Garlic Souffle: I wouldn't have known they were snails. Didn't look like it didn't taste like it. For an appetizer, it was extremely tiny, smaller than my palm. Lamb chops: Umm...that price for 3 bones of lamb? That is seriously outrageous although it was mighty delicious and it melts in your mouth. Beef Wellington: This isn't what I expected either after watching all these cooking shows. It was technically a meat pie with a huge cube of filet in the middle. It was good and filling but not really expecting it. Potato Gratin: Extremely creamy. I knew it was going to be rich but this took it to the next level. Wild Mushrooms: If you're going to get a side, get this. Armaretto Souffle: You must allow 45 minutes to order any Souffle and it is well worth it. It was a light delicious cloud of armaretto. Banana Tower Thingy: Love the white chocolate crisp with a crap ton of bananas. It was super impressive but I would got for a souffle instead. After each meal, they give you as much petit fours your heart desire. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Wow. Worst customer service and hotel experience of my entire life. Stayed here for a bachelorette party June 26-29th 2013. After spending the day at the pool, we came back to our room to find raw sewage, yes, SEWAGE filling the sink and spilling onto the floor. Ruined all of our makeup, hair supplies, you name it. Obviously this situation was out of our hands so we called the hotel front desk immediately. We were on the phone for about 30 minutes and never got to talk to a manager. A half hour later, they sent up a security guard and a cleaning crew. Even though we were upset, we tried our best to be friendly to the security guard and cleaning crew.. what a terrible job to have! One of them said ""This happens all the time""..... WHAT? Raw sewage spills into rooms all the time? We had to claim every single item that was ruined.... meaning that we had to empty our sewage soaked makeup bags onto a towel and touch every single piece.. writing down its brand, description and cost. If we didn't, we woulnd't get any money for our ruined products. Poop EVERYWHERE. OH, I forgot to mention that it was my friends Bachelorette party and that was the night we had planned to go out. How were we going to get ready? We thought the hotel might be a little bit sympathetic to our situation and asked if we could get our makeup/hair done for the evening....not a chance!! After arguing with people over our situation we decided to call it quits and ask for some toothbrushes.... they agreed and never sent them up!! We ended up having to buy them and get reimbursed. What a joke!!!! They moved us to a different room about 2 hours later. When we checked out, we realized that our room wasn't comped!!!! Not even for that last night! 2 months later and we are finally hearing from claims about crediting us for our ruined makeup. We are only getting half of what we claimed!! This experience was really disappointing. I plan on posting this on any and every travel review website possible. Apparently raw sewage spills into the rooms all the time... even if you don't see it, doesn't mean it wasn't there!!!!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 Definitely a great show. Just don't bring your kids here. The contents of the show are nothing out of the ordinary, but the raunchy humor that is mixed in made it very enjoyable. Just fyi, the seats are very uncomfortable. They are literally any sort of folded chair cramped in a small circle around the performers. If you sit in the front, you are more likely to get picked on by the hosts. Still, I would recommend this show for anyone who can enjoy some dirty humor. ",0,0,0,1,0

 After eating at the Buffet at Wynn the previous night, Bayside Buffet cannot compare at all. My family and I came here for a quick lunch which cost us about $20/person, which is relatively cheap. Dinner is only $28! Limited menu items, and only about 50% of the food actually tastes good. I had about 3 plates, and had the waitress take away the plates with most of the food remaining on it (I know, it was such a waste, I felt really bad). It just wasn't that good... I mean the food is still edible, just I'm spoiled when it comes to good food! The only plate that I actually finished was the fourth plate, which was made-to-order pasta, which was mediocre. I also didn't like that the desert bar is all the way across the other side of the buffet. Me being a fatass, I was too lazy to walk over to the other side, so I can't comment on the desert. I remember back when they first opened and their food was really good. It seems to me the buffet and overall quality of the hotel has degraded extremely in their standards over the past few years. It's a good place to go if you're on a budget and not expecting much. Otherwise, stick to the Wynn! ",0,1,0,0,0

 My wife absolutely loved her turkey burger, and the fries were decent if not spectacular. So why the 2 star rating? The service was absolutely awful. This was at the South End food truck meet up on Friday night. By the time we got there (8ish) the lines were dying down. My wife ordered from here while I went elsewhere to order. The line was longer where I went so by the time I got back she was already waiting for her food. Then we went to Common Market to pick up a couple of beverages. We came back and my food was just coming out. Hers was nowhere to be seen. It was another half hour before it came out. I was watching the whole time and it wasn't like they were overloaded with orders - it took them between 5-10 minutes to put out each order. Absolutely crazy! My wife liked her burger so much that she said she would eat there again, but it will have to be without me because I won't wait. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I've been a member since Jan 2009. It's been a good place to go since it's close to where I work -- I can't go home without driving past the gym so...yeah...no excuses. I have used almost every service available at the gym...seriously - yoga, massage, chiropractor, trainer, hair salon... YOGA - I LOVE LOVE LOVE their yoga classes. I have been to gentle yoga and the new HAPPY yoga class which is phenominal! Instructors are Robbie and Jennifer are all I've experienced so far and I am more than happy! MASSAGE - I have use both therapists - Angie and Kim. Angie is amazing! She's helped me heal from a wicked fall I had off a table. Kim is also amazing - the only problem I have is that I cannot afford to go to them more often. Massage is only $55.00 for 60 minutes if you're a member. Chiroproactor - nice guy - just hard to maintain because it gets expensive. He did help me get through some back issues - I'd recommend him Trainers - Core Concept is tricky - I have had a trainer there for about 19 months. I've lost some weight, gotten stronger, feeling better. I have had some inconsistency with my schedule and it has been hard to work with the ""manager"" of the Core Concepts. I would recommend meeting the trainers yourself and talking to them to see if you like them and if they can fit you in their schedule - less frustrating. It's pretty expensive but I need the motivation. I most likely will not renew again but they're helpful to get you started. I LOVE my trainer I just got. Melanie is AMAZING! Hair - They have a hair salon-- the owner is nice but he seemed to be chatting more with people passing by then with me when I was getting my hair done. Got a cut and color - it was kinda pricey and I didn't like the haircut - he didn't really listen to what I wanted. Overall, I'd recommend the place if you can afford it - it's got a great daycare - like most of the staff. Management and sales people are nice when they sign you up - otherwise, you're not really on their radar. ",0,0,0,1,0

 We saw the Penn & Teller show at the Rio on Thanksgiving Eve and were not disappointed. We had decided on this trip we would see two shows and we wanted one that was either magic or comedy, and another that was musical. Well you can probably guess which one of those this show isn't! But it is a good combination of magic, or really I should say illusion, combined with a good amount of comedy. It's really a very straight up front show, some great tricks, some good fun and no real over dramatization to boot. I liked that combination. I am a big fan of comedy duo's where there is the lively one (Penn) and the quiet/straight man (Teller) - they do this in a really good way. This is truly a really fun show and made for a good start to our trip. Penn is very clear everything in the show is just illusion and not magic, and while I would hope most people actually realize that, it is Vegas so anything goes and for all I know maybe there was a Harry Potter convention in town and so they felt the need to make the point. Regardless, some of the tricks were quite amazing, and other than a couple of parts of the show where the conversation from Penn got a little too much and you wanted to shout ""get on with it"" it was very engaging from end to end. I know some people don't like this show because of Penn's political views and commentary, and while personally I didn't find it extreme or offensive in even the slightest way, I think anyone booking a show should know that the people are going to have opinions and sometimes they use their platform to make them known. There are places they actually use it to great comedic effect. I don't pick shows based on the views of those starring in it, I am there to be entertained, and entertain you they do - I suggest others make their decision based on that also and not just because there is so much hype made about someone having an opinion. At the end of the show, both Penn and Teller are also right there for you to meet and get pictures with which is a really nice touch. I'd definitely be happy to see the show again. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Upon arriving at the restaurant, my husband and I were informed by the host that our reservations had been listed for the FOLLOWING night, obviously not what we'd requested. We were told to ""have a seat"", but that it might ""be a while"", since this was a Friday night. Not long after, we were seated at the most awkwardly placed table near the corner of the restaurant. Absolutely no view of the Lake (which was one of the selling points from everyone, and something I was looking forward to!), and we were crowded into a half-booth/half-table between two other couples. The serving staff was nice enough, considering we were terribly disappointed, but they didn't do much to make our experience any more personal, due to the fact that they were taking care of our ""boothmates"" as well. I lost my interest in ordering any appetizers, and focused on the steak. Now, that filet was AMAZING! So much flavor, cooked to perfection, and just wonderful. I was pretty anxious to leave after that, I just couldn't justify spending any more time and money here when I was not having a good time. So, we passed on the desserts as well (sooooo not like me!). I don't think I will be back here again, which is a shame because the food was fabulous! But right from the start we were made to feel as though we were a bother, since there was a mix-up with our reservation. The decor is beautiful and I'm sure the show is great, but if you're looking for a more intimate experience, keep looking! ",0,1,0,0,0

 I haven't tried this location yet but I am familiar with the Lenny's on 35th Ave and Thunderbird as I have lived in the area for years. Their burgers are very delicious as well as their fries. The only reason I don't frequent Lenny's too often is because I am so used to the fast food and cheaper prices. However, make no mistake about it the best burger in town is Lenny's so give it a try heck with today's value meal prices at other fast food places your not gonna pay too much more anyway unless you like the dollar menus.

 Meh. I was really looking forward to trying out Takamatsu. After all, it is right up the street from our house. Dude and I joined Sarah R. and a large group (15-20, I think, many dropped in and out) here for her Sendoff Dinner. Yes, the quality service tends to decline when larger groups are present. But what we experienced was downright unacceptable. Really rude server. Mumbled and spoke too quietly and we seemed like a giant inconvenience to her. Brought rolls to our table that belonged to no one in our party, and got visibly peeved (eye rolling, dirty looks, etc.) when one of us told her politely it wasn't ours. Good luck getting water or utensils. Dude and I ended up just sharing a glass. Trying to cash out or get a check was a nightmare. Another server approached our party and asked Dude and I if some rolls were ours. They need a better way to keep track of tickets. Got to the point we walked up to the cashier, told him what we ordered and paid. Also, another server on Sarah's end of the table got frustrated with a new guest to our party and RIPPED UP his sushi ordering sheet. In front of customers ... And was that really necessary? We probably made a mistake ordering sushi at a Korean BBQ joint. But hey, sounded tasty! Tried the Las Vegas, Tiger, Rainbow and Heart Attack Rolls. Everything tasted the same. Way too much rice, thinly cut fish (to the point it looked like just the skins), and the breading on the Vegas Roll was bready and soggy. Like it had been sitting out a long time. And don't even get me started on the culinary clusterphuk that was that Heart Attack Roll. Come on: Eel sauce + spicy cheese sauce + cream cheese + jalapeno pepper does not equal a palate pleaser. I did; however, get to taste a piece of Sarah's spicy pork dish ... That was excellent! The bright side to this place? We had a wonderful time enjoying the company of our friends, and Takamatsu was OK with me bringing a cake for Sarah. Despite the dismal experience, I wanted to come back and try the Korean BBQ. That is, until Dude got an epic case of food poisoning. Going on day two. And we're talking about a guy that almost never gets sick. Can count on one hand after nearly 9 years together how many times he's been sick. Not worth $8.95/roll; sure as hell wasn't worth an 18% gratuity charge. I'll stick to Shimogamo for delicious sushi that matches the price, and will be on the hunt for another Korean BBQ place. Spare your digestive tract and avoid the sushi. Stick to BBQ if you go.

 I've been taking both of my Persian cats here for over a year and a half and they always come back smelling and looking great. The owner is very friendly and I've never seen any signs of her being rough with either cat. The price to get a lion cut, a bath and trimmed nails is only 40 bucks which I consider a good price considering the art of shaving a cat! I had a hard time finding a groomer willing to groom a cat so was relieved when I asked her and she said she did in fact groom cats. The experience was so good I kept going back. I did one time deviate and got one cat groomed while home with my parents and it ended with him having a bald spot on his butt. That's never happened at All God's Creatures.

 I'm very much on the same line of Matt S. reviews. What the PHO do you want out of a 24 hour place? It's food, it's decent. It sops up your drinks. Sure not the best pho out there, but comparing it to daytime good places and moreso places in California where I'm from is just setting myself up for never having a good night. Don't get pho then if you're a pho expert or love broth. I don't get it much, it's broth is just not consistent enough for me after having it a few times. If I want soup, I get another kind or some congee. I think the other offerings are tasty and much better options. I tend to come here to get bun, rice plates or simple Chinese veggie dishes. Last night after some strong ales, the bun with bbq pork, eggrolls and shrimp cakes (added on) hit the spot. I think their bbq has great flavor and pretty damn good actually. If they took out the Pho and just stayed as Kim Long, I think it actually would be a solid restaurant. What brings them down in rep is their namesake. Most people get it and had better. SKIP the Pho, but it is a definite late night GO for other offerings. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Ironically enough, if you're willing to venture off the Strip in Vegas, sometimes you'll hit a jackpot. Poke Express is one of those type of gems uniquely delivering the Hawaiian islands flavor in the desert that is Las Vegas. We went at around 11am on Sunday and they had initially already sold out of malasadas. Fortunately, they were able to make another batch (w/in 20 minutes) and when fresh, these were amazing. Whether custard filled or just plain, the coating of sugar and the nice crisp flaky dough was tremendous. I recently had a batch frozen and delivered from Hawaii and these malasadas were comparable in quality. Then there's the star of the show, the poke. Really good poke to be exact. I can't attest to how it compares to poke in Hawaii but from all thirdhand accounts it matches up. Not quite there in terms of freshness but a close alternative. My favorite was the shoyu poke because the sauce is a great balance of sweetness that marinades the salmon or tuna to perfection. The spicy avocado poke was more spicy than I expected but having never tried avocado and poke mixed together, I thought it was pretty fantastic. I'd steer clear from the seaweed soaked poke as the salinity of the seaweed was too overpowering. They serve their poke by the 1/4, 1/2, and 1 lb sizes and we started by trying four different 1/4 lb. containers. Just a note, thats not nearly enough and we had to double up on what we ordered between two people. Overall, its affordable and delicious comfort food served with welcoming hospitality. It's like your own slice of Hawaii only a couple thousand miles away. Tip: Get here early, especially on the weekends, because at noon this place is jam packed with large parties. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Updated review, September, 2011. This Asian buffet has gone way down hill. Our last experience there was terrible. The food was just awful. The sushi was stale and no sushi maker in sight. I take back every bit of my previous review, I will not go back. (Previous review) If you like Sushi, you will like this place. At least 12 different sushi varieties. The buffet of Asian food was very good. The buffet does include American food which enlarges the appeal to families, not all 4 year olds are in to Asian. The food was excellent. The crab legs actually had flavor. The dessert bar was nice. We live near this restaurant and will go often. I hope it maintains its food quality and does not fall into the buffet trap of yuck food and skeezy presentation. For Asian buffets, this is the best in the nortwest Valley. ",1,0,0,0,0

 So married with three kids and needed a date night. I really wanted to change things up a bit to keep things fun. My wife and I like many are partial to great beer and great food. Throw a different location on top thats not the usual food chain and sometimes you get lucky. I live in north Phoenix so this was about a 40 to 45 minute drive. Well after all said and done very worth it. Went on a Saturday night and expected a long wait.... I don't even know how long we ended up waiting. That's because we were able to hang out at the bar and try some beers. Next thing you know we were at a table ordering food. Staff was friendly and punctual. Food was out quick and very pleased with the quality. Here are the bads. Parking pretty limited and it's far from our house. My wife was commenting on how she wishes there was one closer. Wants to try more of the food! Me too. ",0,0,0,1,0

 Louisiana fast! I haven't had Popeye's in forever mostly due to all the locations in Denver being in undesirable parts of town but it was right in the middle of our terminal at the airport so why not? Oh lord, I forgot how delicious their grub is! I got the chicken biscuit and their biscuit are flaky, fluffy and buttered to perfection, their chicken has just the right amount of crunch with a kick of spice that made it almost impossible to not scarf down in seconds. The employees weren't the most personable but oh well, I really wouldn't expect that much pizazz from a fast food place in the airport. ",0,0,0,1,0

 I hate to give this place a 1 star.. for the effort of staying open 24hrs, it atleast deserves 2 stars. But the service there is so horrible... I seriously could not do it. I witnessed something so irresponsible happened at this restaurant that could've gotten it into some major trouble if I wanted to complain about it. So instead of going straight to the health district, Im just going to let people who care enough to take time and read reviews about what they eat before they eat it know so that they can beware in the future. The other night at 4AM, I went to eat there with my boyfriend. We were around the area and decided to eat Korean food since that place was opened all night and had 20% off everything on the menu until 8AM. On first impression walking in, the place seemed clean and spacious with about three booths occupied at that time. The place itself is rather larger than most Korean restaurants, had a cozy feel to it and sits about 60+ people. It was bright with light and seemed suitable for late night gatherings with friends. But, that was about it on the plus side of our experience. The only waitress working there did not greet us immediately because she was too busy finishing up the spoon she was drying in her hands before getting to us. She was unfriendly, did not speak understandable English and looked as if she was pissed off because we had walked in and now she had more work to do. She sat us down at the table and I saw her immediately go back to finishing up her spoons. She didn't get us water or anything right away. I know most places, that's considered bad service, but I wasn't that picky to fuss about it at that time.The menu itself was similar to most Korean places. It had tofu soup, bbq and combination plates. Nothing too out of the ordinary, however, the price was about $5 more expensive than most places like Tofu Hut and Mr. Tofu. We got the combo with seafood tofu soup and Korean ribs to share and ordered an extra side of rice for $2. She did not bring our drinks out until we got our side dishes. When we ordered the soup, she didn't ask us about our preferred spice levels and didn't even bother to make eye contact with us or let us know she got the ordered. All she did was write it down, said nothing looking away, and walked off leaving us kind of dumbfounded. The side dishes were very skimpy for 2 people. I understood we only ordered 1 thing, but it was a combination that is close to $16 with $2 extra for rice. She didn't care to accommodate the platings for the party at all, even when it was complimentary. The soup itself came out boiling, but with dried soup spilled on the side of the clay pot. No one bothered to wipe it off. It wasn't like there was a small amount, you could tell a lot of the soup was spilled on the side. The soup itself tasted good, however. I enjoyed the taste greatly, but to be honest, it was the same as every other Korean resturaunt. Nothing that left a big difference. I noticed for the price they charged, our shrimp in the seafood was baby shrimp and very, very tiny. When our ribs came out at last (the combo pretty much came out one at a time), there was 6 pieces of ribs and looked very dry. What do you know, it was. The ribs itself was not marinated well enough, there was that sesame oil taste, and slightly sweet.. but that was pretty much it for the ribs. I did not enjoy the ribs at all. There was 2 people sitting next to us drinking the whole night we were there. On many occasions, I noticed the waitress came over and talk to them, and kept on standing there talking to them in Korean. She payed every attention to that table, and pretty much left us in a corner the whole night. She never bothered to refill our drinks or clean the table that left right when we got there across from us. It was dirty the whole night we were there. She even watched TV and talked to the cook instead of cleaning the table. OKAY so are you ready for this? One of the guys who were drinking was talking to her before we finished our food. He took out a cigarette and lit it up, smoking in front of our waitress. She did nothing, and continued talking to him in Korean. The other guy smoked afterwards and they both pretty much smoked in the restaurant, with us eating a booth away from them. My boyfriend and I were speechless. They ignored us and kept smoking. At one point, one of the guys got up and with smoke in hand, walked across the restaurant to the restroom hallway. I could not believe how irresponsible this waitress was being. If that was being allowed in the main lobby area, I wonder what goes on in the kitchen where they prepare our foods. I've gone to bars and karaoke lounges where they served food and let us use ""cups"" as ash trays. But that was different than an actual dine in restaurant such as this. It's like management letting you smoke inside a cheesecake factory. I could not believe it. This place is so corrupted. ",1,0,0,0,0

 I needed a good gynecologist and I found the best one ever when I went to this facility. On my first visit, I was immediately greeted by a friendly staff. I was seen by Dr. Dombo. I found her to have a warm and caring personality, a thorough approach to my healthcare, and accurate answers to all of my concerns. The office is clean, modern, and very nicely decorated, and the staff uses the latest technology to record patient information. This doctor is a keeper for me! ",0,0,0,0,1

 I was in Venetian for a quick lunch with my coworker. We were first in line to sit at the bar. However, the old lady who took our order was so rude and unfriendly that we will never go there again. She has no idea of customer service and based on her, I can only assume the worst about staff training in Venetian. I'm very disappointed to say that I will never recommend this place to anyone.

 We walked by this place, while strolling along the canal. Could not picture what/who would do it... So we had to try it. Booked the Trapeze 101 class same day. 1.5hrs for $50. Start time 5:30p. Cannot go wrong. Had a blast. Successfully did a catch at the end of the lesson. If you are even remotely considering participation, do it! Quite the adrenaline rush. ",0,0,0,1,0

 My Korean friend, who used to be married to a Chinese person, and I went here hoping for a really good meal. The food was terrible and very very bland. So pretty much authentic Chinese food. What made it worse is one year later I saw one of the employees leave the men's room without washing his hands, so again, very authentic. EWWWWW!! ",1,0,0,0,0

 I would definitely have to give a 5/5 stars for MGM based on my experience here. I booked a complimentary room through myVegas (facebook game that gives real Vegas prizes). Upon arrival, I noticed the extremely long line of people waiting to check in. This was at 6:00 pm too! I waited for about ten to fifteen minutes until I could talk to a representative to check in. I started to chat it up with the person that was helping me check in. I asked him if he had any complimentary upgrades available; perhaps a larger room. I was expecting him to say he did not have anything available because the hotel seemed so busy. He asked me to give him a minute. A minute passes and he tells me to hold on some more. He leaves the desk and comes back five minutes later. When he comes back, he tells me he has upgraded me to the a grand towers' suite room! I was in shock that he hooked it up, because I had tried the same thing at Aria, and she shot me down rather quickly. After that, I gave him a $20 and darted to the room. The room itself was all the way at the end of the 10th floor, which is good, because all the good rooms are at the end of the halls. When I opened the doors, I was greeted with a living room with a table, couches, chairs, lamps, and a flat screen t.v. I then opened the cellular shades with the panel on the wall, and was amazed by the fantastic view of the many hotels and casinos on the strip. After that, I walked into the bathroom and found his and her sinks, as well as a tub, and a separate shower. After making my way past the bathroom, I found the master bedroom. The view was not as spectacular as from the living room though. However, there was yet another t.v., as well as a table. This was definitely one awesome room. As for the hotel itself, parts are outdated, and other areas have been remodeled. I think it is a hit and miss regarding their rooms. I have read horrible reviews, and others being very positive. All in all, I had a very good experience for my first time staying here. Thank you kind sir for upgrading us for free, even when we already had a free room. It was greatly appreciated! ",0,0,0,0,1

 Went here for the first time tonight. I have a family of four and we all got an entree along with some egg rolls and Crab Angels. I am really happy with this place the Crab Angels were the best I have ever had. The Egg rolls were fabulous. All of our entrees were on par with or better than any Chinese food I have eaten in years. I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived to see that it was very clean and they have a window right into the kitchen. ",0,0,0,0,1

 Went in around the beginning of September, place was crowded and loud. Food was just ok, can't compare it to the best in Tukee, which is Florencia. We waited 45 minutes for our pizza before my husband went to get the manager. Woo hoo - given free dessert. Lame. This is one to skip. ",0,1,0,0,0

 We were doing some shopping at the Scottsdale Quarter and around Kierland and had decided to eat lunch here. I had read past reviews and had always wanted to try it. It was also really cute decor. I have been to France several times and felt they really nailed the ""bistro"" look so I was excited. However as soon as we walked in, the hostess immediately stopped us and explained that they have a dress code: men in tank tops are not allowed. As she's saying this, I see a family with small children wearing regular, casual clothing and another young woman dressed about as casual as you can get. Let me preface that this was late June with temperatures over 100 on a Saturday at lunch. I can understand a dress code for dinner but lunch? Here in Phoenix? Really?? I've been to weddings where people wore flip flops. I've lived all over and phoenix is by far a very casual place because its so hot. I was pretty surprised. Granted, the hostess wasn't rude about it but I guess I didn't see the place as being that high end. Needless to say, we left and went to North instead. Their staff was incredibly friendly. What a difference. I guess Zinc is taking the French thing literally. ",1,0,0,0,0

 The sandwiches do their job, but that's really all I can say for these nuggets. The tuna sandwich took me from hungry to full, but it was a little too salty and didn't have any special attributes. I always appreciate a unique and well thought out tuna sandwich (there are so many creative routes one can take when dealing with the art of tuna salad) but this one, I could've made at home. The spicy banana and cashew butter sandwich didn't work well, because there was almost no cashew butter (which was amazing...the little that I did taste, at least.) The bread wasn't toasty, so the whole sandwich was uniformly mushy, but it was satiating, nonetheless. Maybe I'd come back, but not until I've tried all the places next door that could also theoretically take me from hungry to full. ",0,0,1,0,0

 As a Taiwanese, I was very disappointed by this place. We ordered 6 dishes the other night and none of them were authentic. The owner clearly have not tasted real Taiwanese food before. Various items on the menu should not be considered ""Taiwanese cuisine,"" the spicy boiling fish pot for example. The service was ok but the food was quite pricy. I hesitate to recommend this restaurant if you are looking for authentic ""Taiwanese"" food. Personally, I will not go again. ",0,1,0,0,0

 This place probably gets the best lineup of bands in the Valley year-in and year-out. Owner Kimber Lanning is such a sweetheart and is constantly fighting to make Phoenix cool. This little shack of a venue (seriously, it fits about 43 people comfortably) has a decent sound system for its size, and a funky interior to boot. It's all ages all the time, so don't expect any sip and there's no BYOB option. This place can be hotter than a sauna in the middle of the summer (I don't care if there's a box fan or two) and is usually righteously loud. Whatever you do, skip the bathroom at all costs...run to the Krispy Kreme across the street. ",0,0,1,0,0

 If I was writing this review a few years ago-probably on a typewriter, I'd suggest that unless you wanted to see the movie badly, to save your money and wait a couple of months before it is on video. That was then. Now the multiplex theater has evolved from a place to see movies into an experience. Harkins Theater at Arizona Mills is the quintessential modern multiplex. Harkins Theaters at Arizona Mills features stadium seating. It was enjoyable to see Wreck It Ralph instead of the back of a stranger's head. The screen was enormous. Movie Theater companies have gotten smart and have gone back to building movie theaters instead of large rooms with a screen. In addition to the enormous screen, the surround sound put me into the action. Harkins Theater at Arizona Mills has a major advantage over many of their competitors. They are adjacent to a four star food court. In my case filling up at the food court's Nathan's put to rest my usual craving for expensive movie theater popcorn and cola. I felt that paying approximately $10 for a movie on Friday night was worth it. That is a couple of dollars more than fast food. I usually don't factor in service with a smile when I go to the movies. However, I give credit where credit is due. When the movie ended and the lights came back on, it was nice to hear the employees thanking us for visiting Harkins Theaters. Seeing a movie when we visited Arizona Mills was unexpected. We parked near Priest Road instead of I-10, on the side where Harkins Theater is. By the time the movie ended, the mall was closed and it was a long walk in the night to get to the car. Fortunately we did not leave a horror movie. I conclude this review with a tip. If you plan on seeing a movie, it will make a major difference parking on the side nearer I-10. ",0,0,0,1,0

 This old hotel has a convenient location with some rooms offering a nice lake or capitol view. The building itself, rooms, and furnishings are dated. Even in the upgraded ""Governor's Club"" the rooms seem old. The a/c units are noisy, the mattresses are old & lifeless, and worst of all, the walls are paper thin. You can hear your neighbors shuffling papers, talking, and flushing their toilets. The nicest thing in the room was the plasma TV. They offer free wifi on site but the signal was far from reliable. So there's an open bar if you upgrade to the Governor's Club. They advertise ""top shelf"" booze but it's really mid-shelf. The complementary breakfast, snacks, and desserts are hit or miss. There is a decent fitness center, sauna, and whirlpool. For serious meatheads the gym won't cut it. The cardio machines are adequate and there are lcd panels to watch TV but there is only 1 pulley machine and a very limited selection of free weights. Everything was clean and the pool area was relaxing when there were no crowds. The staff were pleasant and helpful during my 4 night stay. ",0,1,0,0,0

 I don't know how long acme has been an establishment, though I believe they are approaching a decade. That's saying a lot for a Scottsdale bar, though when you actually come here you have to wonder why. There is nothing here that sets this pseudo dive apart from the others. A long bar runs from forward to aft. Booths are squeezed in on the opposite side, and if you are not here during peak hours, you have room to breathe. Otherwise, forget about it. Bartenders and wait staff don't appear knowledgable or engaging, the bar is sticky and smells of college dorm room. Tidbit from the bartender is best night is Tuesday - jam packed with industry folks. Not open on Mondays, their happy hour begins at 5 and goes until 8. $2 domestics, $3 wells, and half off all appetizers and pizzas. It being a grill, the menu is filled with burgers, sandwhiches, and steaks. Apps are the typical dive bar fare...wings, skins, nachos, dips. Probably a good spot for tackling your hangover, not to take a date. ",0,1,0,0,0

 Arrived eager and excited to taste the food. Ordered fresh spring rolls without pork and waitress verbally confirmed the order with ""No pork."" The dish arrived shortly after the order was placed with pork in the spring rolls. After flagging down the waitress and having to explain the order that she verbally confirmed herself; she was reluctant to bring the plate to the kitchen window. Looking through the plate window which exposed the kitchen revealed a stack of pre-made spring rolls waiting to be plated after they were ordered. The ""fresh"" spring rolls are not made to order and are left sitting like fast food under a heat lamp! Main dishes arrived with overcooked/bloated noodles and non authentic broth. Beef boullion is not an acceptable substitute in Vietnamese noodle soup broth. Further observation revealed blatant health code violations such as servers going into the kitchen and preparing/handling food without washing their hands and employees using fingers instead of tissue to wipe their nose right before they handle food! Lastly, after asking a waiter to relay a message to the kitchen he admitted that there is a language barrier between the front of house staff and the kitchen crew; they don't even speak the same language!

 Dough boy...dough boy...dough boy... Cheese n stuff may have a large menu with something for nearly everyone but I just can't walk in there and not order my Dough Boy. Top it off with macaroni salad and an iced tea and I'm all set. On top of being mildly obsessed with that amazing sandwich, there's much to love in their little space. The friendly family that runs the place is always smiling and happy to see you and welcome all guests... high schoolers on their skateboards, businessmen in their Mercedes, white collar guys in their beat-up pickups...they all are mingling in that little deli. I've yet to go there, and I've been probably 20 times, and not have the owners know at least one guest by name when they walk in. This was orignally a meat and cheese shop back in the day, hence the name, and they still have some deli products to pick up if you feel like skipping Safeway's. It's an old-school, quiet place. It's always nice to dine-in and enjoy the quiet atmosphere and feel like you're not in the big city for a short time. It may be hard to spot the store in that little strip mall, so just look for the Dairy Queen...it's right next to it. ",0,0,0,0,1

So we thought lol and then we saw a different door and we found out that door was just stuck. And the girls working there were like laughing about it. And I guess they were like you need more muscles or whatever. Rudee!! They were like being all clumsy knocking stuff over and laughing. This girl came out from the door from the register and locked the girl out I guess and the girl locked out threw some cup lids at her. Totally unprofessional. I wont be coming back here again.
